THE FIRST WAS DEAD, THE SECOND LIVED.

BOTH DIED AT THE SAME TIME.

THE OLD WOMAN WENT ON: “SHE’LL SEE WHEN SHE’S OLD. SHE’LL NEED IT TOO.”

YOU FELT THAT THIS OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN TORTURED FOR YEARS, HAD BEEN INSULTED, HAD NO SELF-RESPECT, WAS CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTING, AND WAS THEREFORE USELESS TO ANYONE. YOU FELT THAT YOU’D BEST LEAVE THIS OLD WOMAN ALONE. YOU FELT THAT YOU COULD DO NO MORE, NO MATTER WHAT IT WAS. YOU FELT THAT YOU WERE LEAVING HER THIS WAY AND THAT SHE WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU. YOU FELT THAT YOU WERE BETRAYING HER, THAT YOU COULD DO NO MORE. YOU FELT STUCK, THAT YOU HAD LIED ALL YOUR LIFE. AND STILL, YOU LOOKED AT HER, AS ONE WOULD A CORPSE, AND MUSED.

ONE DAY, YOU RECEIVED A LETTER: “MY DEAR,” THE OTHER SAID. “IT’S TO SAY THAT I HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS WITH YOU.” YOU READ THE FINE PRINT: IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN THE PAST. IT ALSO SAYS THAT YOU HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS WITH ME. AND IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS. BUT IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO. SOMETIMES IT’S JUST THE OPPOSITE. SOMETIMES IT IS NECESSARY TO BE VERY PRECISE AND VERY KIND IN ORDER TO BE WRONG.

SOMETIMES, IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, IT IS NECESSARY TO KILL ONE TO WHOM YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF RELATIONSHIP WITH. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE, THAT THIS IS NEITHER ONE’S STYLE NOR HIS STYLE. IT IS NEITHER ONE’S NOR HIS PLACE TO SPEAK OF HIM. BUT HE IS A MAN, AND HE MUST BE LISTENED TO.

SOMETIMES, LATE IN THESE NIGHTS OF CELEBRATION, WHEN YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VERY ABUNDANTLY SERVED, IT IS NECESSARY TO PUSH THEM AWAY, TO GIVE IN TO ALCOHOL AND FOOD, TO MAKE WAY FOR THE NEXT GREAT EXPERIENCE.

HE IS BURIED BENEATH THE RUINS OF HIS FAMILY HOME.

THOSE WHO NEED MYTHS ARE INDEED POOR. POOR PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE NO MYTHS, AND SOMETIMES DIE WITHOUT HAVING KNOWN THEY WERE BORN.

A MAN IS CURED OF TYPHOID FEVER BY THE DEATH OF HIS FATHER.

TWO YOUNG MEN ARE IMPRISONED FOR STEALING AN AUTOMOBILE. THEY KILL THE MECHANIC WHO DISCOVERED THE CAR, AND THEN GO TO THE CEMETERY TO KILL THE FATHER AS WELL.

TWO YEARS LATER, THE SAME CEMETERY. SAME MURDERER.

BOTH ARE TORTURED AND KILLED.

THE FIRST MAN BURSTS INTO TEARS; THE OTHER DOES NOT WEEP.

THE TORTURED ONE REVEALS ALL.

THE MARTYR PLACIDLY ACCEPTS THE TERRIBLE FATE THAT HE LEAVES BEHIND.

THEY ARE NOT THAT KIND OF PEOPLE.

THEY ARE NOT THAT KIND OF PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT THAT KIND OF PEOPLE.

THEY ARE NOT THAT KIND OF PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT THAT KIND OF PEOPLE.

THEY ARE NOT THAT KIND OF PEOPLE. THEY ARE NOT THAT KIND OF PEOPLE.

I BEGAN WITH WORKS IN WHICH TIME WAS DENIED. LITTLE BY LITTLE I REDISCOVERED THE SOURCE OF TIME AND MATURING. THE RESULT IS THAT I NOW SPEND THREE TIMES AS LONG AS I DID IN THE LABORIOUS SEARCH FOR A THEME OR AN IDEA.4

I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE SEA ON THE BEACHES. AND, ON THE SHORES, I COULD GLIDE ALONG THE ROUGH SAND, BENEATH THE TOWERS OF THE NEARBY RUINS, AND SWIM AMONG THE SHEIKHS, SUN-KISSED BY THEIR STEEP PEAKS.

1) THE CHILD IS THE SAME AS THE ADULT IN ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. THIS IS BECAUSE THE FORMER IS SUBJECT TO BOREDOM, THE LATTER TO PAIN. THUS, THE CHILD IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE BORED, NO MATTER WHAT HE DOES.

2) THE ADULT IS NEVER GOING TO BE INDIFFERENT TO ANYTHING. HE WILL ALWAYS LIE, OF COURSE, BECAUSE DOING SO EXPRESSES CLEARLY TO HIM THE CERTAIN SUPERIORITY OF HIS THESIS. BUT, UNDERNEATH, HE IS NEVER GOING TO BE INDIFFERENT TO POWER.

BY THE TIME HE GOT TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL, THE FIRST MARS ROSE, ITS WHITE ROSY FLOWERS BURST THROUGH THE BLACKNESS OF THE SKY. LIKE THE TENDER AND SCARLET RADISHES, THEY TOO BURST THROUGH THE BLACKNESS OF THE SKY, RUSHED INTO THE VOID WHERE MAN HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF, AND YET STILL PULSATED WITH LIFE. LIKE THE ROSE OF NIGHT, THEY TOO FADED AWAY, EVENTUALLY VANISHING INTO THE NIGHT. BUT THE GRACEFUL NIGHT THAT FOLLOWED, IN THE FINE NIGHT SKY, WOULD LAST FOREVER AND SAVE IT FROM ALL DESTRUCTION.

FERDINAND AND ISABELLA.

THEIR LOVE FOR THE WORLD WAS AS BLIND AND AS VIOLENT AS THEIR DESIRE FOR PLEASURE. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN THEY WERE MARRIED, SHE HAD A YOKE OF OXEN TO DRIVE, WHILE HE HAD TO CLIMB ON THEM. HE WAS BORN FOR THE WORLD AND FOR HIS BRIDE.

AFTER HAVING READ HAWTHORNE'S APPRECIATIVE LETTER: "I EXPERIENCE A STRANGE FEELING OF SATISFACTION AND IRRESPONSIBILITY; NO DESIRE FOR DEBAUCHERY."

AND THEN HE MOVES ON TO DESCRIBE HIS OWN EXPERIENCE: "I EXPERIENCE A LIKE STATE OF HAPPINESS MORE OFTEN THAN NOT."

AND THEN HE MOVES ON TO DESCRIBE HIS BROTHER'S EXPERIENCE: "THAT OTHER, BY FAR, THE HAPPIER HE WAS THE MORE MISERABLE HE SEEMED."

AND THEN HE MOVES ON TO DESCRIBE HIS BROTHER'S EXPERIENCE: "HE BECAME LIKE SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE, SO LITTLE KNOWN, SO REPROACH HIMSELF FOR THE IMMENSE EMPTINESS IN WHICH HIS OWN SUFFERINGS WERE IMPARTED."

AND THEN HE MOVES ON TO DESCRIBE HOW HE RESISTED: "I BLED FOR YEARS FOR MY BROTHER."

AND THEN HE DESCRIBES HOW HE RESISTED: "I DIDN'T HATE HIM, I DIDN'T RESENT HIM, I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN."

AND FINALLY, HE ARRIVES AT THE POINT WHERE HE DECIDES TO WRITE HIS BROTHER A LETTER OF SYMPATHY: "I WROTE TO HIM ONCE, I STILL REMEMBER THE TONE OF VOICE AND THE MEANING OF THE LETTER."

BUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS PARTICULAR LETTER IS THAT IT SHOWS THAT EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE RELATED, MEN CAN BE AS CRUEL TO ONE ANOTHER AS TO ONE ANOTHER. IT IS A FACT THAT THEY CANNOT BE ARSED TO BE AS KIND OR AS FORGIVING. BUT THIS IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT SIDES.

I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED THE SOUND OF THIS COUNTRY'S RURAL ACCENT. IN THE COOL EVENING, THE WIND BLOWS ACROSS THE PLAIN. OFF IN THE DISTANCE, IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SEA, THE FIELDS GROW TALLER AND TALLER. THE SKY GROWS LIGHTER. FASTER STILL, AS THE DAY DRAWS ON, THE HEAVENS OPEN UP AND DUST AND LIGHT BECOME CONCENTRATED IN A SINGLE SWOOP. 
FASTER STILL, IN THE DIRECTION OF THE HORIZON, THE HEAVENS NARROW AND DUST APPEAR. AS THE DAY DRAWS ON, THE SPACE BETWEEN THE GREAT CYPRESSES GROWS DARKER. LESS CORN, LESS LIGHT. MORE SPACE, LESS PLANE. LESS CORN, HEAVIER, STILL BETTER.

MORE SPACE, HEAVIER STILL, STILL BETTER. THEN THE PASTORAL PAVILIONE.

I WAS FOURTEEN YEARS OLDER THAN I AM NOW.

ONE COULD SPEND A WHOLE LIFE INSIDE THE BODY OF A PERSON, ABSORBING EVERYTHING WITH AN INSULAR LOVE. BUT INSIDE THIS BODY, REAL AND FRAGILE, LIFE FLOWS FREELY, UNIMPEDED. THERE IS NO WAR, NO INSURRECTION, NO RESISTANCE. LIFE IS A LONG VOYAGE, A LONG VOYAGE OF DISCOVERY.

THREE SHIPS ARRIVED IN ALGIERS A LITTLE BEFORE NOON YESTERDAY. TWO IRONCLAD CONVOYS, THE ONE JUST OFF THE COAST OF NORTH AMERICA, CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR TWO IRONCLAD TRANSPORTS, ONE OF WHICH IS WAITING TO LEAVE PORT. THE OTHER, WHICH TRAVELS FROM POLE TO POLE, CARRIES PROVISIONS FOR ONE OR TWO IRONCLAD TRANSPORTS. THE DISTANCE IS THAT OF A DAY JOURNEY, AND THE WHOLE VOYAGE, IN ALL, TAKES LESS THAN A DAY.

THE FIRST SHIP, WHICH LEAVES PORT UNDER AN IMMENSE SKY, SAILS PEACEFULLY ALONG THE COAST, PARKS IN THE STRONG SOUTH-EASTERN SUNLIGHT, SLOWLY LIFTS OFF, ONE FINDS MYSELF IN A SORT OF BASIN, A SINGLE CLOUD THAT STRETCHES ACROSS THE SKY, GROWS LARGER AND FRESHENS, UNTIL FINALLY IT VANISHES INTO THE SEA. LESS THAN A DAY LATER, I AM IN BARCELONA, IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIELD OF RED CLOUDS, WHEN A BREEZE BLOWS THE RUINS TO THE LEFT AND GENTLY LIFTS ALL THE LEAFLETS OF THE CAMPIDOGLIO WALL, WHICH I HAD NOT SEEN IN TWO DAYS. THEN A TRAIN CHUFFS IN THE DISTANCE, STOPS IN ALGIERS, AND CLIMBS THE COAST, LIFTS OFF THE SOIL, GRAZES IT FOR A WHILE, THEN CLIMBS HIGHER AND, ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY, LEAVES OFF AGAIN. THE RUINS, HOWEVER, REMAIN, AND THE DAY BEFORE I SAW A FOOT IN THEM. SO MUCH FOR THE HOSPITALITY OF THE WORLD.

BUS 175.5 FROM PORTA NOVA TO GUBBIO. THE OLD MILL ON THE LEFT. THE FANCY DRESS STORE ON THE RIGHT. VITTORIO EBANDTIO.1 THE PEOPLE WAIT IN LINE TO BUY THEIR FLOWERS. IN FRONT OF THE SHOP, ON THE PORT'S RIGHT, THE FLOWERS GROW, TAKE SHAPE, DIVIDE INTO THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL PLANTS. THEN THE PEOPLE MIX THEM TOGETHER IN A JAR, PUT IT IN THE SLOT OF THE RAIL, AND DRIVE AWAY. THE TRAIN THEN CLIMBS THE COAST, SLOWS, STOPS IN AN OPEN FIELD, AND CLIMBS HIGHER AND IN THE TREES. IT MOVES ALONG THE COAST, UNTIL IT ENTERS A TUNNEL, CROSSES THE FLAT, DRIED-OUT GROUND, AND IMMEDIATELY OUTGROWS THE DRY GRASSES AND SHRUBS. UNDER THE MORNING SUN, A GREAT BLUE SEA STRETCHES OUT BENEATH THE SKY, A SINGLE BLUE FEATHER BEATS ACROSS THE SKY, THEN GROWS INTO A MASS OF FINE, FRESH FEATHERS, WHICH FUSE INTO A SINGLE BLUE JET. THE TRAIN THEN CLIMBS THE COAST, PASSES BETWEEN TWO MOUNTAINS, LIFTS OFF THE GROUND A FEW INCHES, AND TRAVELS ALONG THE SLOPES OF THE APENNINES, THE APURIMOS, AND THE FORI. THE PEOPLE THEN CLIMB THE LAST MOUNTAIN, PASS BENEATH THE GREAT CONCH, AND EAT THEIR FILL OF SHELLS, TEETH, AND FLESH. THEN THE DOORS OPEN ON A TRULY MAGNIFICENT SIGHT. THE SUN SETS AS, THE GATES BEING CLOSED, WE CLIMB THE RAMPARTS TO ENTER THE FIELD OF RUINS. LIGHT STILL COMES FROM THE EAST, BUT IT IS NOT LONG LIVED. BY AND BY, AS THE DAY DRAWS ON, THE MOON RISES, FLASHES BRIEFLY, AND THEN, LIKE A SALUTE TO THE HEAVENS, DROPS BACK DOWN TO REST ON THE EARTH. THE HOUR, THE DAY, THE NIGHT—THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE HOURS—THE FIRST OVER, THE DAY AFTER, THE NIGHT BEFORE, THE DAY AFTER THAT, THE NIGHT BEFORE, ETC.

FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST, THE OLD REPUBLIC OF TUNIS FEELS AT HOME. THERE IS NOT MUCH LOVE HERE FOR THE BODY, MUCH LESS FOR SENSUAL PLEASURE. INDEED, THE OPPOSITE OF THE PERFECT LIFE IS PERFECTION, AND THIS IS WHAT THE BODY NEEDS HERE. IT IS HERE THAT THE SOUL REALIZES ITS TRUE POTENTIALITY, THAT IT CAN DISCOVER ITS TRUE WEIGHT, AND, LIFTING ITSELF UP BY ITS OWN EFFORT, GROW IN PROPORTION AS IT WEIGHS DOWN ON THE BODY.

FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST, THE WOMAN ON THE TRAIN IS HARMONIOUS WITH EVERYTHING. SHE IS THE COMPLETE PERSON, IN OTHER WORDS, EVERYTHING THAT THE BODY IS NOT. THIS TRAIN, ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT MOVES SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY, PICKS UP SPEED, AND AT THE SAME TIME MOVES BACKWARD, LOSES SPEED, AND TRIPS SEVERAL TIMES. IT PASSES THROUGH SEVERAL TOWNS, THEN MOVES ON THE APURIMOS, PASSING UNDER THE RUINS OF WHAT WERE ONCE TEMPLES TO THE SUN, NOW THE RUINS OF WHAT WERE ONCE TOMBS OF THE SUN. AND, AS IT PASSES THROUGH MYKONOS, THE TRAIN FALLS SILENT, SAVES ITSELF, AND PICKS UP SPEED. TOWARD MIDDAY, HEADED FOR MYKONOS, A

SHE IS DRESSED AS A PEASANT AND LEADS A MERRY LIFE.

ONE DAY, GOING TO THE LAVATORY, SHE FINDS THE DOOR CLOSED. SHE TRIES THE LATCH, BUT IT IS NOT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HOUSE. SHE STANDS IN THE STREET, HORRIFIED UNTIL SHE FINDS THE RIGHT SIDE. THEN SHE PLAYS DUMB, WALKS SLOWLY THROUGH THE CROWD OF PEOPLE, KNOCKS VERY MUCH, AND IS ANSWERED BY ONE OF THE NEIGHBOURS, WHO PICKS UP SPEED. SHE IS THE FIRST ONE IN THE HOUSE. SHE IS THE LAST ONE WHEN SHE IS ARRESTED.

SHE IS SENT TO THE CEMETERY TO DIE. BUT THE GRIEF IS NOT YET OVER.

- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

- YES.

- THEN COME TO THINK OF IT, EVERY TIME I WISH TO SPEAK TO YOU OF SOMETHING, YOU HAVE SPOKEN TO ME 10 TIMES.

- YES.

- AND YET YOU NEVER MENTIONED IT TO ANYONE.

- NO.

- AND YET YOU ALWAYS SEEMED TO RELISH THE MOMENT WHEN I SPOKE

THIS MORNING, EARLY, I GO FOR A WALK IN THE OLD QUARTER. ON THE MAIN ROAD, THERE ARE ALWAYS THE CAFÉS AND THE TRAMS. BUT THE CAROB TREES EMIT THE SOUND OF WINGS AND CRIES THAT COME FROM THE JUNGLE. THE BIRDS OF LOURMARIN AND THE SEA ARE THERE, OF COURSE. BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF GREEN SPACE, BENEATH THE TREES, BENEATH THE GROUND TO BE BROKEN BY THE JOURNEY. BEYOND, THE PLAIN STRETCHES ON FOREVER, WITH ITS FOUR GREAT HILLS, ITS THREE SMALL ISLANDS, AND ITS CONSTANT FLIGHT OF WHITE HORSES. IT IS HERE THAT, THOUGH STILL IN THE SUMMER, THE GREEKS REMIND US THAT SUMMER IS OVER AND THAT, FINALLY, WE SHALL ARRIVE AT THE END OF THE JOURNEY. BUT HERE ALSO, BENEATH THE TENTS OF THE SUMMER, THE ARABS, THE NESTORIANS, THE HEAT, THE BANNISTER, THE KNIVES, THE SPEARS, THE BAYONETS, THE RIFLES, THE AMMUNITION, THE BAYONETS...

THE OLD MAN SANK HIS TEETH INTO THE EARTH, AND SPOKE: “THIS IS WHERE I’M GOING.” THE OTHERS FOLLOWED SUIT, AND BEGAN TO CRY. THEN THE CRY BROKE OUT IN THE GROUP, AND EVERYONE RUSHED TO THEIR KNEES. THE OLD MAN WAS KILLED.

“THIS IS WHERE SHE’S GOING.” THE OTHERS WERE LYING. THE TRUTH WAS THAT THEY HAD NEVER KNOWN HOW TO LOVE THE ONE THEY LOVED, AND THAT SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE THEY HAD KNOWN WHO COULD LOVE THEM BACK. TODAY, SHE WAS GONE. GONE WITH HIM, TOO, HAD BEEN THE TENDERNESS AND THE SENSUAL DELICACY. SHE WAS BORN IN THE MUD, ALONE, IN THE DEPTHS OF LOVE.

SUDDENLY, THE DOOR LEAPS OPEN. I’VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE. SOMEONE COMES IN. HE IS DRESSED AS A HINDU. HE SAYS: “THERE’S SOMETHING I WANT TO TELL YOU.” NOTHING HAS CHANGED. THE SAME OLD STORY.

HE SITS DOWN FACING THE OLD MAN. “YOU WERE ONCE A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, ONCE A MAN, NOW AN ANIMAL.” IT IS A TRUTH UNIVERSALLY ACKNOWLEDGED. BUT HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN IT? THE SPECTACLE OF HER ONCE MORE IN THE FLESH, IN THE BOND WITH MAN. HOW CAN WE EXPLAIN IT, IF WE DO NOT LOVE HER BACK? SHE IS THE ETERNAL MOUNTED FIGURE, THE MUTILATED BEAST, THE DEVOURED CORPSE OF SATIATION.

WE NEED A SYMBOL TO REMIND US THAT THERE IS MORE TO LIFE THAN MEETS THE EYE. A CORPSE CAN SERVE AS A SKELETON, A SKELETON CAN BE A SKELETON. AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF ALL BODIES. WHEN WE CUT DOWN A LIVING BEING, WE CHOP IT INTO THOUSANDS PIECES, AND ITS PARTS SCATTER IN THE WIND. THE WIND DRIVES THE CARCASS INTO THE NEAREST FIELD OF FLOWERS. OVER THE EMPTY CITY, A GREAT RED WHIRLWIND PASSES. THEN THE DEAD INTERMINGLE BENEATH THE MOON.

“NOTHING HAPPENS HERE.” THE YOUNG MAN POINTS OUT THE EMPTY LOT. “NOTHING HAPPENS HERE.” THE OLD WOMAN “IT’S A CORPSE.” THE OTHER MEN “IT’S A CORPSE.” SHE POINTS OUT THE GRAVES, THE MUTILATED REMAINS OF WHICH STILL RISE UP IN THE AIR. “THIS HOUSE,” THE YOUNG MAN SAYS, “MY WIFE WAS HERE.” HE IS MISTAKEN. SHE WAS NOT HIS WIFE. SHE WAS HIS SISTER. THEY HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR A YEAR. WHEN HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL, SHE WOULD NOT LET HIM GO OUT. SHE SAID: “HE’S MY BROTHER, I’M GOING TO CALL HIM THAT.” BUT HE WAS NOT REALLY IN THE SITUATION HE CLAIMED. HE WAS LIVING HIS LIE. AND AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED, HE WAS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

THE IMPORTANT THING WAS TO BE TRUE, NO MATTER WHAT. AT THE END OF HIS LIFE, PEOPLE OFTEN ASKED HIM: “WHAT WERE YOU THINKING ABOUT?” AND THE SIMPLE AND PAINFUL TRUTH WAS THAT HE DID NOT LOVE HER. HE COULD NOT GIVE THIS WOMAN ANYTHING BUT HATRED. AND YET THIS WOMAN WAS HIS SISTER, HIS TWIN, HIS BASTARD CHILD. HE LOVED HER, ALWAYS, AS A BROTHER.

SHE WAS GOING TO DIE, AND HE WAS GOING TO DIE, AND IT WAS GOING TO BE NECESSARY THAT THEY BOTH FLEE TO SOME DISTANT LAND, WHERE THEY COULD BE MORE SECURE FROM THE RAVAGES OF HUMANITY?

THEY WERE LIVING IN A VILLA IN THE SUBURBS, IN A BUILDING THAT WAS, IN A SENSE, RENOVATED. THE OLD WOMAN HAD DIED. THE NEW MAN HAD BECOME HER SUCCESSOR. SHE WAS LIVING HER FINAL HOURS IN THE SAME APARTMENT. AND, IN A SENSE, THE WHOLE THING WAS FALLING INTO PLACE. SHE WAS GOING TO DIE, AND HE WAS GOING TO DIE, AND IT WAS GOING TO BE NECESSARY THAT THEY BOTH FLEE TO SOME DISTANT LAND, WHERE THEY COULD BE MORE SECURE FROM THE RAVAGES OF HUMANITY?

TOOTHLESS AND BAREFOOT, IN THE FREEZING COLD, I CLIMB THE BANK OF THE GENESE, A PASSAGE THAT LEADS TO THE SEA. ON THE RIGHT, FROZEN IN THE SNOW, THE ROAD DESCENDS SLOWLY, WOODSY AND TENDER. TOWARD NOON, UNDER A SKY THAT TURNS GREEN AND FADES INTO THE DISTANCE, THE LAST TRACE OF THE SUN FADES AWAY, TURNS RED, AND FINALLY DISAPPEARS INTO THE SEA. HERE, UNDER THE NIGHT, THE WORLD DIES AND IS REBORN.

THE SWEETEST SOUND, THE MOST TENDER TOUCH, MELTS AWAY BENEATH THE NIGHT. THEN UNDER THE NIGHT, THE ROAD TO THE SEA. ENDLESS, FOREVER RED.

AFTER AN HOUR ON THE ROAD, ONE SEES BRU, THE SEA, AND BRU'S MERRY SMILING FACE. THE JOURNEY, IN THE FADING LIGHT, GROWS MORE SOLEMN. LONG, SOLEMN, AND DISCONCERTING.

STOP IN TURIN WITH THE YOUNG ARCHAEOLOGISTS DOING THE EXCAVATIONS. THEY TALK ABOUT THE LOVE OF THE PLACE AND ABOUT THE END OF THEIR MISERABLE EXISTENCE.

TURIN, A CITY OF STONE AND BONE, BENEATH THE SNOWY ALPS, IS COVERED IN THICK SNOW. ITS WELL-ROUNDED AND WELL-SEPARATED STONE, WITH A GOODLY DEPRESSION IN THE MIDDLE, THAWS AND THEN SPRINGS BACK, THE FIRST RAIN FALLING IN THE MORNING. THE WHOLE OF THE CITY CRUMBLES BENEATH THE RUINS. A GREAT SADNESS RISES, CLEARS AWAY, BECOMES A LITTLE SPEECH. THEN EVERYTHING COMES BACK TOGETHER. THE TEPID WATERS OF THE GENESE, THE BAY IN THE DISTANCE, THE RUINS THEMSELVES COME BACK TO LIFE. MORE SILVER AND MAUVES THE CITY. SAME THING IN SIENA.

DECEMBER 8.
VERY COLD AND RAINY DAY. IN THE MONTORIO NEIGHBOURHOOD, IN THE DRY STONE OF THE PALAIS DORIA, THERE ARE STILL MANY FINE STONES, SOME FRESH, OTHERS ALREADY DETERIORATED. BUT THE WHOLE OF THE STONE THAT FALLS INTO THE HARBOUR IS RUINED. ONLY THE THIN FRAMEWORK OF THE PORTA DELICTO, THE HARBOUR, AND THE HARBOUR ITSELF REMAIN. BUT THE WHOLE OF THE CITY BURSTS INTO LIFE ERUPTS IN A DEAFENING SOUND, AND THEN, LIKE A SUDDEN RAIN, THE OLD RUINS THAT REMAIN APPEAR AND ARE DESERTED.

CORRESPONDANCE.

FOR X. (AND HER FAMILY) LOVE IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DEMAND. SHE CANNOT BE (AND THIS IS A TERRIBLE PAIN) DEMAND ANYTHING OF ME. FOR HER, LOVE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN GIVE VOLUNTARILY. AND IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MOUSTACHE!”

FOR ME, TENDERNESS IS SOMETHING I HOLD IN MY HEART, SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS FELT, ALWAYS WILL FEEL, A SORT OF CONSTANT AND IRREPLACEABLE LINK TO SOMEONE.

TO START GIVING IS TO CONDEMN ONESELF FOR NOT GIVING ENOUGH, EVEN THOUGH ONE GIVES EVERYTHING. AND DO WE EVER GIVE EVERYTHING-

- YES, WE DO. BUT ONLY RARELY ENOUGH.

- AND NEVER ENOUGH.

- AND NEVER ENOUGH.

TOTALLY CONTRADICTING HERSELF, SHE WRITES: "OF ALL THE LOVE I HAVE EVER FELT FOR SOMEONE, THIS IS THE MOST PRECIOUS."

DECEMBER 9.
FOR X. (AND HER FAMILY) LOVE IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DEMAND. SHE CANNOT BE (AND THIS IS A TERRIBLE PAIN) DEMAND ANYTHING OF ME. FOR HER, LOVE IS SOMETHING SHE CAN GIVE VOLUNTARILY. AND IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MOUSTACHE!”

THE VALUE OF LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE.

NEGOTIATE AMICABLY. BUT DO NOT MAKE DEMANDS TOO DEMANDING. THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE A HAPPY MARRIAGE. AND IF SHE GIVES ONLY MINIMAL, IF NOT NO, EFFORT, SHE IS DEMANDING IN HER SPOUSE. EQUALLY, IF SHE HAS EVER BEEN OF USE TO YOU, SHE IS NOT OF USE TO ANYONE ELSE.

KRAL MAJALES

I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO PLACE THE BLAME FOR KRAL MAJALES’ DEATH, BUT I KNOW THAT IT WAS NOT NEGLIGENCE OR INSUBORDINATION THAT CAUSED HIM TO LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS. IT WAS HIS ARTERIES THAT COLLAPSED.

IT IS TRUE THAT HE CIRCLED THE GLOBE, MAKING NUMEROUS TRIPS, WITHOUT FINDING THE PLACE HE WAS LOOKING FOR, AND THAT HIS BRAIN WAS INCAPABLE OF SUSTAINED ATTENTION. BUT WHAT MATTER? HIS DEATH WAS A REMISSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT AFTER HIS DEATH M. MAJALES INFORMED DIEN BIEN PHU THAT HIS DEATH WAS A VICTORY FOR HIS SPIRIT.

MAJALES WAS AN ATHEIST AND THEOLOGIAN. HE HAD PUBLISHED A BOOK, LA VIE CHÈRE       MONSIEUR, THAT CONTAINED HIS REFLECTIONS ON THE EXISTENCE OF GOD.

ABOUT THOSE FRENCH CARICATURES THAT HE USED TO SIT ON

AND EAT A SQUASH, A CARROT, AND A MELON.

THEY WERE CALLED LILIES: THE CRIMINAL

PART OF HIS PERSONALITY. AND THEY DID,

AS THEY DID EVERY MONDAY AT THE OBSEQUIERS.

HE WAS ON THE TOP OF THE CLASS: HIS WIFE

AND THEIR SON WAS GOING TO GRADUATE. THEY CALLED

THEMSELVES HAPPY EVEN THOUGH THEY DIDN’T QUITE KNOW WHAT THAT MEANT.

IT WAS DURING THIS YEAR THAT THEY DECIDED

TO MOVE THEIR WEDDING FROM FRANCE TO THE SOUTH.

THERE THEY WOULD HAVE MORE FREEDOM: THEY COULD CHOOSE

OTHER PLACES TO SETTLE. FOR EXAMPLE, MOROCCO,

A LITTLE ISLAND OFF THE COAST OF AFRICA. BUT IF THEY WANTED

TO SETTLE IN BOUVILLE, THEY CALLED IT A COUNTRY.

WHICH THEY DID, TO CELEBRATE THE LIBERATION OF THE CHOIRMASTER.

WHICH WAS EXACTLY RIGHT—AND WHICH I THOUGHT WAS SO

FINE THAT I DIDN’T GIVE IT ANOTHER THOUGHT.

EXCEPT ONE SUNDAY, THE NEXT DAY, THE PARTNER

OF A FRIEND I HAD MADE YEARS BEFORE. AND HE WAS AFRAID.

LIKE ME, HE HAD RESERVATIONS. I MEAN

THAT IN THE EXPLOSION OF CHOICE THAT WAS

AHEAD OF US, WE HADN’T THOUGHT TO ASK WHAT

WAS GOING TO HAPPEN TO OUR OLD MAN. AND THEN,

ONCE MORE, THE OFFER WAS OFFERED TO ME.

TO SAY NOTHING OF WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
SO ON THE FIRST DAY OF DECEMBER,

I WENT TO THE POLICE STATION WITH MY FRIEND

WHO WAS WANTED IN CONNECTION WITH A BANK ROBBERY.

THE STATION WAS ON THE OUTSKIRTS

OF THE TOWN, ALMOST A MILE AWAY.

IT WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING,

AND THERE WERE NO SUSPECTS.

I WALKED THE HALF-MILE FROM THE STATION

TO THE CRIME SCENE.

MY FRIEND WAS WANTED FOR BURGLARY AND ROBBERY.

I WANTED TO USE HIM AS I’D USED MY OTHER BOY:

BOLD, INEXPERIENCED, YET WITH ALL HIS YOUNG

MEMORY. HE AGREED TO TALK.

THE BURGLARY OCCURRED ON THE MAIN STREET

OF THE TOWN, IN A HOUSE

SHARED BY TWO FRIENDS, A BACHELOR

AND A DANCER. THE FRIENDS HAD BEEN DRINKING

AND HAD BEEN DISORDERLY.

THE BACHELOR HAD A BROKEN JAW,

AND THE BROKEN JAW OF THE FRIEND WHO’D HELPED HIM

CRAWL AROUND HIS LEGS IN THE DIRT.

THE FRIENDS HAD ALSO BEEN DRINKING.

THEY HADN’T BEEN DANCING, BUT

THEY COULDN’T SEEM TO GET OUT OF BED

WITHOUT A CHORE. THEY CALLED

FOR THE DOCTOR, AND HE POINTED OUT

THREE GLASSES OF BLACK BEER

ON A TABLE. HE BLEW INTO A CIGARETTE

AND TOLD THE FRIEND WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM

TO THE DOCTOR’S INPATIENT ROOM. THERE

WERE THREE GLASSES OF BEER, THREE CIGARETTES,

TWO PITCHERS OF ORANGE JUICE, TWO CANS

OF SODA. THERE WERE FOOTPRINTS

ON THE WALL AND FURNITURE.

HE BLEW INTO ANOTHER CIGARETTE,

AND TOLD THE FRIEND WHO HAD BROUGHT THEM

TO THE DOCTOR’S THAT HE WAS GOING

TO TAKE HIS OWN LIFE. THAT HE WAS SICK

OF BEING LIED TO. HE HUNG UP.

WENT ON WITH HIS LIFE, THOUGH.

HIS BOWLING TROPHIES AND SAMMY DAVIS’

ALBUMS FILLED WITH HIS MISTAKES.

HIS CLOTHES RATTLED. HE PEELED

AT HIS NAILS. HE WENT TO THE DENTIST

WITH HIS SCREWDRIVER, AND THE

DOCTORS TOLD HIM HE WOULD HAVE

TO PUT A PLATE OF WHOLE GRAINS

INTO HIS MOUTH IN A FEW DAYS.

HE SAID, WHATEVER, AND WENT

FOR A WALK WITH HIS FRIEND, SONNY,

WHO WAS SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT.

AT THE END OF THE WALK, SONNY

SUGGESTED THAT HE AND HIS FRIEND,

SCOTTO LAVINA, SHOULD TAKE A WALK

TOGETHER, IN CASE ANYTHING HAPPENED.

JUST SONNY AND SCOTTO, AND THEY

TOOK THEIR WAYS, IN FINE FORM,

TO THE EDGE OF THE TREELESS MEADOW.

THERE WERE A FEW ROCKS THROWN

INCLUDING A ROCK THAT FLEW AWAY

WITH THE FIRST SWING. BUT NOTHING ELSE

TO WORRY ABOUT.

THE FRIEND WHO HAD BROUGHT US THERE,

HE AND HIS WIFE, HAD BEEN

VERY ACCEPTING OF OUR MARRIAGE.

THEY OFFERED US ROOMS IN THEIR HOUSE

AT THEIR OWN ASKING. (WE REFUSED.)

WE HAD TO MOVE

EARLY BECAUSE THE NEXT MORNING

WE WOKE TO RAIN

OUTSIDE. AN HOUR LATER,

EARLY IN THE MORNING, IN A DIFFERENT

2) WE HAVE COME TO ASK THE QUESTION: IS EXISTENCE A SIN?

3) WE MUST RENOUNCE OUR ILLUSION OF UNIVERSAL REASON, WHICH HOLDS US BACK; AND WE MUST RENOUNCE, IN ADDITION, OUR ILLUSION OF THE TRANSCENDENT, WHICH WOULD FREE US FROM THIS DOWNWARD SPIRAL UNLESS WE CEASE TO ASSOCIATE IT WITH EXISTENCE.

4) WE ARE THE LAST TO RENOUNCE OUR CONDITION, SINCE WE ARE ITS FIRST VICTIMS.

5) IT IS WE, THE FIRST TO RENOUNCE IT.

6) IN THE ANNUNCIATORY TONE WITH WHICH AUGUSTINE OF HIPPO DELIVERS HIS SERMON, THE RESIDENTS OF ARLES RING THEIR BELLS TO PROTEST AGAINST A VISITATION BY SAINT SIMEON.

DECEMBER 3.
THE LIGHT AND HEAT OF THE ZODIAC ENTER INTO ME, ENTER INTO ME, AND I AM FILLED WITH THEIR PRESENCE. I AM LIKE A FISH THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BREATHE, TO EXPLORE, AND TO LAY DOWN ITS HIDE. I CONCEIVE AND EXPRESS MYSELF THEN AS AN ABSURD CHARACTER ON A PAR WITH THESE LUMINARIES; AND LIKE THEM, I CONCEIVE AND EXPRESS MYSELF AGAIN AS AN ABSURD CHARACTER ON A PAR WITH THESE LUMINARIES.

FOR A SINGLE JOY OF WHICH THE SEASONS ARE CAPABLE, I BEAR WITNESS TO THE INACCESSIBILITY OF THE CYCLE OF THE LIGHT, AND TO THE NON-PARTICIPATION OF THE SEASONS IN ITS CONSTRUCTION. I REMAIN ON THE LEVEL OF THE LIGHT AND HEAT, AND PARTICIPATE IN IT, LIKE THE ANCIENT HERAKLEION, IN THE OBSCURITY OF THE TOMB.

DECEMBER 4.
THE LIGHT AND HEAT OF THE ZODIAC HAVE COME TO ME, AND WHEN WE COME TOGETHER IN THE EVENING THE STAGE IS SET FOR A GREAT PERFORMANCE. THE STAGE IS ILLUMINATED BY THE EVER BURNING C

“YOU’RE GOING TO EAT?”

HE BLUSHES VIOLENTLY.

“EH? OH, PARDON …”

HE SAYS IN A DRY VOICE, “JUST NOW I THOUGHT OF EATING …”

“OH, YES,” SHE SAYS, “JUST NOW I THOUGHT OF EATING …”

“OH, ME!”

HE SAYS IN A SOBER VOICE, “YOU KNOW IT … THE … THE FLESH-EATING …”

“YES,” SHE SAYS IN A DRY VOICE.

“YOU KNOW IT … THE FLESH-EATING …”

“YES,” SHE SAYS IN A DRY VOICE.

“WELL, I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE …”

SHE EATS OF A PIECE OF DRIED FRUIT. THERE IS A WHIFF OF ALCOHOL IN HER MOUTH.

“NO, NO.”

“YOU’RE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE.”

“NOTHING ELSE?”

SHE EATS A PIECE OF DRIED FRUIT. THERE IS A WHIFF OF ALCOHOL IN HER MOUTH.

“I’M NOT DRINKING—”

“NO, NOT YET. LET ME CHECK. FIRST I’M GOING TO BED AND I DON’T REMEMBER WHAT I’VE DONE.”

SHE SITS DOWN ON A CHAIR. IN THE MIDST OF THINKING ABOUT WINE AND COOKING, I SUDDENLY HEARD A NOISE.

“IT’S NOISE OF FOOTSTEPS.”

“YES.”

“I WENT INTO THE BATHROOM TO TAKE CARE OF MY WOUNDS.”

“NO, YOU DIDN’T GO INTO THE BATHROOM.”

“I WAS THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE.”

SHE READS THE NOTE ON THE TABLE. THE ATMOSPHERE IS LIGHT, THE LANGUAGE IS CLEAR. THERE ARE A FEW EXPRESSIONS ON THE PAGE, NONE OF WHICH SHE RECOGNIZES.

“OH, MY GOSH!”

THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN THROWS A COAT OVER HIS HEAD AND STANDS TO ATTENTION.

“WHERE ARE YOU GOING, MONSIEUR?” HE ASKS.

“TO THE LIBRARY.”

HE PUTS ON AN APOLOGETIC LOOK.

“AND HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL ABOUT BEING IN LOVE?” HE ASKS.

“IT’S VERY ROMANTIC. I’VE HAD MANY WOMEN. ALL OF THEM HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD TO ME.”

“YES, BUT YOU’RE NOT GETTING ANY YOUNGER.”

“I KNOW,” HE SAYS. “I KNOW, I KNOW. I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT I’D BEEN ABLE TO GET FROM THEM, YOU KNOW. THE LIBRARY CARD, THE LETTER IN THE ENVELOPE.”

“I DON’T THINK SO.”

“I MEAN THAT IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO YOU STARTED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT,” HE SAYS WITH CONVICTION. “YOU SEEMED TO SAY THAT THE LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW.”

“YES, I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT MY LIFE. I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT MYSELF A LOT, YOU AND YOUR MAGAZINE.”

“YES, I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE RIVAROL AFFAIR. IT WAS ALL VERY QUEER. YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE I TALKED TO ABOUT IT.”

“HA, HA!” SHE SAYS IN A DRY VOICE. “YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE, YOU KNOW.”

“YEA, I WAS THE ONLY ONE,” HE SAYS PROUDLY.

“BY THE WAY, HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?”

HE ANSWERS WITHOUT APPARENT DEJECTION.

“I GUESS SO.”

“HAS IT BEEN VERY LONG?”

HE DOESN’T ANSWER, HE SCRATCHES THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD.

“SO LONG AS YOU’VE BEEN MARRIED, MONSIEUR,” HE SAYS WITH DIGNITY.

“YES, MONSIEUR, I’VE BEEN DRINKING. IT’S A QUESTION OF WILLPOWER.”

“HOW MUCH HAS DRINKING COST YOU?” HE ASKS, WITH THE IRONIC LOOK OF A MAN WHO HAS JUST BEEN BETRAYED BY HIS WIFE.

“A LOT,” I REPLY.

“AND HOW MUCH HAS IT COST YOU?”

HE DOESN’T ANSWER, HE SCRATCHES THE SIDE OF HIS HEAD.

“HOW MUCH HAS IT COST ME?” HE ASKS TIMIDLY, “YOU’LL PAY FOR THIS, WON’T YOU?”

THERE IS A SAYING THAT YOU MUST NOT TELL A LIE UNDER TEN YEARS OLD.

MAY 1ST.
LAST TRAIN. LUNCH IN GENOA. DO NOT LOSE HEART. I TELL MYSELF IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN AND THAT I MUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT CERTAIN DAYS ARE WORSE THAN OTHERS. A MONTH LATER, A VERY SAD DAY. I GET OFF THE TRAIN IN THE GENOA QUARTER. SAD, BUT JOYOUS. THE STATION IS FAR FROM PLACES LIKE BASTILLE OR CENTRAL STREETS, AND YET IT IS NEAR, AS I GO DOWN THE RUE DEL GARD IN ORDER TO THROW LIGHT ON WHAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED IN THE PAST. A BIG HOUSE SITTING ALONE IN THE MIDST OF THE LAUREL. THE HOUSE FILLS ME WITH ITS OWN WEIGHT, WITH ITS OWN HEARTBEAT, WITH ITS OWN SINS, AND ITS PAST. A VERY OLD AND VERY LOVING MOTHER. AND THE INNOCENCE OF A FEW WOMEN. ONE DAY, I IMAGINE, THEY WILL LOOK AT ME AND SAY: “IT WAS X WHEN I WAS FIVE,” IN A LAST EFFORT TO FIND THE LOVING MOTHER THEY NEVER HAD.

THE BREATH OF BIRDS.

THE BODY IS WHAT GIVES LIFE ITS SHAPE, ITS REASON FOR EXISTING.

THE CONFRONTATION.
WHEN LOVE BECOMES MERGED WITH THE IMPERSONAL, THE SPECTACLE OF THE WORLD IS REDUCED TO THAT OF THE HUMAN STRUGGLE, AND IS REPLACED BY THE URGENT STRUGGLE OF MAN AGAINST HIS CONDITION. THE LIFE OF MAN IS TO BE JUDGED BY THE STANDARDS OF THE HUMAN STRUGGLE, AND NOT BY THE HUMAN JUDGE: THE FORMER FIGHTS FOR THE HONOUR OF THE HUMAN CONDITION; THE LATTER, AGAINST HIS CONDITION, FIGHTS FOR THE TRANSCENDENT.

(THE DEEPEST REASON, AFTER ALL, IS THAT THE DIVINE INSTITUTION ISLAM, THE IDOLATRY OF THE IMPERFECTION OF BEINGS, THE ABOMINATION OF THE DIVINE FAVOR. ALL JURIDICAL SYSTEMS ARE OPPOSED TO THIS AIM OF THE ABSURD MIND, WHICH IS TO BE GROUNDED IN THE NOTHINGNESS OF MEN AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE.)

DECREPIT WARRIORS.

THEY ARE THOSE WHO SAY: “WE ARE WARRIORS, SAY WE, NOR FOOLS; WE HAVE SEEN WARS, AND, BEFORE TAKING UP OUR WEAPONS AGAIN, WE SHALL SEE . . .”; THEY ARE THE NEW WARRIORS, THE ONES WHO SAY: “WE ARE PLEBS, SAY WE; BEHOLD, GOING IN, WE ARE THIEVES; BEHOLD, WE ARE NOTHING BUT A HORDE OF PUTRESCENCE AND BLEAR TASTE, A SWARM OF FILTHY LITTLE CHILDREN OF THE MOST CORRUPT COUNTRIES.”

THE POINT IS TO LIVE OR DIE, AND NOT TO GROW OLD IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ABSURD.

THE ONLY THOUGHT THAT DOES NOT LEAD TO AN ABSURD THOUGHT IS A THOUGHT THAT IS NOT ABSURD.

ID.: “YOU SEE, I HAD HOPED FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE. I HAD EVEN CONTEMPLATED SUICIDE. I WAS WAITING, BREATHLESS, FOR A SIGN, A BECKONING FROM THE ABSURD. AND THEN, SECURITY, THE ONLY ATTENTION, THAT STRANGE FEELING OF NOT BELONGING TO THE BODY, THE ONLY THING THAT A HUMAN BEING CAN OFFER TO THE ABSURD—IT IS THE ONLY LASTING ATTENTION THAT AN ABSURD THOUGHT CAN HAVE.”

THE MYTHICAL QUALITIES OF THE GRAVE.

THERE IS A SAYING OF DEATH THAT IS UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED: IT IS LIGHT ITSELF. BUT IT IS THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY THAT IS UNIQUE. THIS IS BECAUSE DEATH HAS ONLY ONE DIMENSION: IT IS THE UNION OF LIFE AND DEATH. BUT THE DIMENSION OF THE ABSURD IS ENORMOUS: IT IS THE UNION OF ALL THE WORLDS IN THE GAMUT OF BEING, OF FORM AND FUNCTION. THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY IS THE COMMON THREAD THAT LINKS ALL THE DEAD TOGETHER.

THE BODY IS NOT UNIQUE IN ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS: IT IS, ON THE CONTRARY, THE ONLY BEING THAT CAN OFFER A MEANING TO LIFE. WHETHER THE ACTOR IS A GOD OR A MONSTER DEPENDS ON WHETHER HE INVOKES THE ABSURD. IF HE DOES NOT, IF HE FAILS TO INVOKE THE ABSURD, HE IS NO MORE A GOD THAN A MONSTER.

THE FAILURE OF THE ABSURD IS RECOGNIZABILITY. IT IS A TEST OF THE INTELLIGENCE.

COSMOGONY OF THE SELF-TAUGHT MAN.

I FELT THE NEED OF LOVING THE WORLD AS IT IS, WITHOUT DILUTING MY OWN LIFE, IN ORDER TO ILLUMINATE THE ABSURDITY OF HUMAN EXISTENCE, AND SO I PURSUED A CAREER IN PHILOSOPHY, A CAREER THAT GAVE ME THE LEEWAY TO BE FULLY MYSELF. I WAS READY TO TAKE UP RESIDENCE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL GHETTO, TO HIDE BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF THE ABSURD, AND SUCCEED WHERE SO MANY OTHER MEN HAVE FAILED. I DREAMED OF ENCLOSING MYSELF IN A BOX, TO IMPOSE MY WILL ON THE WORLD, TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE ABSTRACT VOID OF THE ABSURD. BUT THE PHILOSOPHER, CRAWLING WITH WORMS AND INEFFABLE TEARS, HAS ALREADY TURNED INTO THE ULTIMATE DEFENCE OF THE ABSURD, AND IS THE GREATEST ENEMY OF THE LIVING.

ID.: HE DELIGHTS IN HIS LECTURING.

I’D EVER DONE,

AND I’D DONE IT FOR A FRIEND.

POEM FOR MY FATHER
MY FATHER IS DEAD,

AND I’M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY

ANYTHING. BUT I WANT

TO MAKE A SCENE, BELIEVE ME.

IT’S NOT RIGHT,

MAN, OR WOMAN,

TO BE TYPING THIS IN A DARK

AFTER CALLING A SUICIDE HOTLINE.

SO HERE’S A POEM, BELIEVE ME,

FOR MY FATHER, THE ONE

WHO FED THE PIGEONS

IN THE PETALS OF HIS FANCY.

IT’S TIME MY FATHER WENT,

OR MY MOTHER TOOK HIS PLACE.

THE PIGEONS WENT, AND THE SHOPKEEPER

QUIT HIS JOB, TOO. SO THERE’S NO WAY

TO GET MY FATHER BACK, OR ANYONE

ELSE’S, FOR THAT MATTER.

I’M NOT WRITING TO GET LAID, OR EVEN

TO PASS THE TIME, OR TO GET WELL KNOWN.

I NEED PEOPLE, OR I’M NOT WRITING.

I NEED A POET WITH A NAME,

RECOGNITION, AND A POEM TO STAND ON.

LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE FARMER WHO LOST HIS CROP

OR HAD HIS WIFE KILLED DOWN THERE

LIVED IN A COTTAGE A DISTANCE

FROM WHERE HE COULD WATCH

THE SHIFTS IN THE MOONS

AND KNOW THEM BY. THE COTTAGE HE CALLED HOME

YIDDISH FOR 'LITTLE LORD'

AND THE WEATHER IN THE STREETS

HE DESCRIBED AS FOUL

AND OPPRESSIVE. THERE MUST BE SOME TRUTH

TO THAT COTTAGE AND THAT STREET

IN WHICH WE NOW CROUCH

WITHOUT KNOWING THE HOURS, OR THE DAYS,

AND WEATHER ALIKE. BUT TODAY

THE WEATHER IS MILD,

THE CROPS ARE IN DANGER,

AND ALL OUR FOLK IN DANGER.

SOME OF US HAVE BEEN THROUGH WORSE

THAN OTHERS; SOME OF US HAVE BLED

MORE THAN OTHERS; SOME OF US

HAVE HAD OUR GOODS STOLEN FROM US

AND ARE STRUGGLING NOW

AGAINST ALL THE BLOOD IN THE WORLD.

I’M NOT WRITING MY BOOK ON SARTRE; I’M WRITING ABOUT HIM AS A WRITER, OF WHOM I AM ONE OF THE WRITERS. I HAD HOPED THAT SARTRE WOULD THINK ME A SYMPATHETIC AND INTELLIGENT WITNESS. WHAT HAPPENED INSTEAD IS QUITE SIMPLE. I BEGAN TO WRITE AN “ODE TO THE POLICE” AND AN “APOTHEOSIS OF THE FRENCH POLICE” AND A FEW ARTICLES ON THE POLICE AND JUSTICE. THEN I READ THE RESULTS OF THE – AT THE TIME UNTHINKABLE – PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION AND DECIDED TO LEAVE THE LIBERAL PARTY. I STILL IDENTIFY WITH THE LIBERAL PARTY EVEN THOUGH I THINK ITS OLD GUARD IS BAD. I WAS RIGHT TO CHOOSE IT; BLAIR’S REFORMS WERE TOO RADICAL. BUT I WAS NOT SO SURE OF MYSELF ANYMORE: I WAS CAST OUT, BETRAYED, AND DISGRACED. I HAD BETRAYED MY IDEALISM; I WAS CAST OUT, AND STAGNATED. I HAD BETRAYED THE GREAT LEADER I THOUGHT I WAS FOLLOWING— BLAIR’S TURN!

NOW I AM BACK IN THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY ANCESTORS. MY MOTHER, WHO CARRIED THE POOR TO THE DOOR, STILL REMEMBERS THE WAY THEY CAME DRESSED UP AS NEGROES TO GO TRICK OR TREAT IN THE NIGGER QUARTER OF THE TOWN. MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER, WHO INSISTED ON WEARING A BLACK DRESS WHEN SHE CAME FROM THE BLACK DISTRICT, STILL HAS HER HAND IN HER HAIR. AND I, TOO, HAD A BLACK SLAVE’S LIFE IN OUR HOUSEHOLD. FOR EXAMPLE, I USED TO BEAT THE SH*T OUT OF OUR BLACK SERVANT, NELS, AND I KICKED THE *** OUT OF OUR BLACK CHAUFFEUR. BLACK PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KICKED OUT OF OUR HOUSE ALSO. MY FATHER HAS BEEN ARRESTED A FEW TIMES, AND ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS HE HAS BEEN THERE, TRYING TO KICK THE CONSTABLE OUT. HE IS A THORN IN THE FLESH, SAYS HIS CONTEMPORARY, AND THIS THORN HAS DRIVEN NAILS INTO HIS THUMBNAIL. HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN THERE MANY YEARS, SAYS NELS, AND THEY NEVER LEFT THE HOUSE EXCEPT ON SPECIAL DAYS. THE FAMILY HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRONG, SAYS NELS, AND IF ANYTHING HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ONE OF THEM IT HAS BEEN THE FAULT OF THE FAMILY.

SO THE GUILT OF OUR FATHERS LIES NOT SO MUCH IN OUR MOTHERS AS IN OUR FATHERS, WHO HAVE BEEN OUR SLAVES FOR A LONG TIME. HAVE WE SEEN AN EXAMPLE OF CLEMENCY, OF MERCY, OF CARE AND ATTENTION PAID TO US BY OUR FATHERS? WHAT ARE WE NOW WITHOUT OUR ANCESTRAL GRAVES? AND YET THIS IS NOT THE WAY OUR ANCESTORS DIED: THEY ARE LAID OUT IN A TOMB NEITHER MEN NOR WOMEN HAVE LAID A FINGER ON THEIR FACES, THEY ARE BLANK BEYOND THE EYES, AND EVEN THEIR DEATH HAS BEEN CLEANSED OF ANY TANGLES OF FOLK TALES, ANY FOLK RELIGIOSITIES. IN SHORT, OUR ANCESTRAL GRAVES HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY DUG UP AND CONTAIN NOTHING BUT THE SKELETON OF OUR IDEAS AND OUR ATTACHMENTS.

ON THE OTHER HAND, OUR EUROPEAN ANCESTORS WERE GIANTS. THEY DID NOT WANT TO DIE OUT OF FATIGUE, NOR TO SEE THE END OF THEIR LIFE IN A TOMB. THEY TOOK THEIR REVENGE BY MAKING THE WORLD INTO WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BORN, AND BY SHOWING HOW MUCH THEY HAD SACRIFICED TO THE IDEA OF LIVING. THEY IMAGINED A REDEEMER FROM WHOM THEY COULD SHINE, WHO WOULD SHINE IN DEATH, A CONQUEROR IN DEATH, AND SO ON. IN THIS WAY THEY CIRCUMVENTED THE PROBLEM OF DEATH, WHICH THEY THOUGHT WOULD DESTROY THEM. INSTEAD OF RESTING ON THEIR LAURELS IN THE CEMETERY OF THEIR LAST NIGHT, THEY HAVE MADE THE TOMB THEIR DWELLING-PLACE, AND THE TOMB THEIR SOLE HOPE.

HOW DO WE KNOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE IN A SUNLESS CEMETERY? THIS IS WHAT WE SEE ON ALL THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KILLED. THE CROWDS OF MEN AND THE STURDY BUT LIVID FACES OF THE PAST ARE WASHED AWAY IN THE PRESENT; THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KILLED HAVE TOO OFTEN CEASED TO HAVE A TEXTURE, TO HAVE SIGNIFICANCE. WHAT WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD IN COMMON WITH OUR ANCESTORS WAS THEIR REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO AUTHORITY. THIS REFUSAL HAS NOT DISAPPEARED, NOR IS IT LIKELY TO DISAPPEAR ANY TIME SOON. BUT THE FACES, THE PERSONALITIES, AND THE SECRETS OF OUR PAST HAVE ALL BUT DISAPPEARED, EITHER BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN CO-OPTED BY AN OLDER, WISER, MORE POWERFUL GENERATION, OR BECAUSE THEIR LIFE HAS BEEN TAKEN IN HAND BY A YOUNGER, MORE DARING.

SO THE FINAL STAGES OF OUR EVOLUTION HAVE DISAPPEARED; OUR FEELINGS AND OUR NOSTALGIA HAVE JOINED THE PROCESSION OF TIME; WE NO LONGER FEEL THE NEED TO HIDE ANYTHING, TO KEEP OUR LOYALTIES SECRET. WE ARE THE JUDGE AND THE ACCUSED. TIME CANNOT PRONOUNCE OUR INNOCENCE; WE ARE NOT INNOCENT, AND WE KNOW IT. WE ARE TRIED AND CONDEMNED AS WE ARE THE ACCUSED.

WHAT IS THE USE, THEN, OF AN EXPLANATION, OF A PALLIATION, OF A PALLIATION FOR THE ABSENCE OF AN EXPLANATION? IF THE CAUSE IS INSUFFICIENTLY RECOGNIZED, WE HAVE SUFFERED TOO MUCH FROM THE AMBIGUITY OF OUR INTUITIONS AND OUR

IN THE EVENING OF APRIL 21–22, 1953, DR. ZAIDMANN RETURNED TO HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH SARTRE. THE SUBJECT WAS “THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE.” THE DISCUSSIONS WERE TAPE-RECORDED AND ARLETTE PREPARED A PREFACE FOR THE FIRST EDITION OF THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE.

SARTRE’S HEALTH WAS NOT IMPROVING AND HE REALIZED IT; HE SAID, “I THINK I’M GOING TO HAVE FITS OF DIZZINESS.” THE UNDERLYING CAUSE OF HIS TROUBLE WAS HIS SWALLOWING. IN TWO CONVERSATIONS WITH VICTOR HE HAD WITH DR. B. ASPIRIN, A SPECIALIST IN GINGIVAL NEUROPATHY, HE HAD CONTRACTED A PARALYZING ATTACK OF MECHANICAL IN THE SWALLOWING. HE STOPPED PARTICIPATING IN ANY STRENUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR THREE MONTHS AND FROM THAT TIME ON HE ONLY DRANK HALF THE AMOUNT HE WANTED TO. WHEN HE WENT BACK AGAIN WITHOUT THE AID OF A VENTILATOR HE VOMITED BLOOD. AND ON THE OTHER HAND HE DRANK NOTHING DURING THE THREE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED.

AS A RESULT HIS LEGS GAVE WAY AND HIS ARMS AND SHOULDERS GAVE WAY. HE STUMBLED AS HE WALKED AND HE COULD NEITHER SIT NOR STAND UP STRAIGHT. ONE DAY AS HE WAS GOING TO HAVE A TALK WITH SYLVIE HE FELT SO DIZZY THAT HE HAD TO GET THE APPOINTMENT FIXED. WHEN HE CAME BACK FROM THE SHOPPING TRIP HE VOMITED BLOOD.

ON APRIL 13 AND 14, 1953, GUILLAUMAT, MINISTER OF THE INTERIOR, MET SARTRE AT THE ELYSEE. HE WAS RATHER NERVOUS, HE SAID, BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID THAT THE EPISODE MIGHT AFFECT HIS HEALTH IN ANY WAY. “IT’S NOT THE WAY I WAS BROUGHT UP TO LIVE,” HE TOLD SARTRE. “AND I DON’T WANT TO DIE IN THE WAY I WAS BROUGHT UP.”

ON APRIL 13 AND 14, 1953, THE FIRST DAY OF MY ILLNESS, I PARTICIPATED IN A MEETING OF THE HISTORIANS, POLITICAL ACTIVISTS, AND JOURNALISTS WHO WISHED TO BREAK THE NEWS OF THE ASSASSINATION OF DR. MIKHAÏL STERN. THERE WERE NOT MANY PARTICIPANTS, BUT THE ATMOSPHERE WAS LIVELY.‑—ALBERT CAMUS

ON THE FIRST DAY OF HIS HALF-BLINDNESS, SARTRE WENT TO THE OCULIST’S WITH ARLETTE. THE OCULIST TOLD HIM THAT HIS CONJUNCTIVA HAD BEEN REMOVED AND THAT HE WOULD NEED AT LEAST A YEAR FOR THE MOST EFFECTIVE HEALING. SARTRE STILL SAW HIS DOCTOR, BUT THEY DID NOT TALK. ON THE MORNING OF THE SECOND DAY, WHEN HE WAS DIZZY AND HAD DIFFICULTY IN SPEAKING, THE DOCTOR PRESCRIBED A DOSE OF PILOCARPINE AND ADVISED HIM TO GO TO THE NEARBY CATHOLIC HOSPITAL. SARTRE WAS TO SMOKE LESS AND TO UNDERGO A SERIES OF DRASTIC INJECTIONS. IN TWO MONTHS, THE OCULIST ASSURED HIM THAT HE WOULD RECOVER ALL HIS SIGHT AND HIS MOTOR SKILLS.

THE NEXT DAY, MAY 2, HE TOOK PART IN A MEETING HELD BEFORE THE IVRY TOWN HALL. THE POLICE WERE ON THE ROOF, AND A FRENCHMAN WHOM BOST HAD INVITED, A SINGER WHO WAS CONDUCTING FOR A CHORAL GROUP, HAD BEEN KILLED THERE. THE MURDERER WAS UNKNOWN, BUT THERE WAS GOOD REASON TO SUSPECT THE SINGER, SINCE HE HAD BEEN ASKED FOR THE ROLE OF THE BLACK PANTHER IN A TELEVISION PROGRAM THAT WAS TO BE SHOWN ON MAY 1 IN THE CITY. CONCERNED CITIZENS APPROACHED THE SHOW AND DEMANDED THAT IT BE PULLED FROM THE STANDS. THE PRODUCERS REPLIED THAT THEY WOULD NOT WITHDRAW IT, AND THAT THE MURDERER WAS MERELY A STAGE ACTOR WHO WOULD SOON BE BANNED FROM THE THEATER.

MAY 3.
THE FIRST LIGHT OF THE DAY WAS SHED ON THE TOWN BY THE ABLUTIONS OF THE SUN. SARTRE RETURNED TO HIS READINGS WITH ARLETTE. IN THE EVENING HE WENT TO PLAY POKER WITH BOST.

IN THE MORNING THE YOUNG PEOPLE FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS CAME TO HAVE LUNCH AT THE CHÂTELET STATION. SOME HAD ALREADY GONE, SOME RETURNING AFTER HAVING DRIVEN AN HOUR, AND SOME WHO WERE JUST BEGINNING THEIR JOURNEY. SARTRE WON THE FIRST GAME. HE SAID, “I PLAYED A VERY GOOD GAME. I WAS DRINKING, OF COURSE, BUT I DIDN’T LET THAT INTO MY GAME. I PLAYED WITH INTEGRITY.” LATER HE TOLD CONTAT HOW HE FELT ON HIS BICYCLE, WALKING ALONG THE RUE BOULIBET: “PROBABLY THE MOST EXHILARATING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.”

THE NEXT DAY THE SUN SHONE AGAIN, BUT THE HEAT WAS UNBEARABLE. AS WE WERE LEAVING THE STATION GRIS IN THE EVENING, SYLVIE TOLD ME, “HE DIDN’T WANT TO COME UP THE COTEAU VERT SO BAD.” “OH, YES,” HE REPLIED, “HE DIDN’T WANT TO COME NEAR THE BELVEDERES AT ALL.” WHEN I ASKED HIM, HE REPLIED, “I DON’T KNOW WHY, BECAUSE IT WAS SO BEAUTIFUL.�

THE NEXT DAY, DECEMBER 2, THE WEATHER WAS STILL DAZZLINGLY BEAUTIFUL. SARTRE WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE WORK HE HAD DONE IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR; HE WAS PLEASED WITH THE BOOK HE WAS WORKING ON, AFTER ALL, AND HAD NAMED IT “SELF-PORTRAIT AT SEVENTY.” HE SAID THAT SINCE IT WAS A NOVEL HE WAS NOT GOING TO WORK ON IT ANY LONGER; HE WAS GOING TO PUT IT ON HIS OWN TERMS. “THERE ARE A FEW INACCURACIES,” HE OBSERVED, “BUT EVERYTHING’S BEEN CLARIFIED.” AND HE SPOKE OF THE MANY DISCUSSIONS THAT TOOK PLACE DURING THIS YEAR. “I HAVE RECONSIDERED MY THOUGHTS ON CERTAIN SUBJECTS. BUT I HAVE NOT DONE SO FOR FEAR OF DISAPPOINTING THOSE FRIENDS WHO STILL THINK I AM WELL KNOWN.… MY CASE IS DIFFERENT; I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF HAVING WRITTEN A BOOK THAT WAS DESTINED TO BE SO WIDELY READ THAT AT LAST I WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER FOR IT. WELL, YES: BUT NOT FOR WHAT I THOUGHT THEN. AND NO, BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHTEST RECOLLECTION OF IT.

“DID SELF-PORTRAIT PROVOKE YOU IN ANY WAY?”

“NOT IN THAT IT CONCERNED ME DIRECTLY. BUT INDIRECTLY?… IN A WAY.…”

“BUT NOT IN A WAY?”

“NOT IN A WAY. . . .”

“BUT WHAT DID PROVOKE YOU IN THE WAY?”

“I MEAN THAT IF I READ SELF-PORTRAIT AMONG THE MANY VISITORS, ONE OF THEM, A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS COMING FROM AN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY, HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS FAVOURING HIM, THAT HE WAS GRANTING HIMSELF PRIVILEGES BY WAY OF COMPENSATION. I TOOK NO NOTICE OF IT, I WAS NOT ENTERTAINED BY THE SPECTACLE OF THE MAN SUFFERING, BUT I WAS FILLED WITH A SORT OF UNWONTED AND INVOLUNTARY GENEROSITY. AND I REMEMBER DISTINCTLY—I’M NOT JOKING—I HAVE HAD SUCH FEELINGS FOR SOME WOMEN I WAS VERY FOND OF. AMONG THEM I WAS PARTICULARLY FOND OF MINNIE, OF VIVIENNE, OF M. AND MME BOVARY. I WAS PARTICULARLY PARTIAL TO M. BOVARY, BECAUSE HE HAD SO OFTEN BEEN MY COMPANION AT THE SAINT-CYR. UNFORTUNATELY, HIS HANDS WERE TIED BY AMERICA’S REFUSAL TO GIVE HIM AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP. HE HAD BEEN AN AMERICAN CITIZEN SINCE THE YEAR BEFORE I JOINED THE ARMY.

“WHEN DID YOU LEAVE THE ARMY?”

“I WAS A CIVILIAN. . . .”

“DO YOU REGRET IT?”

“YES. I SHOULD THINK SO.”

“SO DO I.”

“YES, BECAUSE . . . .”

“SO YOU WERE A CIVILIAN THEN?”

“YES.”

“AND YOU WERE TERRIBLY PROUD OF IT?”

“I WAS TREMENDOUSLY PROUD OF IT. I WAS WAITING FOR THE FRENCH TO EXPEL ME, THINKING THEY WOULD EXPEL ME MYSELF. BUT NO, THEY EXPELLED ME. I HAD BEEN A MEMBER OF THE STAFF, I HAD BEEN AN OFFICER, IN THE ARMY. AND NOW I AM GOING TO TURN IN DISGUST.”

“AH YES, YOU DISGUST ME,” M. ACHILLE SAYS, WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE SAYS.

“YOU DISGUST ME,” M. ACHILLE SAYS, WITH THE SAME TROUBLED LOOK.

“I WAS A NONENTITY, MONSIEUR, HARDLY A PERSON, I NEVER HAD ANY DEFINITE CONCEPTION OF WHAT I WAS OR WHAT I STOOD FOR, I WAS AN OBJECT, A PRETEXT. AND I STAND BEFORE YOU THIS EVENING, I HAVE BEEN AN OBJECT, A PRETEXT: YOU SEE I’M GETTING OLDER, I AM OLD, I AM ALONE.”

HE IS LOOKING AT ME WITH A SORT OF COMPLICATED EXPRESSION, HE IS CAREFUL, HE MAKES SURE HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS HAPPENING TO HIM: HE IS GOING TO TELL ME SOMETHING:

“I TOOK AN OVERDOSE OF PILLS, MADAME, I TOOK THEM IN THE EVENING, I GOT UP THE NEXT DAY AND WALKED ABOUT WITH MY HAT ON. I WAS A NONENTITY, MONSIEUR, HARDLY A PERSON, I NEVER HAD ANY DEFINITE CONCEPTION OF WHAT I WAS OR WHAT I STOOD FOR.”

THIS IS A PLOT: IT SEEMS TO M. ACHILLE AS IF HE WERE TELLING A TRAGIC OR RIDICULOUS STORY. THE TRUTH IS THAT HE HAS BEEN TELLING IT FOR YEARS. HE HAS A FAVOURITE ANECDOTE, M. ACHILLE WOULD BE MONSIEUR, HE HAS PUT IT IN HIS BOOK, SIMPLY, AS HE CALLS IT, “SELF-PORTRAIT AT SEVENTY.” THE THING IS THAT ACHILLE, WHO KNOWS TOO MUCH ABOUT LIFE FOR US SIMPLE-MINDED PEOPLE, PUTS ON A WRY SMILE, HE IS FLATTERING, HE IS AWARE THAT HE IS

THIS IDEA THAT IN ORDER TO BE HAPPY ONE MUST BE CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SUFFERING HAS REMAINED VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED THROUGH THE AGES. IT IS THE ABSURD CONSEQUENCE OF THIS LIMITATION.

THE BRIEF IS OVER
WHAT IS LEFT FOR US IN THE PRESENT? TO WHAT ARE WE INDEBTED FOR THE BEAUTIFUL AND DECISIVE WORDS OF THE PAST? TO WHOM DO WE OWE THE EXQUISITE ART OF LIVING, ENTRUSTED TO THE CARE OF OTHERS? THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS WHICH THE PAST AND THE PRESENT OFFER US. BUT THESE ARE QUESTIONS WITHOUT URGENCY. FOR THE SAME REASON AS WE ACCEPT THE INFINITE AND THE CIRCUMSCRIBED, WE ACCEPT LIFE WHEN IT IS OVER AND WE CAN TALK OF IT WITHOUT EXCITEMENT.

WHAT IS GIVEN, WHAT IS DESIRED, BUT THE ILLUSION OF A CERTAIN WISH, THE WISH TO BE HAPPY, THE WISH TO BE HEARD ALL PRAISE AND NOT ONE CRITICISM? WHEN THIS ILLUSION IS COMPLETE, WHEN ALL THE PIECES HAVE FIT INTO ONE INDETERMINATE WHOLE, WHEN THE WHOLE IS COMPLETE, WHAT IS NOT?

WHAT IS NOT YET LIFE BUT AN ENORMOUS FREEDOM, A LIMITLESS GIFT WHICH OUR HEARTS CAN RECEIVE IN ADDITION TO THE DAILY REQUIREMENTS, A MARVELOUS AND IRREDUCIBLE JOY WHICH OUR DESIRES CAN GIVE US IN ADDITION TO THE MARVELOUS AND INEXPRESSIBLE JOY OF BEING BORN.

THE FUTURE
THE PRESENT AND THE SUCCESSION OF OBJECTS CONFRONTS US WITH THE PROBLEM OF THE ROOTS, OF DEPTH, AND OF DECEPTION. SINCE THE PERSISTENCE OF THESE CATEGORIES IS AN OBSTACLE TO THE RECOGNITION OF THE ABSOLUTE, THEY POSTPONE THE PROBLEM OF THE ROOTS. BUT THE PROBLEM OF THE ROOTS REMAINS, SINCE IT IS COMPOSED OF THE SUBJECTIVE CONTINUITY OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE AND THE OBJECTIVE RHYTHM OF THE WORLD. IF WE WERE ABLE TO CONFRONT IT, IF WE COULD SAY “THIS IS THE PROBLEM OF THE ROOTS” WITHOUT WAITING FOR CONFIRMATION, IT WOULD BE A TRANSCENDENT EXPERIENCE, AS IT IS A TYPE OF JOY. BUT THE SENSATION OF THE ABSOLUTE IS NOT INHERENT IN THE WORLD; IT EMERGES FROM THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE WORLD AND FROM THE MUTUAL INTERPLAY OF THESE CONTRADICTIONS AND THE DYNAMISM OF OUR INSTINCTS. IT IS A WORK OF ART.

THE PRESENT AND THE DECEPTIVE WOMAN ARE THE PREDECESSORS OF THE ABSURD MAN. SHE WHO REJECTS THE LIE AND SINGS ABOUT LIBERTY AND EQUALITY WILL BE THE EQUAL OF THE ABSURD MAN. SHE WILL SING ABOUT LOVE AND THE ABSURD.

THE POSITION OF THE ABSURD MAN IS TO BE A BRIDGE BETWEEN THE WORLDS OF REASON AND THE ABSURD. HE MUST MAKE A DISTINCTION. THE ABSURD MAN RECOGNIZES AS HIS OWN THE CONTRADICTIONS OF THE WORLD AND THE CONTINGENCY OF ITS REACTIONS. HE RECOGNIZES ALSO AS HIS OWN THE SINGLENESS OF THE ABSURD WOMAN WHO, REFUSING THE LIE, SINGS ABOUT LIBERTY AND EQUALITY.

* * *
    THERE EXISTS A NECESSARY COMMON MEASURE BETWEEN THE WORLD OF THE ABSURD AND THE WORLD OF CONSCIOUSNESS. THE DISTINCTION IS NOT ABSOLUTE. THERE ARE ABSURD MEN AND THERE ARE CONSCIOUS MEN. THE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE LIES IN THE DEGREE OF FRICTION BETWEEN THESE TWO WORLDS. THE FORMER ARE CONSTRAINED TO THEIR OWN LIMIT, WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE REASON, WHEREAS THE LATTER ARE FREE TO GO BEYOND THIS LIMIT, IF THEY SO CHOOSE. IT IS A QUESTION OF ADMITTING THAT THEY ARE NOT WHOLLY EQUAL. THE FORMER MERELY APPEAR; THE LATTER ARE ASSERTED. WHAT IS TRUE OF THE ABSURD IS EQUALLY TRUE OF THE CONSCIOUS MAN AND OF THE ABSURD WOMAN. THEIR RELATIONSHIP WILL BE DIFFERENT. WILL THEY BE EQUALS? OR WILL THE FAINTEST APPEARANCE OF IMPOTENCE SEPARATE THEM?
    THERE IS THUS A FUNDAMENTAL TENSION IN THE ASSERTION OF THE ABSURD. IN THE WORLD OF THE ABSURD THERE IS ONLY ONE WORLD, AND IT IS THAT. THE REST OF THIS ESSAY IS CONCERNED WITH THE RELATIONSHIP OF THESE TWO WORLDS. THEY ARE UNEQUAL, THAT IS ALL THAT CAN BE SAID. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO STRESS THIS, FOR TWO CONTRADICTORY REALITIES, IF THEY ARE TO BE UNDERSTOOD, MUST BE DISTINGUISHED. THEY ARE NOT EQUIVALENT. IF THE WORLD OF THE ABSURD IS ALLEGED TO BE THE WORLD OF CONSCIOUSNESS, THE STRANGE AND PIQUANT REALITY OF THE WORLD OF CONSCIOUSNESS MUST BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE STUFF OF THE ABSURD. NOW, IT IS ALLEGED THAT THE WORLD OF THE ABSURD IS THIS, AND THAT OF THE CONSCIOUS MAN IS THIS. THIS ABSURD IS AKIN TO THE MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE OF THE SPECTRE. IT IS ESSENTIAL TO STRESS THIS BECAUSE THE PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD OF THE ABSURD IS AT THE SAME TIME THE PERCEPTION OF THE ABSURD AND OF THE TRANSCENDENT. IT IS BOTH PERCEPTION AND REALIZATION OF THE WORLD OF THE ABSURD. IT IS NOTHING LESS THAN THE UNION OF THESE TWO FRAGMENTS OF THE WORLD OF MAN, ACCORDING TO REDWALL.
    I AM NOT SPEAKING HERE OF THE NOTION OF AIM. I MEAN MERELY THE WAY IN WHICH THE WORLD OF THE ABSURD IS ALLEGED TO BE EXPERIENCED. BUT I WANT TO QUESTION THE TRADITIONAL ATTITUDE OF VIEW, WHICH IS SUMMED UP IN THE REMARK: “EVERYTHING WHICH IS DONE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE ABSURD IS DONE SO IN THE EXPECTATION OF ITS RETURN.” IF THE EXPECTATION IS NOT DISPELLED, THE ABSURD IS BORN. IT IS HOPED, AND THIS IS ALL, THAT THE MOMENT WILL COME WHEN THE

WHAT I LIKED BEST IN PARIS WAS THE MUSIC HALL AT THE CHATELET, WHICH WAS FULL OF THE RICH AND COARSE HUES OF TURIN AND FROM WHERE WE COULD WATCH THE BRILLIANT PIGEONS FLYING IN THE BRIGHTLY LIT AIR. I ALSO LIKED THE PEOPLE, WITH THEIR RICH STORIES AND THE VIVIDNESS OF THEIR GESTURES. THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW, SOMETHING ORIGINAL, ABOUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE I SAW. THERE WAS THE MAN IN THE BOOTH AT THE OPERA WHO GAVE A STIRRING ACCOUNT OF HIS LIFE WHILE SINGING THE LAST SONG OF THE CONCERT, AND THEN HE CALMLY HELD THE SHEET OF MUSIC IN HIS HAND, FOLDED IT IN HIS POCKET, AND SAID: “I HAVE SPENT MY LIFE IN A HAPPY TANGLE, WITH MY PARENTS AND MY WIFE.” THERE WAS THE MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WHO, FOR THE FIRST TIME, FOUND HIMSELF FREE OF HIS PARENTS. HE WAS A BACHELOR, BUT HAD BEEN WITH AN EXISTING UNION. HE HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP THROUGH THE RANKS BY HIS OWN EFFORTS; HE HAD BECOME A PARTNER AT AN EXISTING UNION. AND HE SPOKE WITH THE FIRMNESS OF AN EMPLOYEE IN A TEXTILE MILL. HE HAD ONCE BEEN UNEMPLOYED, HE SAID, AND HAD THEN FOUND WORK AS A DISHWASHER. HE HAD A SON, HE WENT ON TO TELL US, AND HAD TO PAY HIS RESPECTS TO HIS FATHER WHO WAS STILL WORKING. “IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME COMING,” HE SAID, “BUT I AM FINALLY HERE.” HE HAD A POINT: HIS SPEECH HAD AN ODD TIMBRE THAT MADE THE HAIRS ON HIS NECK STAND ON END.

THERE WAS ALSO THE MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WHO HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP FROM THE LOWER DEPTHS OF THE FACTORY TO BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED MEMBER OF THE FEDERATION OF LABOUR. THERE HE FOUND A FORUM WHERE HE COULD SPEAK WITH AUTHORITY, STANDING IN FRONT OF HIS FULL ASSEMBLY. BUT HE WAS NOT PLEASED WITH HIMSELF. “WELL, THIS IS GOOD … BUT THIS IS NOT THE WAY I EXPECTED …” HE SAID TO ME, AS IF TO SAY THAT HE WERE BETRAYING THE FEDERATION OF LABOUR. “I’M A MEMBER OF THE FEDERATION OF LABOUR,” HE SAID, AS IF TO SAY THAT HE WAS PROUD OF HAVING FOUND A FORUM WHERE HE COULD SPEAK HIS MIND. BUT HIS MANNER CHANGED AT THAT MOMENT. HE STARED, HE BRUSQUELY HELD THE SHEET OF PAPER, HE WAS IRRITATED BECAUSE I WAS MAKING HIM LISTEN. FOR HIM IT WAS A STRUGGLE; HE WANTED TO TASTE THE FINE FROLIC OF DELIRIUM, THE BITTERSWEET ECSTASY OF DISABUSED INDULGENCE. AND AT THE SAME TIME HE WAS LEARNING THE SOBER TRUTH ABOUT THE DIFFICULTIES OF MILITANT COMMUNISM. THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER WAS THAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE MILITANT ASPECT OF IT, BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF BEING DECEIVED BY IT, ON THE CONTRARY, AND SO HE CHOSE THE CAPITALIST ASPECT. “IT’S A STRUGGLE,” HE TOLD ME, “IT’S A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE WORKERS AND THE CAPITALISTS.” HE REALIZED THAT UNDER THE BEST OF TIMES IT WAS THE WORKERS WHO WERE OPPRESSED, AND OVER THE BEST OF TIMES IT WAS THE CAPITALISTS WHO WERE THE OPPRESSORS. NOW THE WORKERS WERE THE OPPRESSORS AND THE CAPITALISTS THE OPPRESSED; THAT WAS THE GREAT DIVERGENCE.

THE ONLY BRIGHT SPOT IN THIS OTHERWISE DESICCATED FACE WAS THE LITTLE BLACK EYES OF SARTRE.    IT WAS DURING THOSE RAVENOUS HOURS IN NOVEMBER THAT SARTRE SEEMED MOST ALIVE, MOST HUMAN. AT THAT TIME HE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS CHEERFUL, BUT WHEN THE EVENING WAS NEW HE WAS FALTERING OR FALLING OVER HIMSELF. ONE EVENING, WHEN OLIVIER BLÉVIGNE WAS GIVING A LECTURE ON THE HISTORY OF THE FRENCH COMMUNISTS, HE SAID TO SARTRE, “YOU KNOW VERY WELL THAT THE WHOLE THING BEGAN WITH YOUR ENTRY INTO THE M.F.A. IN 1925.” “OH YES,” HE SAID, “YOU KNOW IT VERY WELL.” THE NEXT DAY BLÉVIGNE ASKED HIM, “WHAT DID IT BEGIN WITH?” SARTRE REPLIED, “NOTHING. IT WAS WITH THE BRETONS.” HE ATTRIBUTED THE DISAGREEMENT TO THE FACT THAT THE M.F.A. HAD NOT BEEN VERY KEEN ON THE ALGERIAN WAR. AND HE CONDEMNED THE FRENCH FOR THEIR “DISCIPLINE OF VIOLENCE.”

YET HIS HEALTH WAS NOT IMPROVING AND HE REALIZED IT. “I’M FAR FROM WELL.” HE SAID TO ME ON NOVEMBER 4. THE DAY BEFORE, WHEN HE WAS GOING FOR HIS INJECTION, HE HAD GONE TO SEE THE DOCTOR WITH MICHÈLE VIAN AND ARLETTELE BRIAND. HE HAD SWELLED HIS BLOOD—FROM 140 TO 200 MILLILITERS—FROM HIS LIVER AND IT HAD PUT HIM INTO A COMA. ZAIDMANN HAD SAID THAT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO PUT HIM INTO A STATE OF REMISSION, BUT IT WAS NOT TO BE HOPED. ANDRÉ HAD SAID TO HIM “TAKE CARE, BECAUSE MY LIVER IS NOT VERY GOOD

“I UNDERSTAND YOU. I UNDERSTOOD YOU THE DAY YOU WALKED INTO THE ROOM.”

“YES,” SHE SAYS, “ON THE SATURDAY BEFORE THE EASTER HOLIDAY, IN THE MAGAZINE.”

“WHICH ONE?”

“THE ONE YOU TOLD ME ABOUT.”

“YES, THE ONE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TOLD ME ABOUT.”

“OH, I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.”

“NO, BUT I TALKED ABOUT IT.”

I TELL HER ABOUT THE “OTHER SIDE.”

“THE OTHER ONE?” SHE SAYS IT WITH GENTLENESS.

“THE ONE WHERE THEY CUT YOUR LEGS OFF.”

“YES.”

“ONE TIME THEY LET YOU OUT OF A JAIL CELL AND TOOK YOU TO AN ARMCHAIR; THEY TOLD ME YOU WERE GOING TO BE TAKEN TO AN INSTITUTION FOR THE INSANE.”

“YES.”

“AND THEY GAVE YOU LEAVE TO GO AND WALK ABOUT.”

“YES.”

“ONE SUNDAY THEY CALLED ME; I WAS SICK AND TIRED AND I WANTED TO GO—I DIDN’T KNOW WHERE TO GO.”

“YES, AND THEY GAVE YOU LEAVE TO WALK ABOUT.”

“YES,” SHE SAYS, GENTLY; “THERE WAS A SUNDAY AND I WAS SICK AND TIRED AND I DIDN’T KNOW WHERE TO GO.”

“YES, AND THEY GAVE YOU LEAVE TO WALK ABOUT.”

“YES,” SHE SAYS, SMILING. “THERE WAS ALSO THE TIME I WAS GOING TO DIE AND THEY GAVE ME LEAVE TO DIE.”

“THAT’S TRUE,” SHE SAYS, “I WANTED TO DIE IN A HOSPITAL.”

“THAT’S TRUE,” I SAY.

“WELL, I’D BETTER GET ON WITH IT.”

I DON’T INSIST. AFTER ALL, SHE HAS HAD HER SHARE OF SETBACKS. BETWEEN THE SILENCES OF THE HOSPITAL AND THE SILENCES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, SHE KEEPS ON LIVING HER DESPICABLE LITTLE GAME.

“I HAVE BEEN SEEING PEOPLE. I’VE BEEN SEEING OLD PEOPLE. I USED TO SEE BABIES.”

“YES,” SHE SAYS WITH CONVICTION. “AND YOU WILL HAVE OLD PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.”

“AH, I’M GETTING TO IT,” I SAY, “I’M GETTING TO IT!”

“SO YOU SEE!”

“SEE WHAT?”

“YOU KNOW, THE OTHER DAY YOU TOLD ME . . .”

“YES, THE DOCTOR TOLD ME . . .”

“HE WANTED ME TO GO AND SEE A DOCTOR IN THE JEWISH QUARTER.”

“REALLY? THE DOCTOR IN THE JEWISH QUARTER?” SHE SAYS WITH CONVICTION. “ISN’T THAT FAR?”

“AH, THE DOCTOR WAS VERY FOND OF ME. HE HAD A SPECIALITY FOR ME, YOU KNOW.”

“REALLY?” SHE ASKS, WITH ASSURANCE. “WHAT WAS IT?”

“WELL, I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY LEGS. I WASN’T THINKING ABOUT MY LEGS, YOU KNOW.”

“REALLY?” SHE SAYS IN A TONELESS VOICE. “YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT MY LEGS.”

“YES,” SHE SAYS, “I WAS WORRIED ABOUT MY LEGS.”

“AH, YOU WERE JOKING, MY LOVE.”

“IT WASN’T FAR, MIND YOU.”

SHE HESITATES A SECOND TIME, WITH ASSURANCE. “OH, YOU MEAN YOU . . .”

“YES, I MEAN YOU . . .”

“WELL, I . . .” SHE SAYS WITH ASSURANCE. “I TOLD YOU ONCE,” SHE SAYS WITH A LAUGH. “YOU WEREN’T LISTENING.”

“YOU WERE JOKING, MY LOVE.”

“IT WAS FAR, MIND YOU.”

SHE HESITATES A SECOND TIME, WITH EMBARRASSMENT. “NO, I WASN’T LISTENING.”

SHE EATS THE MORSELIC, THEN HER FINGERS LINGER ON THE REGISTER. THE CORNERS OF HER MOUTH TREMBLE LIGHTLY.

“WELL, I . . .” SHE BEGINS TO LAUGH.

“I WAS THINKING OF . . .”

ONE MAN AND HIS FAMILY

SLEEP IN A BASEMENT CELL.

ANOTHER EXPLORES BAREFOOT

ON AN EMPTY BEACH.

AN OLD MAN WHO’S HAPPY

(AS ALL MEN ARE HAPPY NOW)

GETS UP EVERY MORNING.

PLACES SUCH AS THIS—

SCATTERED ABOUT IN YOUR DAY—

MAKE YOU THINK YOU COULD LIVE

IN A THOUSAND TINY VILLAGES,

FAR FROM A HOUSE

AND YOUR FAMILY. YOU FEEL

AWKWARD AND LONELY IN THE SAME

HOUSE, ALONE AND HUMAN,

AS YOU’VE NEVER BEEN.

THE OZONE LAYER
THE NEWS HAS BROKEN THAT THE

WORLD TRADE CENTER TOWERS ARE BEING REBUILT,

HIGH ON THE HUDSON, IN A BEAUTIFUL NEW

YARD. THE CITY HAS A DAY OFF,

A FEW CLOUDS

CAST SHADOWS OVER THE ATLANTIC

AND A NORTHERLY WIND

THAT BLOWS THE SOUPÇON OF HUDSON

INTO THE CANALS. ACROSS THE RIVER,

THE HERDS OF RAVENS HAVE COME

TO MEET THE DRAINS AND REBUILD

THE BRIDGES. MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

I’VE EVER WANTED TO DO, EXCEPT

TO LAY DOWN FOR A FEW HOURS

ONE NIGHT AND RECOVER. I DON’T

HAVE A BODY, A MIND,

OR A PHONE TO REMIND ME OTHERWISE.

LOUISE
THE OZONE LAYER

HAS BEEN LOSING ITS

STRENGTH,

LEAVING THE BIRDS

CONFUSED AND FRIGHTENED.

YOU, WHO’D JUST MADE

A NEW FRIEND, ARE IN NO HURRY.

A FEW DAYS AFTER

THIS MESS, YOU CALL

TO SAY YOU’VE CHANGED

YOUR LIFE. YOU WANT

TO RUN WITH IT, AND IN

THE CONFUSION, MAKE

ONE TINY MOVE

THAT’S RIGHT FOR THE THRILL

OF IT. A FEW YEARS

LATER, YOU FIND YOURSELF

ATTENDING THE FUNERAL PROCESSION

OF A FRIEND YOU BARELY KNEW.

YOU’RE NOT SAD,

YOU SAY, “JUST TIRED.”

AND IT’S TRUE, JUST TIRED.

YOUR LIFE SUCKS, LOUIS, IT

DOES. AND SOMEBODY HAS JUST TOLD

ME WHY.

THE HAT
WALKING THROUGH THE THRONGS

OF THE HAT-BEARING

MASSES THIS PAST WEEKEND,

I WAS STRUCK BY THE HAT-DROPPING,

EVEN BEFORE THE THRONG ENTERS.

YOU ARE ARRESTED, YOU AND YOUR

FRIENDS WHO THROW THEIR HATS

IN THE AIR, YOU AND YOUR

FAMILY WHO HAS TO GO THROUGH

ITS OWN REEKING AND SHABBY

RECEIPTS. YOU ARE A HARD-LINER,

SOME SAY YOU ARE SOFT-SPOKEN,

SOME SAY YOU ARE BRILLIANT.

WHO ARE YOU KIDDING? NONE OF THAT MAKES YOU

LESS TRUE, LOUIS. YOU ARE

JUST AS DRUNK, IF NOT MORE SO,

WHEN IT COMES TO THE LITTLE

THINGS THAT MAKE YOU UNHAPPY.

THE HAT
THIS PAST WEEKEND THE POLICE GAVE

MY DAUGHTER, WHO’D JUST TURNED TWENTY,

A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY

IN THE PARKING LOT. SHE TOLD ME

LATER THAT IT HELPED HER DEAL

WITH THE STRESS OF HER NEW LIFE.

WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

I DON’T KNOW, MAYBE THAT’S IT.

THE WEATHER MAN
WHAT THE HELL! I DON’T

KNOW, LOUIS, I DON’T

WISH IT, I DON’T

CARE. THE MAN IS OUT THERE

UNDER THE BLANKET,

UNDER THE DUVET, DOING HIS BEST

TO BRIGHTEN OUR HOURS.

WE CALL HIM THE GHOST OF EMMIT

THE WEATHER MAN. IN GERMAN

HE CALLS HIMSELF

“THE KING OF THE JEWS.” IN ENGLISH

HE CALLS HIMSELF

“THE GERMAN JESUS.” IN BOTH CASES

HE IS JÖDZ. WHICH IS TO SAY

THAT HE IS A THORN IN THE FLESH,

A THORN IN THE HEART, A THORN

IN YOUR HEART, AND A THORN

IN MY OWN HEART.

THE GERMAN JESUS
THE OLD SPANISH INQUISITION

HAS FLED TO THE CORNERS OF THE WORLD,

WHERE IT HAS BECOME LEGEND.

IT IS ON A LEASH, THE GERMAN JESUS.

—EMERSON

I HAVE KNOWN ATHEISM AND FAITH,

FAITH AND ATHEISM, THE ONE

A DOGMATIC CERTAINTY, THE OTHER

A FAITH WITH NO LEASH.

ONCE I WAS A CHRISTIAN,

THEN A JEW, THEN A MUSLIM,

AND FINALLY AN ATHEIST.





STORM WARNINGS

THE GLASS HAS BEEN FALLING ALL THE AFTERNOON,

AND KNOWING BETTER THAN THE INSTRUMENT

WHAT WINDS ARE WALKING OVERHEAD, WHAT ZONE

OF GRAY UNREST IS MOVING ACROSS THE LAND,

I LEAVE THE BOOK UPON A PILLOWED CHAIR

AND WALK FROM WINDOW TO CLOSED WINDOW, WATCHING

BOUGHS STRAIN AGAINST THE SKY

AND THINK AGAIN, AS OFTEN WHEN THE AIR

MOVES INWARD TOWARD A SILENT CORE OF WAITING,

HOW WITH A SINGLE PURPOSE TIME HAS TRAVELED

BY SECRET CURRENTS OF THE UNDISCERNED

INTO THIS POLAR REALM. WEATHER ABROAD

AND WEATHER IN THE HEART ALIKE COME ON

REGARDLESS OF PREDICTION.

BETWEEN FORESEEING AND AVERTING CHANGE

LIES ALL THE MASTERY OF ELEMENTS

WHICH CLOCKS AND WEATHERGLASSES CANNOT ALTER.

TIME IN THE HAND IS NOT CONTROL OF TIME,

NOR SHATTERED FRAGMENTS OF AN INSTRUMENT

A PROOF AGAINST THE WIND; THE WIND WILL RISE,

WE CAN ONLY CLOSE THE SHUTTERS.

I DRAW THE CURTAINS AS THE SKY GOES BLACK

AND SET A MATCH TO CANDLES SHEATHED IN GLASS

AGAINST THE KEYHOLE DRAUGHT, THE INSISTENT WHINE

OF WEATHER THROUGH THE UNSEALED APERTURE.

THIS IS OUR SOLE DEFENSE AGAINST THE SEASON;

THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED TO DO

WHO LIVE IN TROUBLED REGIONS.

AUNT JENNIFER’S TIGERS

AUNT JENNIFER’S TIGERS PRANCE ACROSS A SCREEN,

BRIGHT TOPAZ DENIZENS OF A WORLD OF GREEN.

THEY DO NOT FEAR THE MEN BENEATH THE TREE;

THEY PACE IN SLEEK CHIVALRIC CERTAINTY.

AUNT JENNIFER’S FINGERS FLUTTERING THROUGH HER WOOL

FIND EVEN THE IVORY NEEDLE HARD TO PULL.

THE MASSIVE WEIGHT OF UNCLE’S WEDDING BAND

SITS HEAVILY UPON AUNT JENNIFER’S HAND.

WHEN AUNT IS DEAD, HER TERRIFIED HANDS WILL LIE

STILL RINGED WITH ORDEALS SHE WAS MASTERED BY.

THE TIGERS IN THE PANEL THAT SHE MADE

WILL GO ON PRANCING, PROUD AND UNAFRAID.

VERTIGO

AS FOR ME, I DISTRUST THE COMMONPLACE;

DEMAND AND AM RECEIVING MARVELS, SIGNS,

MIRACLES WROUGHT IN AIR, ACTED IN SPACE

AFTER IMAGINATION’S OWN DESIGNS.

THE LION AND THE TIGER PACE THIS WAY

AS OFTEN AS I CALL; THE FLIGHT OF WINGS

SURPRISES EMPTY AIR, WHILE OUT OF CLAY

THE GOLDEN-GOURDED VINE UNWATERED SPRINGS.

I HAVE INHALED IMPOSSIBILITY,

AND WALK AT SUCH AN ANGLE, ALL THE STARS

HAVE HUNG THEIR CARNIVAL CHAINS OF LIGHT FOR ME:

THERE IS A STREETCAR RUNS FROM HERE TO MARS.

I SHALL BE SEEING YOU, MY DARLING, THERE,

OR AT THE BURNING BUSH IN HARVARD SQUARE.

THE ULTIMATE ACT

WHAT IF THE WORLD’S CORRUPTION NEARS,

THE CONSEQUENCE THEY DARE NOT NAME?

WE SHALL BUT REALIZE OUR FEARS

AND HAVING TASTED THEM GO ON,

NEITHER FROM HOPE OF GRACE NOR FAME,

DELIVERED FROM REMORSE AND SHAME,

AND DO THE THINGS LEFT TO BE DONE

FOR NO SAKE OTHER THAN THEIR OWN.

THE QUARRY SHALL BE STALKED AND WON,

THE BED INVADED, AND THE GAME

PLAYED TILL THE ROOF COMES TUMBLING DOWN

AND WIN OR LOSE ARE ALL THE SAME.

ACTION AT SUCH A PITCH SHALL FLAME

ONLY BENEATH A FINAL SUN.

WHAT GHOSTS CAN SAY

WHEN HARRY WYLIE SAW HIS FATHER’S GHOST,

AS BEARDED AND IMMENSE AS ONCE IN LIFE,

BENDING ABOVE HIS BED LONG AFTER MIDNIGHT,

HE SCREAMED AND GRIPPED THE CORNER OF THE PILLOW

TILL AUNTS CAME HURRYING WHITE IN DRESSING GOWNS

TO SAY IT WAS A DREAM. HE KNEW THEY LIED.

THE SMELL OF HIS FATHER’S LEATHER RIDING CROP

AND STALE TOBACCO STAYED TO PROVE IT TO HIM.

WHY SHOULD THERE STAY SUCH TOKENS OF A GHOST

IF NOT TO PROVE IT CAME ON SERIOUS BUSINESS?

HIS FATHER ALWAYS HAD MEANT SERIOUS BUSINESS,

BUT NEVER SO WHOLLY IN HIS LOOK AND GESTURE

AS WHEN HE BEAT THE BOY’S UNCOVERED THIGHS

CALMLY AND RESOLUTELY, AT AN HOUR

WHEN HARRY NEVER HAD BEEN AWAKE BEFORE.

THE MAN WHO COULD CHOOSE THAT SINGLE HOUR OF NIGHT

HAD IN HIM THE INGREDIENTS OF A GHOST;

MORTALITY WOULD QUAIL AT SUCH A MAN.

AN OLDER HARRY LOST HIS CHILDISH NOTION

AND ONLY SOMETIMES WONDERED IF EVENTS

COULD ECHO THUS LONG AFTER IN A DREAM.

IF SO, IT SURELY MEANT THEY HAD A MEANING.

BUT WHY THE ACTUAL PUNISHMENT HAD FALLEN,

FOR WHAT OFFENSE OF BOYHOOD, HE COULD TRY

FOR YEARS AND NOT UNEARTH. WHAT GHOSTS CAN SAY—

EVEN THE GHOSTS OF FATHERS—COMES OBSCURELY.

WHAT IF THE TERROR STAYS WITHOUT THE MEANING?

THE KURSAAL AT INTERLAKEN

HERE AMONG TABLES LIT WITH BOTTLED TAPERS

THE VIOLINS ARE TUNING FOR THE EVENING

AGAINST THE MEASURED “FAITES VOS JEUX,” THE MURMUR,

RISING AND FALLING, FROM THE GAMING ROOMS.

THE WAITERS SKIM BENEATH THE ORNATE RAFTERS

WHERE LANTERNS SWING LIKE TISSUE-PAPER BUBBLES.

THE TABLES FILL, THE BOTTLED CANDLES DRIP,

THE GAMING WHEELS SPIN IN THE LONG SALON,

AND OPERETTA WALTZES GILD THE AIR

WITH THE CAPRICIOUS LILT OF COSTUME MUSIC.

YOU WILL PERHAPS MAKE LOVE TO ME THIS EVENING,

DANCING AMONG THE CIRCULAR GREEN TABLES

OR WHERE THE CLOCKWORK TINKLE OF THE FOUNTAIN

SOUNDS IN THE GARDEN’S PRIMLY PEBBLED ARBORS.

REALITY IS NO STRONGER THAN A WALTZ,

A PAINTED LAKE STIPPLED WITH BOATS AND SWANS,

A GLASS OF GOLD-BROWN BEER, A PHRASE IN GERMAN

OR FRENCH, OR ANY LANGUAGE BUT OUR OWN.

REALITY WOULD CALL US LESS THAN FRIENDS,

AND THEREFORE MORE ADEPT AT MAKING LOVE.

WHAT IS THE WORLD, THE VIOLINS SEEM TO SAY,

BUT WINDOWS FULL OF BEARS AND MUSIC BOXES,

CHOCOLATE GNOMES AND WATER-COLOR MOUNTAINS,

AND CALENDARS OF FRENCH AND GERMAN DAYS—

SONNTAG AND VENDREDI, UNREAL DIMENSIONS,

DAYS WHERE WE SPEAK ALL LANGUAGES BUT OUR OWN?

SO IN THIS EVENING OF A MYTHICAL SUMMER

WE SHALL BELIEVE ALL FLOWERS ARE EDELWEISS,

ALL BEARS HAND-CARVED, ALL KISSES OUT OF TIME,

CAUGHT IN THE SPINNING VERTIGO OF A WALTZ.

THE FRINGE OF FOAM CLINGS LACELIKE TO YOUR GLASS,

AND NOW THAT MIDNIGHT DRAWS WITH SWISS PERFECTION

THE CLOCK’S TWO HANDS INTO A SINGLE GESTURE,

SHALL WE PURSUE THIS MOOD INTO THE NIGHT,

PLAY THIS CHARADE OUT IN THE SILVER STREET

WHERE MOONLIGHT POURS A THEME BY BERLIOZ?

IF FAR FROM BREATH OF OURS, INDIFFERENT, FROZEN,

THE MOUNTAIN LIKE A SWORD AGAINST THE NIGHT

CATCHES A COLDER SILVER, DRAWS OUR SIGHT,

WHAT IS SHE BUT A LOCAL TOUR DE FORCE?

THE AIR IS BRIGHT WITH AFTER-IMAGES.

THE LANTERNS AND THE TWINKLING GLASSES DWINDLE,

THE WALTZES AND THE CROUPIERS’ VOICES CRUMBLE,

THE EVENING FOLDS LIKE A KALEIDOSCOPE.

AGAINST THE SPLINTERS OF A REELING LANDSCAPE

THIS IMAGE STILL PURSUES US INTO TIME:

JUNGFRAU, THE LEGENDARY VIRGIN SPIRE,

CONSUMES THE MIND WITH MINGLED SNOW AND FIRE.

RELIQUARY

THE BONES OF SAINTS ARE PRAISED ABOVE THEIR FLESH,

THAT PALE REJECTED GARMENT OF THEIR LIVES

IN WHICH THEY WALKED DESPISED, UNCANONIZED.

BROODING UPON THE MARBLE BONES OF TIME

MEN READ STRANGE SANCTITY IN LOST EVENTS,

HOLD REQUIEM MASS FOR MURDERED YESTERDAYS,

AND IN THE DUST OF ACTIONS ONCE REVILED

FIND SYMBOLS TRACED, AND FREEZE THEM INTO STONE.

PURELY LOCAL

BESIDE THIS DOOR A JANUARY TREE

ANSWERS A FEW DAYS’ WARMTH WITH SHOOTS OF GREEN;

AND KNOWING WHAT THE WINDS MUST DO, I SEE

A HINT OF SOMETHING HUMAN IN THE SCENE.

NO MATTER HOW THE ALMANACS HAVE SAID

HOLD BACK, DISTRUST A PURELY LOCAL MAY,

WHEN DID WE EVER LEARN TO BE AFRAID?

WHY ARE WE SCARRED WITH WINTER’S THRUST TODAY?

A VIEW OF THE TERRACE

UNDER THE GREEN UMBRELLAS

DRINKING GOLDEN TEA,

THERE SIT THE PORCELAIN PEOPLE

WHO CARE FOR YOU BUT LITTLE

AND NOT AT ALL FOR ME.

THE AFTERNOON IN CRINKLES

LIES STIFFLY ON THE LAWN

AND WE, TWO FURTIVE EXILES,

WATCH FROM AN UPPER WINDOW

WITH SHUTTERS NOT QUITE DRAWN.

THE GILT AND SCALLOPED LAUGHTER

REACHES US THROUGH A GLAZE,

AND ALMOST WE IMAGINE

THAT IF WE THREW A PEBBLE

THE SHINING SCENE WOULD CRAZE.

BUT STONES ARE THROWN BY CHILDREN,

AND WE BY NOW TOO WISE

TO TRY AGAIN TO SPLINTER

THE BRIGHT ENAMEL PEOPLE

IMPERVIOUS TO SURPRISE.

BY NO MEANS NATIVE

“YONDER,” THEY TOLD HIM, “THINGS ARE NOT THE SAME.”

HE FOUND IT UNDERSTATED WHEN HE CAME.

HIS TONGUE, IN HOPES TO FIND ITSELF AT HOME,

CAUGHT UP THE TWIST OF EVERY IDIOM.

HE LEARNED THE ACCENT AND THE TURN OF PHRASE,

STUDIED LIKE LATIN TEXTS THE LOCAL WAYS.

HE TASTED TILL HIS PALATE KNEW THEIR SHAPE

THE COUNTRY’S PROUDEST BEAN, ITS MASTER GRAPE.

HE NEVER TALKED OF FIELDS REMEMBERED GREEN,

OR SEASONS IN HIS LAND OF ORIGIN.

AND STILL HE FELT THERE LAY A BRIDGELESS SPACE

BETWEEN HIMSELF AND NATIVES OF THE PLACE.

THEIR LAUGHTER CAME WHEN HIS HAD LONG ABATED;

HE STRUGGLED IN ALLUSIONS NEVER STATED.

THE TRUTH AT LAST CRIED OUT TO BE CONFESSED:

HE MUST REMAIN ETERNALLY A GUEST,

NEVER TO WEAR THE BIRTHMARK OF THEIR WAYS.

HE COULD BE STUDYING NATIVE ALL HIS DAYS

AND DIE A KIND OF MINOR ALIEN STILL.

HE MIGHT DECEIVE HIMSELF BY FORCE OF WILL,

FEEL ALL THE SENTIMENTS AND GIVE THE SIGN,

YET NEVER OVERSTEP THAT TENUOUS LINE.

WHAT ELSE THEN? WEAR THE OLD IDENTITY,

THE MARK OF OTHER BIRTH, AND WHEN YOU DIE,

DIE AS AN EXILE? IT HAS DONE FOR SOME.

OTHERS SURRENDER, BOOK THEIR PASSAGE HOME,

ONLY TO SEEK THEIR EXILE SOON AGAIN,

NO GREATER STRANGERS THAN THEIR COUNTRYMEN.

YET MAN WILL HAVE HIS BONDAGE TO SOME PLACE;

IF NOT, HE SEEKS AN ORDER, OR A RACE.

SOME JOIN THE MASONS, SOME EMBRACE THE CHURCH,

AND IF THEY DO, IT DOES NOT MATTER MUCH.

AS FOR HIMSELF, HE JOINED THE BAND OF THOSE

WHO PICK THEIR FRUIT NO MATTER WHERE IT GROWS,

AND LEARN TO LIKE IT SWEET OR LIKE IT SOUR

DEPENDING ON THE ORCHARD OR THE HOUR.

BY NO MEANS NATIVE, YET SOMEWHAT IN LOVE

WITH THINGS A NATIVE IS ENAMORED OF—

EXCEPT THE SENSE OF BEING HELD AND OWNED

BY ONE ANCESTRAL PATCH OF LOCAL GROUND.

AIR WITHOUT INCENSE

WE EAT THIS BODY AND REMAIN OURSELVES.

WE DRINK THIS LIQUOR, TASTING WINE, NOT BLOOD.

AMONG THESE TRIPLE ICONS, RITES OF SEVEN,

WE KNOW THE FEAST TO BE OF EARTH, NOT HEAVEN:

HERE MAN IS WOUNDED, YET WE SPEAK OF GOD.

MORE THAN THE NAZARENE WITH HIM WAS LAID

INTO THE TOMB, AND IN THE TOMB HAS STAYED.

COMMUNION OF NO SAINTS, MASS WITHOUT BELL,

AIR WITHOUT INCENSE, WE IMPLORE AT NEED.

THERE ARE QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED, AND THE SKY

ANSWERS NO QUESTIONS, HEARS NO LITANY.

WE BREATHE THE VAPORS OF A SICKENED CREED.

OURS ARE ASSASSINS DEADLIER THAN SIN;

DEEPER DISORDERS STARVE THE SOUL WITHIN.

IF ANY WRIT COULD TELL US, WE WOULD READ.

IF ANY GHOST DARED LAY ON US A CLAIM,

OUR FIBERS WOULD RESPOND, OUR NERVES OBEY;

BUT REVELATION MOVES APART TODAY

FROM GESTURES OF A TIRED PONTIFICAL GAME.

WE SEEK, WHERE LAMP AND KYRIE EXPIRE,

A SITE UNSCOURGED BY WASTING TONGUES OF FIRE.

FOR THE FELLING OF AN ELM IN THE HARVARD YARD

THEY SAY THE GROUND PRECISELY SWEPT

NO LONGER FEEDS WITH RICH DECAY

THE ROOTS ENORMOUS IN THEIR AGE

THAT LONG AND DEEP BENEATH HAVE SLEPT.

SO THE GREAT SPIRE IS OVERTHROWN,

AND SHARP SAWS HAVE GONE HURTLING THROUGH

THE RINGS THAT THREE SLOW CENTURIES WORE;

THE SECOND OLDEST ELM IS DOWN.

THE SHADE WHERE JAMES AND WHITEHEAD STROLLED

BECOMES A LITTER ON THE GREEN.

THE YOUNG MEN PAUSE ALONG THE PATHS

TO SEE THE AXES GLINTING BOLD.

WATCHING THE HEWN TRUNK DRAGGED AWAY,

SOME TURN THE SYMBOL TO THEIR OWN,

AND SOME ADMIRE THE CLEAN DISPATCH

WITH WHICH THE AGED ELM CAME DOWN.

A CLOCK IN THE SQUARE

THIS HANDLESS CLOCK STARES BLINDLY FROM ITS TOWER,

REFUSING TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY HOUR.

BUT WHAT CAN ONE CLOCK DO TO STOP THE GAME

WHEN OTHERS GO ON STRIKING JUST THE SAME?

WHATEVER MITE OF TRUTH THE GESTURE HELD,

TIME MAY BE SILENCED BUT WILL NOT BE STILLED,

NOR WE ABSOLVED BY ANY ONE’S WITHDRAWING

FROM ALL THE RESTLESS WAYS WE MUST BE GOING

AND ALL THE RINGS IN WHICH WE’RE SPUN AND SWIRLED,

WHETHER AROUND A CLOCKFACE OR A WORLD.

WHY ELSE BUT TO FORESTALL THIS HOUR

WHY ELSE BUT TO FORESTALL THIS HOUR, I STAYED

OUT OF THE NOONDAY SUN, KEPT FROM THE RAIN,

SWAM ONLY IN FAMILIAR DEPTHS, AND PLAYED

NO HAND WHERE CAUTION SIGNALED TO REFRAIN?

FOR FOURTEEN FRIENDS I WALKED BEHIND THE BIER;

A SCORE OF COUSINS WILTED IN MY SIGHT.

I HEARD THE STEEPLES CLANG FOR EACH NEW YEAR,

THEN DREW MY SHUTTERS CLOSE AGAINST THE NIGHT.

BANKRUPTCY FELL ON OTHERS LIKE A DEW;

SPENDTHRIFTS OF LIFE, THEY ALL SUCCUMBED AND FLED.

I DID NOT CHIDE THEM WITH THE THINGS I KNEW:

SMILING, I PASSED THE ALMSHOUSE OF THE DEAD.

I AM THE MAN WHO HAS OUTMISERED DEATH,

IN PAINS AND CUNNING LAID MY SEASONS BY.

NOW I MUST TOIL TO WIN EACH HOUR AND BREATH;

I AM TOO FULL OF YEARS TO REASON WHY.

THIS BEAST, THIS ANGEL

NO: THIS, MY LOVE, IS NEITHER YOU NOR I.

THIS IS THE BEAST OR ANGEL, CHANGING FORM,

THE WILL THAT WE ARE SCOURGED AND NOURISHED BY.

THE GOLDEN FANGS, THE TALL SERAPHIC SWORD,

ALIKE UNSHEATHED, AWAIT THE MIDNIGHT CRY,

BLAZON THEIR ANSWER TO THE STAMMERED WORD.

BENEATH THIS GAZE OUR POWERS ARE FUSED AS ONE;

WE MEET THESE EYES UNDER THE CURVE OF NIGHT.

THIS IS THE TRANSFORMATION THAT IS DONE

WHERE MORTAL FORCES SLAY MORTALITY

AND, TOWERING AT TERRIBLE FULL HEIGHT,

THIS BEAST, THIS ANGEL IS BOTH YOU AND I.

EASTPORT TO BLOCK ISLAND

ALONG THE COASTAL WATERS, SIGNALS RUN

IN WAVES OF CAUTION AND ANXIETY.

WE’LL TRY THE CATBOAT OUT ANOTHER DAY.

SO DANNY STANDS IN SEA-GRASS BY THE PORCH

TO WATCH A HEELING DINGHY, LONE ON GREY,

GRAPPLE WITH MOODS OF WIND THAT TAKE THE BAY.

ONE YEAR WE WALKED AMONG THE SHIPWRECKED SHINGLES

OF STORM-CRAZED COTTAGES ALONG THE DUNE.

ROSA MORELLI FOUND HER HUSBAND’S BOAT

RUINED ON THE ROCKS; SHE NEVER SAW HIM DEAD,

AND AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF STUBBORN HOPE

BEGAN TO CURSE THE SIGHT OF THINGS AFLOAT.

THE MOTHER OF THE KENNEDY BOYS IS OUT

STRIPPING THE MONDAY BURDEN FROM THE LINE

AND LOOKING FOR A ROWBOAT ROUND THE HEADLAND.

WONDER IF THEY STOPPED FOR BAIT AT MORY’S

AND IF THE OLD MAN MADE THEM UNDERSTAND

THIS IS A DAY FOR BOYS TO STAY ON LAND?

SMALL CRAFT, SMALL CRAFT, STAY IN AND WAIT FOR TIDINGS.

THE WORD COMES IN WITH EVERY HOUR OF WIND.

NEWS OF A LOCAL VIOLENCE PRICKS THE AIR,

AND WE WHO HAVE SEEN THE KITCHEN BLOWN AWAY,

OR HARPER’S CHILDREN WASHED FROM SIGHT, PREPARE

AS USUAL IN THESE PARTS FOR FOUL, NOT FAIR.

AT A DEATHBED IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND

I BID YOU CAST OUT PITY.

NO MORE OF THAT: LET BE

IMPOTENT GRIEF AND MOURNING.

HOW SHALL A MAN BREAK FREE

FROM THIS DEATHWATCH OF EARTH,

THIS WORLD ESTRANGED FROM MIRTH?

SHOW ME GAY FACES ONLY.

I CALL FOR PRIDE AND WIT—

MEN WHO REMEMBER LAUGHTER,

BRAVE JESTERS TO BEFIT

AN AGE THAT WOULD DESTROY

ITS LAST OUTPOST OF JOY.

NO LONGER CONDOLENCE

AND WAILING ON THE TONGUE.

AN OLD MAN BIDS YOU LAUGH;

THIS TEXT I LEAVE THE YOUNG:

YOUR RAGE AND LOUD DESPAIR

BUT SHAKE A CRUMBLING STAIR.

LAUGHTER IS WHAT MEN LEARN

AT SEVENTY YEARS OR MORE,

WEARY OF BEING STERN

OR VIOLENT AS BEFORE.

LAUGHTER TO US IS LEFT

TO LIGHT THAT DARKENING RIFT

WHERE LITTLE TIME IS WITH US,

LET US ENACT AGAIN

NOT OEDIPUS BUT THE CLOUDS.

SUMMON THE PLAYERS IN.

BE PROUD ON A SORRY EARTH:

BRING ON THE MEN OF MIRTH.

AFTERWARD

NOW THAT YOUR HOPES ARE SHAMED, YOU STAND

AT LAST BELIEVING AND RESIGNED,

AND NONE OF US WHO TOUCH YOUR HAND

KNOW HOW TO GIVE YOU BACK IN KIND

THE WORDS YOU FLUNG WHEN HOPES WERE PROUD:

BEING BORN TO HAPPINESS

ABOVE THE ASKING OF THE CROWD,

YOU WOULD NOT TAKE A FINGER LESS.

WE WHO KNOW LIMITS NOW GIVE ROOM

TO ONE WHO GROWS TO FIT HER DOOM.

THE UNCLE SPEAKS IN THE DRAWING ROOM

I HAVE SEEN THE MOB OF LATE

STANDING SULLEN IN THE SQUARE,

GAZING WITH A SULLEN STARE

AT WINDOW, BALCONY, AND GATE.

SOME HAVE TALKED IN BITTER TONES,

SOME HAVE HELD AND FINGERED STONES.

THESE ARE FOLLIES THAT SUBSIDE.

LET US CONSIDER, NONE THE LESS,

CERTAIN FRAILTIES OF GLASS

WHICH, IT CANNOT BE DENIED,

LEAD IN TIMES LIKE THESE TO FEAR

FOR CRYSTAL VASE AND CHANDELIER.

NOT THAT MISSILES WILL BE CAST;

NONE AS YET DARE LIFT AN ARM.

BUT THE SCENE RECALLS A STORM

WHEN OUR GRANDSIRE STOOD AGHAST

TO SEE HIS ANTIQUE RUBY BOWL

SHIVERED IN A THUNDER-ROLL.

LET US ONLY BEAR IN MIND

HOW THESE TREASURES HANDED DOWN

FROM A CALMER AGE PASSED ON

ARE IN THE KEEPING OF OUR KIND.

WE STAND BETWEEN THE DEAD GLASS-BLOWERS

AND MURMURINGS OF MISSILE-THROWERS.

BOUNDARY

WHAT HAS HAPPENED HERE WILL DO

TO BITE THE LIVING WORLD IN TWO,

HALF FOR ME AND HALF FOR YOU.

HERE AT LAST I FIX A LINE

SEVERING THE WORLD’S DESIGN

TOO SMALL TO HOLD BOTH YOURS AND MINE.

THERE’S ENORMITY IN A HAIR

ENOUGH TO LEAD MEN NOT TO SHARE

NARROW CONFINES OF A SPHERE

BUT PUT AN OCEAN OR A FENCE

BETWEEN TWO OPPOSITE INTENTS.

A HAIR WOULD SPAN THE DIFFERENCE.

FIVE O’CLOCK, BEACON HILL

CURTIS AND I SIT DRINKING AUBURN SHERRY

IN THE RECEPTIVE TWILIGHT OF THE VINES

AND POTTED EXILE SHRUBS WITH SENSITIVE SPINES

GREENING THE GLASS OF THE CONSERVATORY.

CURTIS, IN SAND-GREY COAT AND TIE OF MADDER,

MEETS ELDER VALUES WITH POLITE NEGATION.

I, BETWEEN YEW AND LILY, IN RESIGNATION

WATCH LIME-GREEN SHADE ACROSS HIS LEFT CHEEK SPATTER.

GAZING BEYOND MY ELBOW, HE ALLOWS

SIGNIFICANCE OF SORTS TO BAUDELAIRE.

HIS PHRASES FLOAT ACROSS THE LUCENT AIR

LIKE EXOTIC LEAVES DETACHED FROM WAXY BOUGHS.

I DRINK OLD SHERRY AND LOOK AT CURTIS’ NOSE—

INTELLIGENT PURITAN FEATURE, GRAVE, DISCREET,

UNQUESTIONABLY A NOSE THAT ONE MIGHT MEET

IN PORTRAITS OF ANTIQUE GENERALISSIMOS.

THE STUDY SEEMS SUFFICIENT RECOMPENSE

FOR CURTIS’ DISSERTATIONS UPON GIDE.

WHAT REBEL BREATHES BENEATH HIS MASK, INDEED?

AVANT-GARDE IN TRADITION’S LINEAMENTS!

FROM A CHAPTER ON LITERATURE

AFTER THE SUNLIGHT AND THE FIERY VISION

LEADING US TO A PLACE OF RUNNING WATER,

WE CAME INTO A PLACE BY WATER ALTERED.

DEW RIBBONED FROM THOSE TREES, THE GRASSES WEPT

AND DROWNED IN THEIR OWN WEEPING; VACANT MIST

CRAWLED LIKE A SNAIL ACROSS THE LAND, AND LEFT

A SNAIL’S MOIST TRACE; AND EVERYTHING THERE THRIVING

STARED THROUGH AN AQUEOUS HALF-LIGHT, WITHOUT MIRTH

AND BRED BY LANGUID CYCLES, WITHOUT ARDOR.

THERE PASSION MILDEWED AND CORRUPTED SLOWLY,

TILL, FEEDING HOURLY ON ITS OWN CORRUPTION,

IT HAD FORGOTTEN FIRE AND ASPIRATION,

BECOMING SODDEN WITH APPETITE ALONE.

THERE IN THE GREEN-GREY THICKNESS OF THE AIR

LIVED AND BEGAT COLD SPORES OF INTELLECT,

TILL GIANT MOSSES OF A RIMELIKE ASPECT

HUNG HEAVILY FROM THE BOUGHS TO TESTIFY

AGAINST ALL SIMPLE SENSUALITIES,

TURNING THEM BY A TOUCH GROSS AND DISCOLORED,

SWELLING THE WARM TAUT FLESH TO BLOATED SYMBOL

BY UNRELENTING WATERY PERMEATIONS.

SO FROM PROMETHEAN HOPES WE CAME THIS FAR,

THIS FAR FROM LANDS OF SUN AND RACING BLOOD.

BEHIND US LAY THE BLAZING APPLE TREE,

BEHIND US TOO THE VULTURE AND THE ROCK—

THE TRAGIC LABOR AND THE HEROIC DOOM—

FOR WITHOUT PASSION THE ROCK ALSO CRUMBLES

AND THE WET TWILIGHT SCARES THE BIRD AWAY.

AN UNSAID WORD

SHE WHO HAS POWER TO CALL HER MAN

FROM THAT ESTRANGED INTENSITY

WHERE HIS MIND FORAGES ALONE,

YET KEEPS HER PEACE AND LEAVES HIM FREE,

AND WHEN HIS THOUGHTS TO HER RETURN

STANDS WHERE HE LEFT HER, STILL HIS OWN,

KNOWS THIS THE HARDEST THING TO LEARN.

MATHILDE IN NORMANDY

FROM THE ARCHAIC SHIPS THE GREEN AND RED

INVADERS WOVEN IN THEIR COLORED HOSTS

DESCEND TO CONQUER. HERE IS THE THREADED HEADLAND,

THE WARP AND WOOF OF A TIDELESS BEACH, THE FLIGHT,

RECOUNTED BY SLOW SHUTTLES, OF SWIFT ARROWS,

AND THE OUTLANDISH ATTITUDES OF DEATH

IN THE STITCHED SOLDIERY. THAT THIS SHOULD PROVE

MORE THAN THE PERSONAL EPISODE, MORE THAN ALL

THE LITTLE LIVES SKETCHED ON THE TEEMING LOOM

WAS THEN WITHHELD FROM YOU; SELF-CONSCIOUS HISTORY

THAT WRITES DELIBERATE FOOTNOTES TO ITS ACTION

WAS NOT OF YOUR YOUNG EPOCH. FOR A PASTIME

THE PATIENT HANDIWORK OF LONG-SLEEVED LADIES

WAS ESTEEMED PROPER WHEN THEIR LORDS ABANDONED

THE FIELDS AND APPLE TREES OF NORMANDY

FOR HARSHER HUNTING ON THE OPPOSITE COAST.

YOURS WAS A TIME WHEN WOMEN SAT AT HOME

TO THE PLEASING MINOR AIRS OF LUTE AND HAUTBOIS,

WHILE THE BRIGHT SUN ON THE EXPENSIVE THREADS

GLOWED IN THE LONG WINDLESS AFTERNOONS.

SAY WHAT YOU WILL, ANXIETY THERE TOO

PLAYED HAVOC WITH THE SKEIN, AND THE KNOTS CAME

WHEN FINGERS’ OCCUPATION AND MIND’S ATTENTION

GREW TOO DIVERGENT, AT THE KEEN REMEMBRANCE

OF WOODEN SHIPS PUTTING OUT FROM A LONG BEACH,

AND THE GREY OCEAN DIMMING TO A VOID,

AND THE SICK STRAINED FAREWELLS, TOO SHARP FOR SPEECH.

AT A BACH CONCERT

COMING BY EVENING THROUGH THE WINTRY CITY

WE SAID THAT ART IS OUT OF LOVE WITH LIFE.

HERE WE APPROACH A LOVE THAT IS NOT PITY.

THIS ANTIQUE DISCIPLINE, TENDERLY SEVERE,

RENEWS BELIEF IN LOVE YET MASTERS FEELING,

ASKING OF US A GRACE IN WHAT WE BEAR.

FORM IS THE ULTIMATE GIFT THAT LOVE CAN OFFER—

THE VITAL UNION OF NECESSITY

WITH ALL THAT WE DESIRE, ALL THAT WE SUFFER.

A TOO-COMPASSIONATE ART IS HALF AN ART.

ONLY SUCH PROUD RESTRAINING PURITY

RESTORES THE ELSE-BETRAYED, TOO-HUMAN HEART.

THE RAIN OF BLOOD

IN THE DARK YEAR AN ANGRY RAIN CAME DOWN

BLOOD-RED UPON THE HOT STONES OF THE TOWN.

BENEATH THE PELTING OF THAT LIQUID DROUGHT

NO GARDEN STOOD, NO SHATTERED STALK COULD SPROUT,

AS FROM A SUNLESS SKY ALL DAY IT RAINED

AND MEN CAME IN FROM STREETS OF TERROR STAINED

WITH THAT UNNATURAL ICHOR. UNDER NIGHT

IMPATIENT LOVERS DID NOT QUENCH THE LIGHT,

BUT LISTENING HEARD ABOVE EACH OTHER’S BREATH

THAT SOUND THE DYING HEARD IN ROOMS OF DEATH.

EACH LOUDLY ASKED ABROAD, AND NONE DARED TELL

WHAT OMEN IN THAT BURNING TORRENT FELL.

AND ALL NIGHT LONG WE LAY, WHILE OVERHEAD

THE DROPS RAINED DOWN AS IF THE HEAVENS BLED;

AND EVERY DAWN WE WOKE TO HEAR THE SOUND,

AND ALL MEN KNEW THAT THEY COULD STANCH THE WOUND,

BUT EACH LOOKED OUT AND CURSED THE STRICKEN TOWN,

THE GUILTY ROOFS ON WHICH THE RAIN CAME DOWN.

STEPPING BACKWARD

GOOD-BY TO YOU WHOM I SHALL SEE TOMORROW,

NEXT YEAR AND WHEN I’M FIFTY; STILL GOOD-BY.

THIS IS THE LEAVE WE NEVER REALLY TAKE.

IF YOU WERE DEAD OR GONE TO LIVE IN CHINA

THE EVENT MIGHT DRAW YOUR STATURE IN MY MIND.

I SHOULD BE FORCED TO LOOK UPON YOU WHOLE

THE WAY WE LOOK UPON THE THINGS WE LOSE.

WE SEE EACH OTHER DAILY AND IN SEGMENTS;

PARTING MIGHT MAKE US MEET ANEW, ENTIRE.

YOU ASKED ME ONCE, AND I COULD GIVE NO ANSWER,

HOW FAR DARE WE THROW OFF THE DAILY RUSE,

OFFICIAL TREACHERIES OF FACE AND NAME,

HAVE OUT OUR TRUE IDENTITY? I COULD HAZARD

AN ANSWER NOW, IF YOU ARE ASKING STILL.

WE ARE A SMALL AND LONELY HUMAN RACE

SHOWING NO SIGN OF MASTERING SOLITUDE

OUT ON THIS STONY PLANET THAT WE FARM.

THE MOST THAT WE CAN DO FOR ONE ANOTHER

IS LET OUR BLUNDERS AND OUR BLIND MISCHANCES

ARGUE A CERTAIN BRUSQUE ABRUPT COMPASSION.

WE MIGHT AS WELL BE TRUTHFUL. I SHOULD SAY

THEY’RE LUCKIEST WHO KNOW THEY’RE NOT UNIQUE;

BUT ONLY ART OR COMMON INTERCHANGE

CAN TEACH THAT KINDEST TRUTH. AND EVEN ART

CAN ONLY HINT AT WHAT DISTURBED A MELVILLE

OR CALMED A MAHLER’S FRENZY; YOU AND I

STILL LOOK FROM SEPARATE WINDOWS EVERY MORNING

UPON THE SAME WHITE DAYLIGHT IN THE SQUARE.

AND WHEN WE COME INTO EACH OTHER’S ROOMS

ONCE IN AWHILE, ENCUMBERED AND SELF-CONSCIOUS,

WE HOVER AWKWARDLY ABOUT THE THRESHOLD

AND USUALLY REGRET THE VISIT LATER.

PERHAPS THE HARSHEST FACT IS, ONLY LOVERS—

AND ONCE IN A WHILE TWO WITH THE GRACE OF LOVERS—

UNLEARN THAT CLUMSINESS OF RARE INTRUSION

AND LET EACH OTHER FREELY COME AND GO.

MOST OF US SHUT TOO QUICKLY INTO CUPBOARDS

THE MARGIN-SCRIBBLED BOOKS, THE DRIED GERANIUM,

THE PENNY HOROSCOPE, LETTERS NEVER MAILED.

THE DOOR MAY OPEN, BUT THE ROOM IS ALTERED;

NOT THE SAME ROOM WE LOOK FROM NIGHT AND DAY.

IT TAKES A LATE AND SLOWLY BLOOMING WISDOM

TO LEARN THAT THOSE WE MARKED INFALLIBLE

ARE TRAGIC-COMIC STUMBLERS LIKE OURSELVES.

THE KNOWLEDGE BREEDS RESERVE. WE WALK ON TIPTOE,

DEMANDING MORE THAN WE KNOW HOW TO RENDER.

TWO-EDGED DISCOVERY HUNTS US FINALLY DOWN;

THE HUMAN ACT WILL MAKE US REAL AGAIN,

AND THEN PERHAPS WE COME TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

LET US RETURN TO IMPERFECTION’S SCHOOL.

NO LONGER WANDERING AFTER PLATO’S GHOST,

SEEKING THE GARDEN WHERE ALL FRUIT IS FLAWLESS,

WE MUST AT LAST RENOUNCE THAT ULTIMATE BLUE

AND TAKE A WALK IN OTHER KINDS OF WEATHER.

THE SOUREST APPLE MAKES ITS WRY ANNOUNCEMENT

THAT IMPERFECTION HAS A CERTAIN TANG.

MAYBE WE SHOULDN’T TURN OUR POCKETS OUT

TO THE LAST CRUMB OR LINGERING BIT OF FLUFF,

BUT ALL WE CAN CONFESS OF WHAT WE ARE

HAS IN IT THE DEFEAT OF ISOLATION—

IF NOT OUR OWN, THEN SOMEONE’S ANYWAY.

SO I COME BACK TO SAYING THIS GOOD-BY,

A SORT OF CEREMONY OF MY OWN,

THIS STEPPING BACKWARD FOR ANOTHER GLANCE.

PERHAPS YOU’LL SAY WE NEED NO CEREMONY,

BECAUSE WE KNOW EACH OTHER, CRACK AND FLAW,

LIKE TWO IRREGULAR STONES THAT FIT TOGETHER.

YET STILL GOOD-BY, BECAUSE WE LIVE BY INCHES

AND ONLY SOMETIMES SEE THE FULL DIMENSION.

YOUR STATURE’S ONE I WANT TO MEMORIZE—

YOUR WHOLE LEVEL OF BEING, TO IMPOSE

ON ANY OTHER COMERS, MAN OR WOMAN.

I’D ASK THEM THAT THEY CARRY WHAT THEY ARE

WITH YOUR PARTICULAR BEARING, AS YOU WEAR

THE FLAWS THAT MAKE YOU BOTH YOURSELF AND HUMAN.

ITINERARY

THE GUIDEBOOKS PLAY DECEPTION; OCEANS ARE

A PROPERTY OF MIND. ALL MAPS ARE FICTION,

ALL TRAVELERS COME TO SEPARATE FRONTIERS.

THE COAST, THEY SAID, IS BARREN; BIRDS GO OVER

UNLIGHTING, IN SEARCH OF RICHER INLAND GARDENS.

NO GREEN WEED THRUSTS ITS TENDRIL FROM THE ROCK FACE.

VISIT IT IF YOU MUST; THEN TURN AGAIN

TO THE WARM PLEASING AIR OF COLORED TOWNS

WHERE RIVERS WIND TO LACE THE SUMMER VALLEYS.

THE COAST IS NAKED, SHARP WITH CLIFFS, UNKIND,

THEY SAID; SCRUB-BITTEN. INLAND THERE ARE GROVES

AND FÊTES OF LIGHT AND MUSIC.

BUT I HAVE SEEN

SUCH DENIZENS OF ENCHANTMENT PRINT THESE SANDS

AS SELDOM PROWL THE MARGINS OF OLD CHARTS:

STALLIONS OF VERD ANTIQUE AND WILD BROWN CHILDREN

AND TAILS OF MERMAIDS GLITTERING THROUGH THE SEA!

A REVIVALIST IN BOSTON

BUT YOU SHALL WALK THE GOLDEN STREET,

AND YOU UNHOUSE AND HOUSE THE LORD.

—GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS

GOING HOME BY LAMPLIGHT ACROSS BOSTON COMMON,

WE HEARD HIM TELL HOW GOD HAD ENTERED IN HIM,

AND NOW HE HAD THE WORD, AND NOTHING OTHER

WOULD DO BUT HE MUST CRY IT TO HIS BROTHER.

WE STOOD AND LISTENED THERE—TO NOTHING NEW.

YET SOMETHING LOOSED HIS TONGUE AND DROVE HIM SHOUTING.

COMPULSION’S NOT PLAY-ACTED IN A FACE,

AND HE WAS TELLING US THE WAY TO GRACE.

SOMEHOW WE SAW THE YOUTH THAT HE HAD BEEN,

NOT ONE TO NOTICE; AN ORDINARY BOY—

HARDLY THE ONE THE LORD WOULD MAKE HIS TOOL—

SHUFFLING HIS FEET IN BAPTIST SUNDAY SCHOOL.

AND THEN TRANSFIGURATION CAME HIS WAY;

HE KNEW THE SECRET ALL THE REST WERE SEEKING.

HE MADE THE TALE OF CHRISTENDOM HIS OWN,

AND HOARSELY CALLED HIS BRETHREN TO THE THRONE.

THE SAME OLD WAY; AND YET WE KNEW HE SAW

THE ANGELIC HOSTS WHOSE NAMES HE STUMBLED OVER.

HE MADE US HEAR THE RANKS OF SHINING FEET

TREADING TO GLORY’S THRONE UP TREMONT STREET.

THE RETURN OF THE EVENING GROSBEAKS

THE BIRDS ABOUT THE HOUSE PRETEND TO BE

PENATES OF OUR DOMESTICITY.

AND WHEN THE CARDINAL WANTS TO PLAY AT PROPHET

WE NEVER TELL HIS EMINENCE TO COME OFF IT.

THE CROWS, TOO, IN THE DAWN PROGNOSTICATE

LIKE MINISTERS AT A FUNERAL OF STATE.

THE PIGEONS IN THEIR SURPLICES OF WHITE

ASSEMBLE FOR SOME CAREFUL ANGLICAN RITE.

ONLY THESE GUESTS WHO RARELY COME OUR WAY

DICTATE NO ORACLES FOR US WHILE THEY STAY.

NO MATTER WHAT WE TRY TO MAKE THEM MEAN

THEIR COMING LENDS NO ANSWER TO OUR SCENE.

WE SCATTER SEED AND CALL THEM BY THEIR NAME,

REMEMBERING WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE LAST THEY CAME.

THE SPRINGBOARD

LIKE DIVERS, WE OURSELVES MUST MAKE THE JUMP

THAT SETS THE TAUT BOARD BOUNDING UNDERFOOT

CLEAN AS AN AXE BLADE DRIVEN IN A STUMP;

BUT AFTERWARD WHAT MAKES THE BODY SHOOT

INTO ITS PURE AND IRRESISTIBLE CURVE

IS OF A FORCE BEYOND ALL BODILY POWERS.

SO ACTION TAKES VELOCITY WITH A VERVE

SWIFTER, MORE SURE THAN ANY WILL OF OURS.

A CHANGE OF WORLD

FASHIONS ARE CHANGING IN THE SPHERE.

OCEANS ARE ASKING WAVE BY WAVE

WHAT NEW SHAPES WILL BE WORN NEXT YEAR;

AND THE MOUNTAINS, STOOPED AND GRAVE,

ARE WONDERING SILENTLY RANGE BY RANGE

WHAT IF THEY PROVE TOO OLD FOR THE CHANGE.

THE LITTLE TAILORS BUSILY SITTING

FLASHING THEIR SHEARS IN RIVAL HASTE

WON’T SPARE TIME FOR A PRIOR FITTING—

IN WITH THE STITCHES, TOO LATE TO BASTE.

THEY SAY THE SEASON FOR DOUBT HAS PASSED:

THE CHANGES COMING ARE DUE TO LAST.

UNSOUNDED

MARINER UNPRACTICED,

IN THIS CHARTLESS ZONE

EVERY NAVIGATOR

FARES UNWARNED, ALONE.

EACH HIS OWN MAGELLAN

IN TROPICS OF SENSATION:

NOT A FIRE-SCORCHED STONE

FROM PRIOR HABITATION,

NOT AN ARCHAIC HULL

SPLINTERED ON THE BEACH.

THESE ARE LATITUDES REVEALED

SEPARATE TO EACH.

DESIGN IN LIVING COLORS

EMBROIDERED IN A TAPESTRY OF GREEN

AMONG THE TEXTURES OF A THREADED GARDEN,

THE GESTURING LADY AND HER PALADIN

WALK IN A PATH WHERE SHADE AND SUNLIGHT HARDEN

UPON THE FORMAL ATTITUDES OF TREES

BY NO WIND BENT, AND BIRDS WITHOUT A TUNE,

AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF A FIGURED FRIEZE

IN AN ETERNAL SUMMER AFTERNOON.

SO YOU AND I IN OUR ACCEPTED FRAME

BELIEVE A CASUAL WORLD OF BRICKS AND FLOWERS

AND SCARCELY GUESS WHAT SYMBOLS WANDER TAME

AMONG THE PANELS OF FAMILIAR HOURS.

YET SHOULD THE PARTING BOUGHS OF GREEN REVEAL

A SLENDER UNICORN WITH JEWELED FEET,

COULD I PERSUADE HIM AT MY TOUCH TO KNEEL

AND FROM MY FINGERS TAKE WHAT UNICORNS EAT?

IF YOU SHOULD PICK ME AT MY WHIM A ROSE,

SETTING THE BIRDS UPON THE BUSH IN FLIGHT,

HOW SHOULD I KNOW WHAT CRIMSON MEANING GROWS

DEEP IN THIS GARDEN, WHERE SUCH BIRDS ALIGHT?

AND HOW SHOULD I BELIEVE, THE MEANING CLEAR,

THAT WE ARE CHILDREN OF DISORDERED DAYS?

THAT FRAGMENTARY WORLD IS MENDED HERE,

AND IN THIS AIR A CLEARER SUNLIGHT PLAYS.

THE FLEEING HARE, THE WINGS THAT BRUSH THE TREE,

ALL IMAGES ONCE SEPARATE AND ALONE,

BECOME THE CREATURES OF A TAPESTRY

MIRACULOUSLY STIRRED AND MADE OUR OWN.

WE ARE THE DENIZENS OF A LIVING WOOD

WHERE INSIGHT BLOOMS ANEW ON EVERY BOUGH,

AND EVERY FLOWER EMERGES UNDERSTOOD

OUT OF A PATTERN UNPERCEIVED TILL NOW.

WALDEN 1950

THOREAU, LANK GHOST, COMES BACK TO VISIT CONCORD,

FINDS THE TOWN LIKE ALL TOWNS, MUCH THE SAME—

A LITTLE LESS REMOTE, LESS INDEPENDENT.

THE CARS HURL THROUGH FROM DAWN TO DAWN TOWARD BOSTON

PAYING OUT SPEED LIKE A LIFELINE BETWEEN TOWNS.

SOME OF THEM PAUSE TO LOOK AT ALCOTT’S HOUSE.

NO FARMER STUDIES LATIN NOW; THE LANGUAGE

OF SOIL AND MARKET WOULD CONFOUND A SCHOLAR;

AND ANY YANKEE SON WITH LONESOME NOTIONS

WOULD FIND LIFE HARDER IN THE TOWN TODAY.

UNDER THE TREES BY WALDEN POND, THE STALLS

WHERE SUMMER PILGRIMS PAUSE BESIDE THE ROAD,

DROWN RESINOUS NIGHT IN BUSY RIVALRY

WHILE THE YOUNG MAKE BOISTEROUS LOVE ALONG THE SHORES.

HE USED TO HEAR THE LOCOMOTIVE WHISTLE

SOUND THROUGH THE WOODS LIKE A HAWK’S RESTLESS CRY.

NOW THE TRAINS RUN THROUGH CONCORD NIGHT AND DAY,

AND NOBODY STOPS TO LISTEN. THE GHOST MIGHT SMILE—

THE WAY A MAN IN SOLITUDE WOULD SMILE—

REMEMBERING ALL THE SOUNDS THAT PASSED FOR SOUND

A CENTURY AGO.

HE WOULD REMAIN

AWAY FROM HOUSES OTHER GHOSTS MIGHT VISIT,

NOT HAVING COME TO TELL A THING OR TWO

OR LAY A CURSE (WHAT CURSE COULD FRIGHTEN NOW?)

NO TAPPING ON THE WINDOWPANE FOR HIM

OR TWILIGHT CONVERSATION IN THE STREETS

WITH SOME BEWILDERED TOWNSMAN GOING HOME.

IF HE HAD ANY ERRAND, IT WOULD BE

MORE LIKELY CURIOSITY OF HIS OWN

ABOUT THE HUMAN RACE, AT LEAST IN CONCORD.

HE WOULD NOT COME SO FAR FROM DISTANT WOODS

MERELY TO SET THEM WONDERING AGAIN.

SUNDAY EVENING

WE ARE TWO ACQUAINTANCES ON A TRAIN,

RATTLING BACK THROUGH DARKENING TWILIGHT SUBURBS

FROM A WEEKEND IN THE COUNTRY, INTO TOWN.

THE STATION LIGHTS FLARE PAST US, AND WE GLANCE

FURTIVELY AT OUR WATCHES, SIT UPRIGHT

ON LEATHER BENCHES IN THE SMOKE-DIM CAR

AND TRY TO MAKE APPROPRIATE CONVERSATION.

WE COME FROM SIMILAR STREETS IN THE SAME CITY

AND HAVE SPENT THIS SAME HIATUS OF THREE DAYS

ESCAPING STREETS AND LIVES THAT WE HAVE CHOSEN.

ESCAPE BY DECK CHAIRS SPRAWLED ON EVENING LAWNS,

BY CITRONELLA AND BY VISITANT MOTHS;

ESCAPE BY SAND AND WATER IN THE EYES,

AND SEA-NOISE DROWNED IN WEEKEND CONVERSATION.

UNEASY, ALMOST, THAT WE MEET AGAIN,

IMPATIENT FOR THIS RATTLING RIDE TO END,

WE STILL ARE STRICKEN WITH A DREAD OF PASSING

TIME, THE COMING LONELINESS OF TRAVELERS

PARTING IN HOLLOW STATIONS, GOING HOME

TO SILENT ROOMS IN TOO-FAMILIAR STREETS

WITH UNKNOWN FOOTSTEPS PACING OVERHEAD.

FOR THERE ARE THINGS WE MIGHT HAVE TALKED ABOUT,

AND THERE ARE SIGNS WE MIGHT HAVE SHARED IN COMMON.

WE LOOK OUT VAINLY AT THE PASSING STATIONS

AS IF SOME LAMPLIT SHED OR GLEAMING ROOF

MIGHT REAWAKE THE SIGN IN BOTH OF US.

BUT THIS IS ONLY RYE OR DARIEN,

AND WHOEVER WE BOTH KNEW THERE HAS MOVED AWAY.

AND I SUPPOSE THERE NEVER WILL BE TIME

TO SPEAK OF MORE THAN THIS—THE CHANGE IN WEATHER,

THE LATENESS OF THE TRAIN ON SUNDAY EVENINGS—

NEVER ENOUGH OR ALWAYS TOO MUCH TIME.

LIFE LURCHES PAST US LIKE A WINDOWED TWILIGHT

SEEN FROM A TRAIN THAT HALTS AT LITTLE JUNCTIONS

WHERE WEEKEND HALF-ACQUAINTANCES SAY GOOD-BY.

THE INNOCENTS

THEY SAID TO US, OR TRIED TO SAY, AND FAILED:

WITH DUST IMPLICIT IN THE UNCURLED GREEN

FIRST LEAF, AND ALL THE EARLY GARDEN KNOWING

THAT AFTER ROSE-RED PETALS COMES THE BLEAK

IMPOVERISHED STALK, THE BLACK DEJECTED LEAF

CRUMPLED AND DANK, WE SHOULD AT MAYTIME BE

LESS CHILDLIKE IN DELIGHT, A LITTLE RESERVED,

A LITTLE COGNIZANT OF ROOTED DEATH.

AND YET BENEATH THE FLECKED LEAF-GILDED BOUGHS

ALONG THE PATHS FERN-FRINGED AND DELICATE,

WE SUPPLE CHILDREN PLAYED AT GOLDEN AGE,

AND KNELT UPON THE CURVING STEPS TO SNARE

THE WHISKING EMERALD LIZARDS, OR TO COAX

THE ANCESTRAL TORTOISE FROM HIS ONYX SHELL

IN LEMON SUNLIGHT ON THE BALCONY.

AND ONLY PEDAGOGUES AND THE BRITTLE OLD

EXISTED TO DECLARE MORTALITY,

AND THEY WERE BEINGS REMOVED IN WALK AND SPEECH.

FOR APPREHENSION FEEDS ON INTELLECT:

UNEASY GHOSTS IN LIBRARIES ARE BRED—

WHILE INNOCENT SENSUALITY ABIDES

IN CHARMED PERCEPTION OF AN HOUR, A DAY,

INGENUOUS AND UNAFRAID OF TIME.

SO IN THE GARDEN WE WERE FREE OF FEAR,

AND WHAT THE SAFFRON ROSES OR THE GREEN

IMPERIAL DRAGONFLIES ABOVE THE LAKE

KNEW ABOUT ALTERED SEASONS, BOUGHS DESPOILED,

THEY NEVER MURMURED; AND TO US NO MATTER

HOW IN THE DRAWING ROOM THE ELDERS SAT

BALANCING TEACUPS BEHIND CURTAINED GLASS,

WHILE RARE MIRACULOUS CLOCKS IN CRYSTAL DOMES

IMPALED THE AIR WITH SPLINTERED CHIPS OF TIME

FOREVER SOUNDING THROUGH THE TEA-THIN TALK,

AN ORGANPOINT TO DESPERATE ANIMATION.

THEY KNEW, AND TRIED TO SAY TO US, BUT FAILED;

THEY KNEW WHAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED.

“HE REMEMBERETH THAT WE ARE DUST”

AND WHEN WAS DUST A THING SO RASH?

OR WHEN COULD DUST SUPPORT THE LASH

AND STAND AS ARROGANT AS STONE?

AND WHERE HAS REVELATION SHOWN

CONCEIT AND RAGE SO INTERFUSED

IN DUST, THAT SUNS HAVE STOOD BEMUSED

TO WATCH THE RECKLESS CONSEQUENCE?

AND WHEN DID DUST BREAK RETICENCE

TO SING ALOUD WITH ALL ITS MIGHT

IN EGOTISTICAL DELIGHT?

YET WHEN THE TALE IS TOLD OF WIND

THAT LIFTED DUST AND DROVE BEHIND

TO SCOOP THE VALLEYS FROM THEIR SLEEP

AND BURY LANDSCAPES INCHES DEEP

TILL THERE MUST FOLLOW YEARS OF RAIN

BEFORE THE EARTH COULD BREATHE AGAIN—

OR WHEN THE APPETITE OF FIRE

BLAZES BEYOND CONTROL AND HIGHER,

THEN SINKS INTO THE SULLEN WASTE

OF WHAT, DEVOURING, IT EFFACED,

AND THINLY IN MY PALM I HOLD

THE DUST OF ASH GROWN WAN AND COLD,

I KNOW WHAT ELEMENT I CHOSE

TO BUILD SUCH ANGER, MOULD SUCH WOES.

LIFE AND LETTERS

AN OLD MAN’S WASTING BRAIN; A RUINED CITY

WHERE HERE AND THERE AGAINST THE FEBRILE SKY

THE SHAFT OF AN UNBROKEN COLUMN RISES,

AND IN THE SANDS INDIFFERENT LIZARDS KEEP

THE SHATTERED TRACES OF OLD MONUMENTS.

HERE WHERE THE DEATH OF THE IMAGINATION

TRANCES THE MIND WITH SHADOW, HERE THE SHAPES

OF TUMBLED ARCH AND PEDIMENT STAND OUT

IN THEIR LAST VIOLENCE OF ILLUMINATION.

BY DAY HIS VALET RULES HIM, FORCING HIM

WITH MILK AND MEDICINES, A DEFERENCE

CLOAKING THE BULLY. “SIGNORA X WAS HERE

DURING YOUR NAP; I TOLD HER DOCTOR’S ORDERS,

YOU MUST STAY QUIET AND REST, KEEP UP YOUR STRENGTH.”

HE LEAVES THE PASTEBOARD RECTANGLE, ENGRAVED,

SCRAWLED IN REGRETFUL HASTE, AND GOES HIS WAY

TO JOIN A LOUNGING CRONY BELOWSTAIRS.

(“THE OLD MAN’S NOT SO WIDE AWAKE TODAY.”)

THE IVORY BODY IN THE DRESSING GOWN

(NOT THE SILK ROBE THE COUNTESS SENT; HE SPILLS

HIS MILK SOMETIMES, AND THAT WOULD BE A PITY)

STIRS IN THE SINKING WARMTH THAT BATHES HIS CHAIR

AND LOOKS ON SUMMER SUNLIGHT IN THE SQUARE.

BELOW, THE FAT CONCIERGE POINTS OUT HIS WINDOW

WITH HALF-DRAWN BLINDS, TO TOURISTS WHO INQUIRE.

THERE ARE A FEW WHO MAKE THE PILGRIMAGE;

THEY STAND AND GAZE AND GO AWAY AGAIN.

SOMETHING TO SAY THAT ONE HAS STOOD BENEATH

HIS WINDOW, THOUGH THEY NEVER SEE HIMSELF.

THE POST BRINGS LETTERS STAMPED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.

HE HOLDS THEM IN HIS FINGERS, TURNS THEM OVER.

“HE ALWAYS SAYS HE MEANS TO READ THEM LATER,

BUT I SHOULD SAY HIS READING DAYS ARE FINISHED.

ALL HE DOES NOW IS WATCH THE SQUARE BELOW.

HE SEEMS CONTENT ENOUGH; AND I’VE NO TROUBLE.

AN EASY LIFE, TO WATCH HIM TO HIS GRAVE.”

THE LETTERS STILL ARRIVE FROM UNIVERSITIES,

OCCASIONALLY A CHARITABLE CAUSE,

A FAVOR-SEEKER, OR AN AGED FRIEND.

BUT NOW IT SEEMS NO ANSWERS ARE EXPECTED

FROM ONE WHOSE CORRESPONDENCE IS COLLECTED

IN TWO LARGE VOLUMES, EDITED WITH NOTES.

WHAT SHOULD THAT TIMID HAND BENEATH ITS SLEEVE

WARMED BY THE RICH ITALIAN SUN, INDITE

TO VINDICATE ITS FINAL QUARTER-DECADE?

NO; HE HAS WRITTEN ALL THAT CAN BE KNOWN.

IF ANYTHING, TOO MUCH; HIS GREEDY ART

LEFT NO DOMAIN UNPILLAGED, GREW ITS BREADTH

FROM FASTENING ON EVERY LIFE HE TOUCHED.

(SOME WENT TO LAW, SOME SMILED, SOME NEVER GUESSED.)

BUT NOW THE ART HAS LEFT THE MAN TO REST.

THE FAILING SEARCHLIGHT OF HIS MIND REMAINS

TO THROW ITS WAVERING CONE OF RECOGNITION

BACKWARD UPON THOSE TEEMING IMAGES.

NEW YORK INVADES THE MEMORY AGAIN:

A MILLION JEWELS CROWD THE BOYISH BRAIN

WITH APPREHENSION OF AN UNMASTERED WORLD.

THE RED-HAIRED GIRL WAVES FROM THE BROOKLYN FERRY,

THE BRIDGES LEAP LIKE FOUNTAINS INTO NOON.

AGAIN THE TRAIN GOES ROCKING ACROSS-COUNTRY

PAST MIDNIGHT PLATFORMS WHERE THE REDDISH LIGHT

PLAYS ON A GAME OF CHECKERS THROUGH THE WINDOW,

TILL DAWN SPELLS SNOW ON EMPTINESS OF PLAINS.

ONCE MORE IN SAN FRANCISCO MARGARET WAKES

BESIDE HIM IN THE HEAT OF AUGUST DARK,

STILL WEEPING FROM A NIGHTMARE.

SO BY DAY

HE LOOKS ON SUMMER SUNLIGHT IN THE SQUARE.

THE GRINNING BACCHUS TRICKLES FROM HIS GOURD

A THIN BRIGHT SPUME OF WATER IN THE BASIN,

WHILE THE HOT TILES GROW COOL AS EVENING DROPS

DEEP COBALT FROM WHITE BUILDINGS. FAR IN AIR

BUONARROTI’S DOME DELAYS THE GOLD.

THE OLD MAN WHO HAS COME TO ROME TO DIE

IGNORES THE DEATH OF STILL ANOTHER DAY.

SO MANY DAYS HAVE DIED AND COME TO LIFE

THAT TIME AND PLACE SEEM ORDERED BY HIS VALET;

HE PUTS THEM ON AND OFF AS HE IS TOLD.

NOW HE IS STANDING BAREHEADED IN DUSK

WHILE FIREWORKS RAIN INTO THE SEA AT BIARRITZ,

AND AT HIS SHOULDER LOUIS SCARAPIN

QUOTES LA FONTAINE. THE GIDDY WINDS OF FORTUNE

MAKE LOVE TO HIM THAT NIGHT; AND HE RECALLS

TOASTS DRUNK BY ROCKETLIGHT, AND LOUIS’ VOICE

WITH ITS PERPETUAL DRAWL: “MON BON MONSIEUR …”

LOUIS, WHO COULD HAVE MADE THE WORLD MORE SANE,

BUT KILLED HIMSELF INSTEAD, A PIERROT-GESTURE,

HIS FACE A WHITENESS IN THE DARK APARTMENT.

THE BITTER COFFEE DRUNK ON EARLY MORNINGS

WITH SANDRA’S STRAW HAT HANGING FROM THE BEDPOST,

RED ROSES, LIKE A BONNET BY RENOIR.

AND THE INCESSANT TAPPING OF HER HEELS

LATE EVENINGS ON THE COBBLES AS THEY STROLL:

SPLINTERS TO TINGLE IN AN OLD MAN’S BRAIN.

AGAIN THE CONSUMPTIVE NEIGHBOR THROUGH THE WALL

BEGINS HIS EVENING AGONY OF COUGHING

TILL ONE IS READY TO SCREAM HIM INTO SILENCE.

AND THE ACCORDION ON THE RIVER STEAMER

PLAYS SOMETHING FROM LAST SEASON, FOOLISH, GAY;

DEAF EARS PRESERVE THE MUSIC OF A DAY.

LIFE HAS THE FINAL WORD; HE CANNOT RULE

THOSE FLOATING PICTURES AS HE RULED THEM ONCE,

FORCING THEM INTO FORM; THE VIOLENT GARDENER,

THE TWO-EDGED HEART THAT CUTS INTO EVERY WOUND,

RECIPROCATES EXPERIENCE WITH ART.

NO MORE OF THAT FOR NOW; THE BOUGHS GROW WILD,

THE WILLFUL STEMS PUT FORTH UNDISCIPLINED BLOOMS,

AND WINDS SWEEP THROUGH AND SHATTER. HERE AT LAST

ANARCHY OF A THOUSAND ROSES TANGLES

THE FALLEN ARCHITECTURE OF THE MIND.

FOR THE CONJUNCTION OF TWO PLANETS

WE SMILE AT ASTROLOGICAL HOPES

AND LEAVE THE SKY TO EXPERT MEN

WHO DO NOT RECKON HOROSCOPES

BUT PAINFULLY EXTEND THEIR KEN

IN MATHEMATICAL DEBATE

WITH SLIDE AND PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE.

AND YET, PROTEST IT IF WE WILL,

SOME CORNER OF THE MIND RETAINS

THE MEDIEVAL MAN, WHO STILL

KEEPS WATCH UPON THOSE STARRY SKEINS

AND DRIVES US OUT OF DOORS AT NIGHT

TO GAZE AT ANAGRAMS OF LIGHT.

WHATEVER REGISTER OR LAW

IS DRAWN IN DIGITS FOR THESE TWO,

VENUS AND JUPITER KEEP THEIR AWE,

WARDENS OF BRILLIANCE, AS THEY DO

THEIR DUAL CIRCUIT OF THE WEST—

THE BRIGHTEST PLANET AND HER GUEST.

IS ANY LIGHT SO PROUDLY THRUST

FROM DARKNESS ON OUR LIFTED FACES

A SIGN OF SOMETHING WE CAN TRUST,

OR IS IT THAT IN STARRY PLACES

WE SEE THE THINGS WE LONG TO SEE

IN FIERY ICONOGRAPHY?

THE PRISONERS

ENCLOSED IN THIS DISTURBING MUTUAL WOOD,

WOUNDED ALIKE BY THORNS OF THE SAME TREE,

WE SEEK IN HOPELESS WAR EACH OTHER’S BLOOD

THOUGH SUFFERING IN ONE IDENTITY.

EACH TO THE OTHER PREY AND HUNTSMAN KNOWN,

STILL DRIVEN TOGETHER, LONELIER THAT ALONE.

STRANGE MATING OF THE LOSER AND THE LOST!

WITH FACES STIFF AS MOURNERS’, WE INTRUDE

FOREVER ON THE ONE EACH TURNS FROM MOST,

EACH WANDERING IN A DOUBLE SOLITUDE.

THE UNPURGED GHOSTS OF PASSION BOUND BY PRIDE

WHO WAKE IN ISOLATION, SIDE BY SIDE.

1950

NIGHT

THE MOTES THAT STILL DISTURBED HER LIDDED CALM

WERE THESE: THE TICK AND WHISPER OF A SHADE

AGAINST THE SILL; A COBWEB-FILM THAT HUNG

ASLANT A CORNER MOULDING, TOO ELUSIVE

FOR ANY BUT THE GAZE OF STRAITENED EYES;

THE NIMBUS OF THE NIGHT-LAMP, WHERE A MOTH

UNEASILY EXPLORED THE EDGE OF LIGHT

THROUGH HOURS OF FRACTURED DARKNESS. SHE ALONE

KNEW THAT THE ROOM CONTAINED THESE THINGS; SHE LAY

HEARING THE ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE SOUND

(AS IF A LIVE THING SHIVERED BEHIND THE CURTAINS)

WATCHING THE THREAD THAT FRAYED IN GUSTS OF AIR

MORE DELICATE THAN HER BREATHING, OR BY NIGHT

SHARING A MOTH’S PERPLEXITY AT LIGHT

TOO FRAIL TO DRIVE OUT DARK: MINUTIAE

HELD IN THE VISE OF SENSE ABOUT TO DIE.

1950

THE HOUSE AT THE CASCADES

ALL CHANGED NOW THROUGH NEGLECT. THE STEPS DISMANTLED

BY INFANTRIES OF ANTS, BY ROOTS AND STORMS,

THE PILLARS TUGGED BY VINES, THE PORTE-COCHÈRE

A PASSAGEWAY FOR WINDS, THE SOLEMN PORCHES

WARPED INTO CARICATURES.

WE CAME AT EVENING

AFTER THE RAIN, WHEN EVERY DRUNKEN LEAF

WAS STRAINING, SWELLING IN A RIOT OF GREEN.

ONLY THE HOUSE WAS DYING IN ALL THAT LIFE,

AS IF A TRIUMPH OF EMERALD ENERGY

HAD FIXED ITS MOUTH UPON THE WALLS AND STONES.

THE TAMEST SHRUB REMEMBERED ANARCHY

AND JOINED IN APPETITE WITH THE DEMAGOGUE WEED

THAT SPRINGS WHERE ORDER FALLS; TOGETHER THERE

THEY STORMED THE DEFENSELESS HANDIWORK OF MAN

WHOSE EMPIRE WARS AGAINST HIM WHEN HE TURNS

A MOMENT FROM THE YOKE. SO, TURNING BACK,

HE SEES HIS ROOFTREE FALL TO FURIOUS GREEN,

HIS YARD DESPOILED, AND OUT OF INNOCENT NOON

THE INSECT-CLOUD LIKE THUNDER ON THE LAND.

1951

THE ROADWAY

WHEN THE FOOTBRIDGE WASHES AWAY,

AND THE LIGHTS ALONG THE BANK

ACCOST EACH OTHER NO LONGER,

BUT THE WILD GRASS GROWS UP RANK,

AND NO ONE COMES TO STAND

WHERE NEIGHBOR AND NEIGHBOR STOOD,

AND EACH HOUSE IS DRAWN IN TO ITSELF

AND SHUTTERED AGAINST THE ROAD,

UNDER EACH SEPARATE ROOF

THE FAMILIAR LIFE GOES ON:

THE HEARTH IS SWEPT UP AT NIGHT,

THE TABLE LAID IN THE DAWN,

AND MAN AND WOMAN AND CHILD

EAT THEIR ACCUSTOMED MEAL,

GIVE THANKS AND TURN TO THEIR DAY

AS IF BY AN ACT OF WILL.

NOWHERE IS EVIL SPOKEN,

THOUGH SOMETHING DEEP IN THE HEART

REFUSES TO MEND THE BRIDGE

AND CAN NEVER MAKE A START

ALONG THE ABANDONED PATH

TO THE HOUSE AT LEFT OR AT RIGHT,

WHERE NEIGHBOR AND NEIGHBOR’S CHILDREN

AWAKE TO THE SAME DAYLIGHT.

GOOD MEN GROWN LONG ACCUSTOMED

TO INFLEXIBLE WAYS OF MIND—

WHICH OF THEM COULD SAY CLEARLY

WHAT FIRST DROVE KIND FROM KIND?

COURTEOUS TO ANY STRANGER,

FORBEARING WITH WIFE AND CHILD—

YET ALONG THE COMMON ROADWAY

THE WILD GRASS STILL GROWS WILD.

PICTURES BY VUILLARD

NOW WE REMEMBER ALL: THE WILD PEAR-TREE,

THE BROKEN RIBBONS OF THE GREEN-AND-GOLD

PORTFOLIO, WITH SKETCHES FROM AN OLD

ALGERIAN CAMPAIGN; THE PLACID THREE

WOMEN AT COFFEE BY THE WINDOW, FATES

OF NOTHING OMINOUS, WAITING FOR THE RING

OF THE POSTMAN’S BELL; WE HARBOR EVERYTHING—

THE CORES OF FRUIT LEFT ON THE LUNCHEON PLATES.

WE ARE LED BACK WHERE WE HAVE NEVER BEEN,

MIDDAY WHERE NOTHING’S TRAGIC, ALL’S DELAYED

AS IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOR US AS WELL—THAT SHADE

OF SUMMER ALWAYS, NEUILLY DAPPLED GREEN!

BUT WE, THE DESTINED READERS OF STENDHAL,

IN MONSTROUS CHANGE SUCH CONSOLATIONS FIND

AS RESTLESS MOCKERY SETS BEFORE THE MIND

TO DEAL WITH WHAT MUST ANGER AND APPALL.

MUCH OF THE TIME WE SCARCELY THINK OF SIGHING

FOR AFTERNOONS THAT FOUND US BORN TOO LATE.

OUR PRUDENT ENVY RARELY PACES SPYING

UNDER THOSE WALLS, THAT LILAC-SHADOWED GATE.

YET AT THIS MOMENT, IN OUR PRIVATE VIEW,

A BREATH OF COMMON PEACE, LIKE MEMORY,

RUSTLES THE BRANCHES OF THE WILD PEAR-TREE—

AIR THAT WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN, AND CANNOT KNOW.

ORIENT WHEAT

OUR FATHERS IN THEIR BOOKS AND SPEECH

HAVE MADE THE MATTER PLAIN:

THE GREEN FIELDS THEY WALKED IN ONCE

WILL NEVER GROW AGAIN.

THE CORN LIES UNDER THE LOCUST’S TOOTH

OR BLISTERED IN THE SUN;

THE FACES OF THE OLD PROUD STOCK

ARE GONE WHERE THEIR YEARS ARE GONE.

THE PARK WHERE STAGS LAY DOWN AT NOON

UNDER THE GREAT TREES

IS SHRILL WITH SUNDAY STROLLERS NOW,

LITTERED WITH THEIR LEES.

POACHERS HAVE TRAMPLED DOWN THE MAZE

AND CHOKED THE FOUNTAINS DRY;

THE LAST SWAN OF A SCORE AND TEN

GOES AMONG REEDS TO DIE.

WE WERE BORN TO SMELLS OF PLAGUE,

CHALK-MARKS ON EVERY DOOR;

WE NEVER HAVE HEARD THE HUNTING-HORN

OR FEET ON THE GALLERY FLOOR—

THE HIGH-ARCHED FEET OF DANCERS

WHO KNEW HOW TO STEP AND STAND.

WE WERE BORN OF A LEANING HOUSE

IN A CHANGED, UNEASY LAND.

OUR FATHERS CURSE THE CROOKED TIME

AND GO TO THEIR GRAVES AT LAST;

WHILE SOME OF US LAUGH AT DOTING MEN,

AND OTHERS SIGH FOR THE PAST.

AND THE DAZZLED LOVERS LIE

WHERE SUMMER BURNS BLUE AND GREEN,

IN THE GREEN FIELDS THEY’LL BE SAYING

CAN NEVER GROW AGAIN.

VERSAILLES

(PETIT TRIANON)

MERELY THE LANDSCAPE OF A VANISHED WHIM,

AN ARTIFICE THAT LASTS BEYOND THE WISH:

THE GROTTO BY THE POND, THE GULPING FISH

THAT ROUND AND ROUND PRETENDED ISLANDS SWIM,

THE CREAMERY ABANDONED TO ITS DOVES,

THE EMPTY SHRINE THE GUIDEBOOKS SAY IS LOVE’S.

WHAT WIND CAN BLEAKEN THIS, WHAT WEATHER CHASTEN

THOSE BALUSTRADES OF STONE, THAT SKY STONE-PALE?

A FOUNTAIN TRITON IDLY SOAKS HIS TAIL

IN THE LAST PUDDLE OF A DRYING BASIN;

A LEISURE THAT NO HUMAN WILL CAN HASTEN

DRIPS FROM THE HOLLOW OF HIS LIFTED SHELL.

WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER GARDENS WERE FOR GAMES,

BUT NOW ACROSS THE SUNGILT LAWN OF KINGS

WE DRIFT, CONSULTING CATALOGUES FOR NAMES

OF POSTURED GODS: THE CRY OF CLOSING RINGS

FOR US AND FOR THE COUPLES IN THE WOOD

AND ALL GOOD CHILDREN WHO ARE ALL TOO GOOD.

O CHILDREN, NEXT YEAR, CHILDREN, YOU WILL PLAY

WITH ONLY HALF YOUR HEARTS; BE WILD TODAY.

AND LOVERS, TAKE ONE LONG AND FAST EMBRACE

BEFORE THE SUN THAT TARNISHED QUEENS GOES DOWN,

AND EVENING FINDS YOU IN A RESTLESS TOWN

WHERE EACH HAS BACK HIS OLD RESTRICTED FACE.

ANNOTATION FOR AN EPITAPH

A FAIRER PERSON LOST NOT HEAVEN.

—PARADISE LOST

THESE ARE THE SINS FOR WHICH THEY CAST OUT ANGELS,

THE BAGATELLES BY WHICH THE LOVELY FALL:

A HAND THAT DISAPPOINTS, AN EYE DISSEMBLING—

THESE AND A FEW BESIDES: YOU HAD THEM ALL.

BENEATH THIS CHERUBED STONE RECLINES THE BEAUTY

THAT CHERUBS AT THE CHAIR WILL NEVER SEE,

SHUT OUT FOREVER BY THE GOLD BATTALIONS

STERN TO FORGIVE, MORE RIGOROUS THAN WE.

OH, WE WERE QUICK TO HIDE OUR EYES FROM FOIBLE

AND CALL SUCH BEAUTY TRUTH; WHAT THOUGH WE KNEW?

NEVER WAS TRUTH SO SWEET AND SO OUTRAGEOUS;

WE LOVED YOU ALL THE MORE BECAUSE UNTRUE.

BUT IN THE BAROQUE CORRIDORS OF HEAVEN

YOUR LIVELY COMING IS A HOPE DESTROYED.

SQUADRONS OF SERAPHS PASS THE NEWS AND PONDER,

AND ALL THEIR LUXURY GLITTERS GRAND AND VOID.

IDEAL LANDSCAPE

WE HAD TO TAKE THE WORLD AS IT WAS GIVEN:

THE NURSEMAID SITTING PASSIVE IN THE PARK

WAS RARELY BY A CHANGELING PRINCE ACCOSTED.

THE MORNINGS HAPPENED SIMILAR AND STARK

IN ROOMS OF SELFHOOD WHERE WE WOKE AND LAY

WATCHING TODAY UNFOLD LIKE YESTERDAY.

OUR FRIENDS WERE NOT UNEARTHLY BEAUTIFUL,

NOR SPOKE WITH TONGUES OF GOLD; OUR LOVERS BLUNDERED

NOW AND AGAIN WHEN MOST WE SOUGHT PERFECTION,

OR HID IN CUPBOARDS WHEN THE HEAVENS THUNDERED.

THE HUMAN ROSE TO HAUNT US EVERYWHERE,

RAW, FLAWED, AND ASKING MORE THAN WE COULD BEAR.

AND ALWAYS TIME WAS RUSHING LIKE A TRAM

THROUGH STREETS OF A FOREIGN CITY, STREETS WE SAW

OPENING INTO GREAT AND SUNNY SQUARES

WE COULD NOT FIND AGAIN, NO MAP COULD SHOW—

NEVER THOSE FOUNTAINS TOSSED IN THAT SAME LIGHT,

THOSE GILDED TREES, THOSE STATUES GREEN AND WHITE.

THE CELEBRATION
IN THE PLAZA

THE SENTIMENTALIST SENDS HIS MAUVE BALLOON

MEANDERING INTO AIR. THE CROWD APPLAUDS.

THE MAYOR EATS ICES WITH A CARDBOARD SPOON.

SEE HOW THAT COLOR CHARMS THE SUNSET AIR;

A TOUCH OF LAVENDER IS WHAT WAS NEEDED.—

THEN, POP! NO FLOATING LAVENDER ANYWHERE.

HURRAH, THE PYROTECHNIC ENGINEER

COMES WITH HIS SPARKLING TRICKS, CONSULTS THE SKY,

WAITS FOR THE PERFECT INSTANT TO APPEAR.

BOUQUETS OF GOLD SPLASH INTO BLOOM AND POUR

THEIR HISSING POLLEN DOWNWARD ON THE DUSK.

NOTHING LIKE THIS WAS EVER SEEN BEFORE.

THE VICEROY OF FIREWORKS GOES HIS WAY,

LEAVING US WITH A SKY SO DULL AND BARE

THE CROWD THINS OUT: WHAT CONJURES THEM TO STAY?

THE ROAD IS COLD WITH DEW, AND BY AND BY

WE SEE THE CONSTELLATIONS OVERHEAD.

BUT IS THAT ALL? SOME LITTLE CHILDREN CRY.

ALL WE HAVE LEFT, THEIR PEDAGOGUES REPLY.

THE TOURIST AND THE TOWN

(SAN MINIATO AL MONTE)

THOSE CLARITIES DETACHED US, GAVE US FORM,

MADE US LIKE ARCHITECTURE. NOW NO MORE

BEMUSED BY LOCAL MIST, OUR EDGES BLURRED,

WE KNEW WHERE WE BEGAN AND ENDED. THERE

WE WERE THE CAMPANILE AND THE DOME,

ALIVE AND SEPARATE IN THAT BELL-STRUCK AIR,

CLIMATE WHOSE LIGHT REFORMED OUR RANDOM LINE,

EDGED OUR INTENT AND SHARPENED OUR DESIRE.

COULD IT BE ALWAYS SO—A WEEK OF SUNLIGHT,

WALKS WITH A GUIDEBOOK, PICKING OUT OUR WAY

THROUGH VERBS AND RUINS, YET FINDING AFTER ALL

THE PROMISED VISTA, ONCE!—THE LIGHT HAS CHANGED

BEFORE WE CAN MAKE IT OURS. WE HAVE NO CHOICE:

WE ARE ONLY TOURISTS UNDER THAT BLUE SKY,

READING THE POSTERS ON THE STATION WALL—

COME, TAKE A WALKING-TRIP THROUGH HAPPINESS.

THERE IS A MYSTERY THAT FLOATS BETWEEN

THE TOURIST AND THE TOWN. IMAGINATION

ESTRANGES IT FROM HER. SHE NEED NOT SUFFER

OR DIE HERE. IT IS NONE OF HER AFFAIR,

ITS CALM HEROIC VISTAS MAKE NO CLAIM.

HER BARGAINS WITH DISASTER HAVE BEEN SEALED

IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. HERE SHE GOES UNTOUCHED,

AND THIS IS ALIENATION. ONLY SOMETIMES

IN CERTAIN TOWNS SHE OPENS CERTAIN LETTERS

FORWARDED ON FROM BITTER ORIGINS,

THAT SEND HER WALKING, SICK AND HAUNTED, THROUGH

MYSTERIOUS AND ORDINARY STREETS

THAT ARE NO MORE THAN STREETS TO WALK AND WALK—

AND THEN THE TOURIST AND THE TOWN ARE ONE.

TO WORK AND SUFFER IS TO BE AT HOME.

ALL ELSE IS SCENERY: THE RATHAUS FOUNTAIN,

THE SKATERS IN THE SUNSET ON THE LAKE

AT SALZBURG, OR, EMERGING AFTER SNOW,

THE SINGULAR CLEAR STARS AT CASTELLANE.

TO WORK AND SUFFER IS TO COME TO KNOW

THE ANGLES OF A ROOM, LIGHT IN A SQUARE,

AS CONVALESCENTS KNOW THE FACE OF ONE

WHO HAS WATCHED BESIDE THEM. YOURS NOW, EVERY STREET,

THE NOONDAY SWARM ACROSS THE BRIDGE, THE BELLS

BRUISING THE AIR ABOVE THE CROWDED ROOFS,

THE AVENUE OF CHESTNUT-TREES, THE ROAD

TO THE POST-OFFICE. ONCE UPON A TIME

ALL THESE FOR YOU WERE FICTION. NOW, MADE FREE

YOU LIVE AMONG THEM. YOUR BREATH IS ON THIS AIR,

AND YOU ARE THEIRS AND OF THEIR MYSTERY.

BEARS

WONDERFUL BEARS THAT WALKED MY ROOM ALL NIGHT,

WHERE ARE YOU GONE, YOUR SLEEK AND FAIRY FUR,

YOUR EYES’ VEILED IMPERIOUS LIGHT?

BROWN BEARS AS RICH AS MOCHA OR AS MUSK,

WHITE OPALESCENT BEARS WHOSE FUR STOOD OUT

ELECTRIC IN THE DEEPENING DUSK,

AND GREAT BLACK BEARS WHO SEEMED MORE BLUE THAN BLACK,

MORE VIOLET THAN BLUE AGAINST THE DARK—

WHERE ARE YOU NOW? UPON WHAT TRACK

MUTTER YOUR MUFFLED PAWS, THAT USED TO TREAD

SO SOFTLY, SURELY, UP THE CREAKLESS STAIR

WHILE I LAY LISTENING IN BED?

WHEN DID I LOSE YOU? WHOSE HAVE YOU BECOME?

WHY DO I WAIT AND WAIT AND NEVER HEAR

YOUR THICK NOCTURNAL PACING IN MY ROOM?

MY BEARS, WHO KEEPS YOU NOW, IN PRIDE AND FEAR?

THE INSUSCEPTIBLES

THEN THE LONG SUNLIGHT LYING ON THE SEA

FELL, FOLDED GOLD ON GOLD; AND SLOWLY WE

TOOK UP OUR DECKS OF CARDS, OUR PARASOLS,

THE PICNIC HAMPER AND THE SANDBLOWN SHAWLS

AND CLIMBED THE DUNES IN SILENCE. THERE WERE TWO

WHO LAGGED BEHIND AS LOVERS SOMETIMES DO,

AND TOOK A DIFFERENT ROAD. FOR US THE NIGHT

WAS FINAL, AND BY ARTIFICIAL LIGHT

WE CAME INDOORS TO SLEEP. NO ENVY THERE

OF THOSE WHO MIGHT BE WATCHING ANYWHERE

THE LUSTRES OF THE SUMMER DARK, TO TRACE

SOME VAGRANT SPLINTER BLAZING OUT OF SPACE.

NO THOUGHT OF THEM, SAVE IN A LOWER ROOM

TO LEAVE A LIGHT FOR THEM WHEN THEY SHOULD COME.

LUCIFER IN THE TRAIN

RIDING THE BLACK EXPRESS FROM HEAVEN TO HELL

HE BIT HIS FINGERS, WATCHED THE COUNTRYSIDE,

VERNAL AND CRYSTALLINE, FOREVER SLIDE

BEYOND HIS GAZE: THE LONG CASCADES THAT FELL

RIBBONED IN SUNSHINE FROM THEIR SPARKLING HEIGHT,

THE FISHERS FASTENED TO THEIR POOLS OF GREEN

BY SILVER LINES; THE BIRDS IN SUDDEN FLIGHT—

ALL THINGS THE DIABOLIC EYE HAD SEEN

SINCE HEAVEN’S COCKCROW. IMPERCEPTIBLY

THAT LANDSCAPE ALTERED: NOW IN PALER AIR

TREE, HILL AND ROCK STOOD OUT RESIGNED, SEVERE,

BESIDE THE STRANGLED FIELD, THE STREAM RUN DRY.

LUCIFER, WE ARE YOURS WHO STIFF AND MUTE

RIDE OUT OF WORLDS WE SHALL NOT SEE AGAIN,

AND WATCH FROM WINDOWS OF A SMOKING TRAIN

THE ASHEN PRAIRIES OF THE ABSOLUTE.

ONCE OUT OF HEAVEN, TO AN ANGEL’S EYE

WHERE IS THE BUSH OR CLOUD WITHOUT A FLAW?

WHAT BIRD BUT FEEDS UPON MORTALITY,

FLIES TO ITS YOUNG WITH CARRION IN ITS CLAW?

O FOUNDERED ANGEL, FIRST AND LONELIEST

TO TURN THIS BITTER SAND BENEATH YOUR HOE,

TEACH US, THE NEWLY-LANDED, WHAT YOU KNOW;

AFTER OUR WEARY TRANSIT, FIND US REST.

RECORDERS IN ITALY

IT WAS AMUSING ON THAT ANTIQUE GRASS,

SEATED HALFWAY BETWEEN THE GREEN AND BLUE,

TO WAKEN MUSIC GENTLE AND EXTINCT

UNDER THE OLD WALLS WHERE THE DAISIES GREW

SPRINKLED IN CINQUECENTO STYLE, AS THOUGH

ARCHANGELS MIGHT HAVE STEPPED THERE YESTERDAY.

BUT IT WAS WE, MORTAL AND YOUNG, WHO STROLLED

AND FLUTED QUAVERING MUSIC, FOR A DAY

CASUAL HEIRS OF ALL WE LOOKED UPON.

SUCH PIPERS OF THE EMERALD AFTERNOON

COULD ONLY BE THE HEIRS OF PERFECT TIME

WHEN EVERY LEAF DISTINCTLY BRUSHED WITH GOLD

LISTENED TO PRIMAVERA SPEAKING FLOWERS.

THOSE SCHERZOS STUMBLE NOW; OUR JOURNEYS RUN

TO HARSHER HILLSIDES, ROCKIER DECLENSIONS.

OBLIGATORY CLIMATES CALL US HOME.

AND SO SHALL CLARITY OF CYPRESSES,

UNFINGERED BY NECESSITY, BECOME

MERELY THE GHOST OF HALF-REMEMBERED TREES,

A TRICK OF SUNLIGHT FLATTERING THE MIND?—

THERE WERE FOUR RECORDERS SWEET UPON THE WIND.

AT HERTFORD HOUSE

PERFECTION NOW IS TENDED AND OBSERVED,

NOT USED; WE HIRE THE SPAWN OF CALIBAN

FOR DAILY SERVICE. IN OUR CAREFUL WORLD

INLAY OF PURPLE-WOOD AND TULIP, CURVED

TO MIME THE SHEEN OF PLUMES AND PEACOCKS’ EYES,

EXISTS FOR INSPECTION ONLY. AND THE JARS

OF APPLE-GREEN AND WHITE, WHERE WOOING’S DONE

IN PANELS AFTER BOUCHER—SUCH WE PRIZE

TOO WELL TO FILL WITH ROSES. CHOCOLATE, TOO,

WILL NOT AGAIN BE FROTHED IN CUPS LIKE THESE;

WE MOVE METICULOUSLY, ILL AT EASE

AMID PERFECTIONS. WHY SHOULD A PORCELAIN PLAQUE

WHERE VENUS PULLS HER POUTING ADON ON

THROUGH BEDS OF BLUSHING FLOWERS, SEEM UNFIT

FOR CASUAL THUMBPRINT? EASE IS WHAT WE LACK.

THERE’S A DIVISION NOTHING CAN MAKE SWEET

BETWEEN THE CLODS OF USAGE AND THE TOYS

WE STRUM OUR SENSES WITH. BUT ANTOINETTE

RAN HER LONG TORTOISE-SHELL AND SILVER COMB

THROUGH POWDERED YELLOW HAIR, AND WOULD HAVE LAUGHED

TO THINK THAT USE TOO MEAN FOR ART OR CRAFT.

THE WILD SKY

HERE FROM THE CORRIDOR OF AN ENGLISH TRAIN,

I SEE THE LANDSCAPE SLIDE THROUGH GLANCING RAIN,

A LAND SO PERSONAL THAT EVERY LEAF

UNFOLDS AS IF TO WITNESS HUMAN LIFE,

AND EVERY AGING MILESTONE SEEMS TO KNOW

THAT HUMAN HANDS INSCRIBED IT, LONG AGO.

OASTHOUSE AND GARDEN, NARROW BRIDGE AND HILL—

LANDSCAPE WITH FIGURES, WHERE A CHANGE OF STYLE

COMES SOFTENED IN A WATER-COLOUR LIGHT

BY CONSTABLE; AND ALWAYS, SHIRE ON SHIRE,

THE LOW-PITCHED SKY SAGS LIKE A TENT OF AIR

BENEATH ITS ANCIENT IMMATERIAL WEIGHT.

THE WEATHER IN THESE GENTLE PROVINCES

MOVES LIKE THE SHIFT OF DAYLIGHT IN A HOUSE,

SUBDUED BY TIME AND CUSTOM. SUN AND RAIN

ARE INTIMATE, COMPLAISANT TO ROUTINE,

GUESTS IN THE GARDEN. YEAR ON COUNTRY YEAR

HAS WORN THE EDGE OF WILDNESS FROM THIS AIR.

AND I REMEMBER THAT UNBLUNTED LIGHT

POURED OUT ALL DAY FROM A PRODIGIOUS HEIGHT—

MY COUNTRY, WHERE THE BLUE IS MILES TOO HIGH

FOR MINDS OF MEN TO GRAZE THE LEANING SKY.

THE TELEGRAPH MAY RISE OR TIMBER FALL,

THAT LAST FRONTIER REMAINS, THE VERTICAL.

MEN THERE ARE BEANSTALK CLIMBERS, ALL DAY LONG

HAUNTED BY STILTS THEY CLATTERED ON WHEN YOUNG.

GIANTS NO LONGER, NOW AT MORTAL SIZE

THEY STARE INTO THAT UPWARD WILDERNESS.

THE VERTICAL REMINDS THEM WHAT THEY ARE,

AND I REMEMBER I AM NATIVE THERE.

THE PROSPECT

YOU PROMISE ME WHEN CERTAIN THINGS ARE DONE

WE’LL CLOSE THESE ROOMS ABOVE A CITY SQUARE,

AND STEALING OUT BY HALF-LIGHT, WILL BE GONE

WHEN NEXT THE TELEPHONE BREAKS THE WAITING AIR.

BEFORE THEY SEND TO FIND US, WE SHALL BE

ABOARD A BLUNT-NOSED STEAMER, AT WHOSE RAIL

WE’LL WATCH THE LOADING OF THE LAST BROWN BALE

AND FEEL THE CHANNEL ROUGHENING INTO SEA.

AND AFTER MANY SUNLIT DAYS WE’LL SIGHT

THE COAST YOU TELL ME OF. ALONG THAT SHORE

RARE SHELLS LIE TUMBLED, AND THE SEAS OF LIGHT

DIP PAST THE GOLDEN ROCKS TO CRASH AND POUR

UPON THE BOWL-SHAPED BEACH. IN THAT CLEAR BAY

WE’LL SCOOP FOR PEBBLES TILL OUR FEET AND HANDS

ARE GILDED BY THE WASH OF BLENDING SANDS;

AND THOUGH THE BOAT LIFT ANCHOR, WE SHALL STAY.

YOU WILL DISCOVER IN THE WOODS BEYOND

THE CREATURES YOU HAVE LOVED ON CHINESE SILK:

THE SHELL-GRAY FOX, GAZELLES THAT AT YOUR SOUND

WILL LIFT THEIR EYES AS CALM AS GOLDEN MILK.

THE LEAVES AND GRASSES FEATHERED INTO PLUMES

WILL SHADOW-EDGE THEIR PALE CALLIGRAPHY;

AND IN THE EVENING YOU WILL COME TO ME

TO TELL OF HONEY THICK IN SILVER COMBS.

YET IN THE DRIFT OF MOMENTS UNENDEARED

BY SAMENESS, WHEN THE CRACKS OF MORNING SHOW

ONLY A REPLICA OF DAYS WE’VE MARRED

WITH STILL THE SAME OLD PENANCES TO DO,

IN FURNISHED ROOMS ABOVE A CITY SQUARE,

EATING THE RIND OF FACT, I SOMETIMES DREAD

THE PROMISE OF THAT HONEY-BREEDING AIR,

THOSE UNAPPORTIONED CLUSTERS OVERHEAD.

EPILOGUE FOR A
MASQUE OF PURCELL

BEAST AND BIRD MUST BOW ASIDE,

GRIMBALD LIMP INTO THE WINGS.

ALL THAT’S LOVELY AND ABSURD,

ALL THAT DANCES, ALL THAT SINGS

FOLDED INTO TRUNKS AGAIN—

THE HAUNTED GROVE, THE STARLIT AIR—

ALL TURNS WORKADAY AND PLAIN,

EVEN THE HAPPY, HAPPY PAIR.

HARPSICHORD AND TRUMPET GO

TRUNDLING DOWN THE DUSTY HALL.

THAT AIRY JOY, THAT POSTURED WOE

LIKE THE BLACK MAGICIAN’S SPELL

FALL IN PIECES ROUND US NOW,

WHILE THE DANCER GOES TO LIE

WITH THE KING, AND NEED NOT KNOW

HE WILL JILT HER BY AND BY.

WE WERE YOUNG ONCE AND ARE OLD;

HAVE SEEN THE DRAGON DIE BEFORE;

KNEW THE INNOCENT AND BOLD,

SAW THEM THROUGH THE CARDBOARD DOOR

KISS THE GUILTY AND AFRAID,

TURNING HUMAN SOON ENOUGH.

WE HAVE WEPT WITH THE BETRAYED,

NEVER KNOWN THEM DIE FOR LOVE.

YET, SINCE NOTHING’S DONE BY HALVES

WHILE ILLUSION’S YET TO DO,

MAY WE STILL FORGIVE OURSELVES,

AND DANCE AGAIN WHEN TRUMPETS BLOW.

VILLA ADRIANA

WHEN THE COLOSSUS OF THE WILL’S DOMINION

WAVERS AND SHRINKS UPON A DYING EYE,

ENORMOUS SHADOWS SIT LIKE BIRDS OF PREY,

WAITING TO FALL WHERE BLISTERED MARBLES LIE.

BUT IN ITS OPEN POOLS THE PLACE ALREADY

LAY RUINED, BEFORE THE OLD KING LEFT IT FREE.

SHATTERED IN WATERS OF EACH MARBLE BASIN

HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN IT AS TODAY WE SEE.

DYING IN DISCONTENT, HE MUST HAVE KNOWN

HOW, ONCE MERE CONSCIOUSNESS HAD TURNED ITS BACK,

THE FRESCOES OF HIS APPETITE WOULD CRUMBLE,

THE FOUNTAINS OF HIS LONGING YAWN AND CRACK.

AND ALL HIS GENIUS WOULD BECOME A RIDDLE,

HIS PERFECT COLONNADES AT LAST ATTAIN

THE INCOMPLETENESS OF A NATURAL THING;

HIS IMPULSE TURN TO MYSTERY AGAIN.

WHO SLEEPS, AND DREAMS, AND WAKES, AND SLEEPS AGAIN

MAY DREAM AGAIN; SO IN THE END WE COME

BACK TO THE CHERISHED AND CONSUMING SCENE

AS IF FOR ONCE THE STONES WILL NOT BE DUMB.

WE COME LIKE DREAMERS SEARCHING FOR AN ANSWER,

PASSIONATELY IN NEED TO RECONSTRUCT

THE COLUMNED ROOFS UNDER THE BLAZING SKY,

THE COURTS SO OPEN, SO FOREVER LOCKED.

AND SOME OF US, AS DREAMERS, EXCAVATE

UNDER THE BLANCHING LIGHT OF SLEEP’S HIGH NOON,

THE ARTIFACTS OF THOUGHT, THE SITE OF LOVE,

WHOSE HADRIAN HAS GIVEN THE SLIP, AND GONE.

THE EXPLORERS

BESIDE THE MARE CRISIUM, THAT SEA

WHERE WATER NEVER WAS, SIT DOWN WITH ME,

AND LET US TALK OF EARTH, WHERE LONG AGO

WE DRANK THE AIR AND SAW THE RIVERS FLOW

LIKE COMETS THROUGH THE GREEN ESTATES OF MAN,

AND FRUIT THE COLOUR OF ALDEBARAN

WEIGHTED THE CURVING BOUGHS. THE ROUTE OF STARS

WAS OUR DIVERSION, AND THE FATE OF MARS

OUR GRAVE CONCERN; WE STARED THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT

ON THESE UNCOLONIZED DEMESNES OF LIGHT.

WE READ OF STARS ESCAPING NEWTON’S CHAIN

TILL ONLY AUTOGRAPHS OF FIRE REMAIN;

WE AIMED OUR MORTAL SEARCHLIGHTS INTO SPACE

AS IF IN HOPES TO FIND A MORTAL FACE.

O LITTLE EARTH, OUR VILLAGE, WHERE THE DAY

SEEMED ALL TOO BRIEF, AND STARLIGHT WOULD NOT STAY,

WE WERE PROVINCIALS ON THE GRAND EXPRESS

THAT WHIRLED US INTO DARK AND LONELINESS.

WE THOUGHT TO BRING YOU WONDER WITH A TALE

HUGER THAN THOSE THAT TURNED OUR FATHERS PALE.

HERE IN THIS LUNAR NIGHT WE WATCH ALONE

LONGER THAN EVER MEN HAVE WATCHED FOR DAWN.

BEYOND THIS METEOR-BITTEN PLAIN WE SEE

MORE STARRY SYSTEMS THAN YOU DREAM TO BE,

AND WHILE THEIR CLOCKWORK BLAZES OVERHEAD,

WE SPEAK THE NAMES WE LEARNED AS WE WERE BRED,

WE TELL OF PLACES SEEN EACH DAY FROM BIRTH—

OBSCURE AND LOCAL, PATOIS OF THE EARTH!

O RACE OF FARMERS, PLOWING YEAR BY YEAR

THE SAME FEW FIELDS, I SOMETIMES SEEM TO HEAR

THE FAR-OFF ECHO OF A CATTLE-BELL

AGAINST THE CRATERED CLIFF OF ARZACHEL,

AND WEEP TO THINK NO SOUND CAN EVER COME

ACROSS THAT OUTER DESERT, FROM MY HOME.

LANDSCAPE OF THE STAR

THE SILENCE OF THE YEAR. THIS HOUR THE STREETS

LIE EMPTY, AND THE CLASH OF BELLS IS SCATTERED

OUT TO THE EDGE OF STARS. I HEARD THEM TELL

MORNING’S FIRST CHANGE AND CLANG THE PEOPLE HOME

FROM CRÈCHE AND SCENTED AISLE. COME HOME, COME HOME,

I HEARD THE BELLS OF CHRISTMAS CALL AND DIE.

THIS CHRISTMAS MORNING, IN THE STONY STREETS

OF AN UNACCUSTOMED CITY, WHERE THE GAS

QUIVERS AGAINST THE DARKLY-SHUTTERED WALLS,

I WALK, MY BREATH A VEIL UPON THE COLD,

NO LONGER SICK FOR HOME NOR HUNTED DOWN

BY FACES LOVED, BY GATE OR SILL OR TREE

THAT ONCE I USED TO WREATHE IN RED AND SILVER

UNDER THE SPLINTERED INCENSE OF THE FIR.

I THINK OF THOSE INSCRUTABLES WHO TOILED,

HEAVY AND BROODING IN THEIR CAMEL-TRAIN,

ACROSS THE BLUE-WRAPPED STRETCHES. HOME BEHIND,

KINGDOMS DEPARTED FROM, THE SOLEMN JOURNEY

THEIR ONLY RESIDENCE: THE STARLIT HOUR,

THE LANDSCAPE OF THE STAR, THEIR TIME AND PLACE.

O TO BE ONE OF THEM, AND FEEL THE SWAY

OF ROCKING CAMEL THROUGH THE JUDAEAN SAND,—

RIDE, WRAPPED IN SWATHES OF DAMASK AND OF SILK,

HEAR THE FAINT RING OF JEWEL IN SILVER MESH

STARRING THE SILENCE OF THE PLAIN; AND HOLD

WITH RIGID FINGERS CURVED AS IN OBLATION

THE GOLDEN JAR OF MYRRH AGAINST THE KNEES.

TO RIDE THUS, BEARING GIFTS TO A STRANGE LAND,

TO A STRANGE KING; NOR THINK OF FEAR AND ENVY,

BEING SO BEMUSED BY STARLIGHT OF ONE STAR,

THE LONG UNBROKEN JOURNEY, THAT ALL QUESTIONS

SINK LIKE THE LESSER LIGHTS BEHIND THE HILLS;

THINK NEITHER OF THE END IN SIGHT, NOR ALL

THAT LIES BEHIND, BUT DREAMLESSLY TO RIDE,

TRAVELLER AT ONE WITH TRAVELLED COUNTRYSIDE.

HOW ELSE, SINCE FOR THOSE MAGI AND THEIR TRAIN

THE PALACES BEHIND HAVE CEASED TO BE

HOME, AND THE HOME THEY TRAVEL TOWARD IS STILL

BUT RUMOR STOKING FEAR IN HEROD’S BRAIN?

WHAT ELSE FOR THEM BUT THIS, SINCE NEVER MORE

CAN COURTS AND STATES RECEIVE THEM AS THEY WERE,

NOR HAVE THE TRAMPLED EARTH, THE ROOF OF STRAW

RECEIVED THE KINGS AS THEY ARE YET TO BE?

THE BELLS ARE SILENT, SILENCED IN MY MIND

AS ON THE DARK. I WALK, A FOREIGNER,

UPON THIS NIGHT THAT CALLS ALL TRAVELLERS HOME,

THE PRODIGAL FORGIVEN, AND THE BREACH

MENDED FOR THIS ONE FEAST. YET ALL ARE STRANGE

TO THEIR OWN ENDS, AND THEIR BEGINNINGS NOW

CANNOT CONTAIN THEM. ONCE-FAMILIAR SPEECH

BABBLES IN WAYWARD DIALECT OF A DREAM.

OUR GIFTS SHALL BRING US HOME: NOT TO BEGINNINGS

NOR ALWAYS TO THE DESTINATION NAMED

UPON OUR SETTING-FORTH. OUR GIFTS COMPEL,

MASTER OUR WAYS AND LEAD US IN THE END

WHERE WE ARE MOST OURSELVES; WHETHER AT LAST

TO SOLOMON’S GAZE OR SHEBA’S SILKEN KNEES

OR WINTER PASTURES UNDERNEATH A STAR,

WHERE ANGELS SPRING LIKE STARLIGHT IN THE TREES.

LETTER FROM THE LAND
OF SINNERS

I WRITE YOU THIS OUT OF ANOTHER PROVINCE

THAT YOU MAY NEVER SEE:

COUNTRY OF RIVERS, ITS TOPOGRAPHY

MUTABLE IN DETAIL, YET ALWAYS ONE,

BLASTED IN CERTAIN PLACES, HERE BY GLACIERS,

THERE BY THE WORK OF MAN.

THE FISHERS BY THE WATER HAVE NO BOAST

SAVE OF THEIR FREEDOM; HERE

A MAN MAY CAST A DOZEN KINDS OF LURE

AND THINK HIS DAYS REWARDED IF HE SIGHT

NOW AND AGAIN THE PRIZE, UNNETTED, FLICKING

ITS PRISM-GLEAMS OF LIGHT.

THE OLD LORD LIVED SECLUDED IN HIS PARK

UNTIL THE HALL WAS BURNED

YEARS AGO, BY HIS TENANTS; BOTH HAVE LEARNED

BETTER SINCE THEN, AND NOW OUR CHILDREN RUN

TO GREET HIM. QUAIL AND HUNTER HAVE FORGOTTEN

THE ECHO OF THE GUN.

I SAID THERE ARE BLASTED PLACES: WE HAVE KEPT

THEIR NAKEDNESS INTACT—

NO MARBLE TO COMMEMORATE AN ACT

SUPERHUMAN OR MERELY RASH; WE KNOW

WHY THEY ARE THERE AND WHY THE SEED THAT FALLS THERE

IS CERTAIN NOT TO GROW.

WE KEEP THESE PLACES AS WE KEEP THE TIME

SCARRED ON OUR RECOLLECTION

WHEN SOME WE LOVED BROKE FROM US IN DEFECTION,

OR WE OURSELVES HARRIED TO DEATH TOO SOON

WHAT WE COULD LEAST FORGO. OUR MEMORIES

RECUR LIKE THE OLD MOON.

BUT WE HAVE MADE ANOTHER KIND OF PEACE,

AND WALK WHERE BOUGHS ARE GREEN,

FORGIVEN BY THE SELVES THAT WE HAVE BEEN,

AND LEARNING TO FORGIVE. OUR APPLES TASTE

SWEETER THIS YEAR; OUR GATES ARE FALLING DOWN,

AND NEED NOT BE REPLACED.

CONCORD RIVER

THE TURTLES ON THE LEDGES OF JULY

HEARD OUR APPROACH AND SPLASHED. NOW IN THE MUD

LIE LIKE THE MEMORY OF FECUND SUMMER

THEIR BURIED EGGS. THE RIVER, COLDER NOW,

HAS OTHER, AUTUMN TALES TO CARRY ON

BETWEEN THE BANKS WHERE LOVERS USED TO LIE.

LOVERS, OR BOYS ESCAPED FROM YARD AND FARM

TO DROWN IN SENSUAL PURITIES OF SUN—

NO MATTER WHICH; FOR SINGLE FISHERMAN

CASTING INTO THE SHADE, OR THOSE ABSORBED

IN HUMAN ARDOR, SUMMER WAS THE SAME,

IMPERVIOUS TO WEARINESS OR ALARM.

THE FISHERMAN, BY CRAFT AND LOVE REMOVED

FROM MEANNESS, HAS AN ALMANAC AT HOME

SAYING THE SEASON WILL BE BRIEF THIS YEAR

AND ICE STRIKE EARLY; YET UPON ITS SHELF

THE BOOK IS NO DESPOILER OF THIS DAY

IN WHICH HE MOVES AND PONDERS, MOST HIMSELF.

THAT BOY, WATCHING FOR TURTLES BY THE SHORE,

STEEPED IN HIS SATISFACTORY LONELINESS,

IF ASKED COULD TELL US THAT THE SUN WOULD SET,

OR AUTUMN DRIVE HIM BACK TO GAMES AND SCHOOL—

TELL US AT SECOND-HAND, BELIEVING THEN

ONLY MIDSUMMER AND THE NOONSTRUCK POOL.

AND WE, WHO FLOATED THROUGH THE SUNLIT GREEN,

INDOLENT, VOLUNTARY AS THE DANCE

OF DRAGON-FLIES ABOVE THE SKIMMING LEAVES—

FOR US THE LANDSCAPE AND THE HOUR BECAME

A SINGLE ELEMENT, WHERE OUR DRIFTING SILENCE

FELL TWOFOLD, LIKE OUR SHADOWS ON THE WATER.

THIS IS THE CONCORD RIVER, WHERE THE ICE

WILL HOLD TILL APRIL: THIS IS THE WILLOWED STREAM

MUCH THREADED BY THE NATIVE COGITATORS

WHO WROTE THEIR JOURNALS CALMLY BY ITS SHORE,

OBSERVING WEATHER AND THE SWING OF SEASONS

ALONG WITH PERSONAL COSMOLOGIES.

HENRY THOREAU MOST NEARLY LEARNED TO LIVE

WITHIN A WORLD HIS SOUL COULD RECOGNIZE—

UNSHAKEN BY ACCOUNTS OF ANY COUNTRY

HE COULD NOT TOUCH WITH BOTH HIS HANDS. HE SAW

THE RIVER MOVING PAST THE PROVINCIAL TOWN

AND KNEW EACH CURVE OF SHORELINE FOR HIS OWN.

HE TRAVELLED MUCH, HE SAID—HIS WAYWARD SPEECH

SOUNDING ALWAYS A LITTLE INSOLENT,

YET SURER THAN THE REST; THEY, LIKE OURSELVES,

RAN OFF TO DABBLE IN A WORLD BEYOND,

WHILE HE EXALTED THE GEOGRAPHY

HE LIVED EACH DAY: A RIVER AND A POND.

FOR HIM THERE WAS NO TURNING OF THE EAR

TO RUMORED URGENCIES THAT SOUGHT TO ROUSE

THE FISHER FROM HIS POOL, THE SERIOUS CHILD

FROM HIS UNCONSCIOUS WANDERING: THE SOUND

OF DESPERATE ENTERPRISES RANG TO HIM

FICTIVE AS GHOSTS UPON OLD INDIAN GROUND.

LOVER AND CHILD AND FISHERMAN, ALIKE

HAVE IN THEIR TIME BEEN NATIVE TO THIS SHORE

AS HE WOULD HAVE IT PEOPLED: ALL ENTRANCED

BY SUCH CONCERNS IN THEIR PERFECTED HOUR

THAT IN THEIR LIVES THE RIVER AND THE TREE

ARE ABSOLUTES, NO LONGER SCENERY.

APOLOGY

YOU, INVINCIBLY YOURSELF,

HAVE NOTHING LEFT TO SAY.

THE STONES UPON THE MOUNTAINSIDE

ARE NOT MORE FREE,

BEARING ALL QUESTION, ALL REPROACH

WITHOUT REPLY.

THE DEAD, WHO KEEP THEIR PEACE INTACT,

ALTHOUGH THEY KNOW

MUCH WE MIGHT BE GAINERS BY,

ARE PROUD LIKE YOU—

OR, IF THEY SPOKE, MIGHT SOUND AS YOU

SOUNDED JUST NOW.

FOR EVERY ANGRY, SIMPLE MAN

THE WORD IS BUT

A SHADOW, AND HIS MOTIVE GROWS

MORE STILL AND GREAT

WHILE THE WORLD HUMS AROUND HIM, WILD

THAT HE SHOULD EXPLICATE.

AND SOCRATES, WHOSE CRYSTAL TONGUE

PERTURBS US NOW,

LEFT ALL UNSATISFIED; THE WORD

CAN NEVER SHOW

REASON ENOUGH FOR WHAT A MAN

KNOWS HE MUST DO.

YOU TOLD US LITTLE, AND ARE DONE.

SO MIGHT THE DEAD

BEGIN TO SPEAK OF DYING, THEN

LEAVE HALF UNSAID.

SILENCE LIKE THUNDER BEARS ITS OWN

EXCUSE FOR DREAD.

LIVING IN SIN

SHE HAD THOUGHT THE STUDIO WOULD KEEP ITSELF;

NO DUST UPON THE FURNITURE OF LOVE.

HALF HERESY, TO WISH THE TAPS LESS VOCAL,

THE PANES RELIEVED OF GRIME. A PLATE OF PEARS,

A PIANO WITH A PERSIAN SHAWL, A CAT

STALKING THE PICTURESQUE AMUSING MOUSE

HAD RISEN AT HIS URGING.

NOT THAT AT FIVE EACH SEPARATE STAIR WOULD WRITHE

UNDER THE MILKMAN’S TRAMP; THAT MORNING LIGHT

SO COLDLY WOULD DELINEATE THE SCRAPS

OF LAST NIGHT’S CHEESE AND THREE SEPULCHRAL BOTTLES;

THAT ON THE KITCHEN SHELF AMONG THE SAUCERS

A PAIR OF BEETLE-EYES WOULD FIX HER OWN—

ENVOY FROM SOME VILLAGE IN THE MOLDINGS …

MEANWHILE, HE, WITH A YAWN,

SOUNDED A DOZEN NOTES UPON THE KEYBOARD,

DECLARED IT OUT OF TUNE, SHRUGGED AT THE MIRROR,

RUBBED AT HIS BEARD, WENT OUT FOR CIGARETTES;

WHILE SHE, JEERED BY THE MINOR DEMONS,

PULLED BACK THE SHEETS AND MADE THE BED AND FOUND

A TOWEL TO DUST THE TABLE-TOP,

AND LET THE COFFEE-POT BOIL OVER ON THE STOVE.

BY EVENING SHE WAS BACK IN LOVE AGAIN,

THOUGH NOT SO WHOLLY BUT THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT

SHE WOKE SOMETIMES TO FEEL THE DAYLIGHT COMING

LIKE A RELENTLESS MILKMAN UP THE STAIRS.

AUTUMN EQUINOX

THE LEAVES THAT SHIFTED OVERHEAD ALL SUMMER

ARE MARKED FOR EARTH NOW, AND I BRING THE BASKETS

STILL DARK WITH CLINGINGS OF ANOTHER SEASON

UP FROM THE CELLAR. ALL THE HOUSE IS STILL,

NOW THAT I’VE LEFT IT. LYMAN IN HIS STUDY

PEERS ON A PAGE OF DRYDEN BY THE WINDOW,

EYES ALONE MOVING, LIKE A MENDED QUAINT

PIECE OF OLD CLOCKWORK. WHEN THE AFTERNOON

TRAILS INTO HALF-LIGHT, HE WILL NEVER NOTICE

UNTIL I COME INDOORS TO LIGHT THE LAMPS

AND ROUSE HIM BLINKING FROM THE BROWNISH TYPE,

THE GILT AND TARNISHED SPINE OF VOLUME FIVE

OUT OF THE GLASS-DOORED CABINET IN THE HALL.

WHY SATIRES, I HAVE WONDERED? FOR I’VE SEEN

THE TITLE-PAGE, AND RIFFLED THROUGH THE VOLUME,

WHEN HE WAS GONE. I THOUGHT THAT GROWING OLD

RETURNED ONE TO A VAGUE ARCADIAN LONGING,

TO OVID, SPENSER, SOMETHING GOLDEN-AGED,

SOME INCORRUPTIBLE MYTH THAT TINGED THE YEARS

WITH PASTORAL FLAVOURS. LYMAN, TOO, AS GENTLE

AS AN OLD SHEPHERD, HALF-APOLOGETIC

WHEN I COME BUSTLING TO DISTURB HIS DREAMS—

WHAT IN THAT BITTERNESS CAN SPEAK TO HIM

OR HELP HIM DOWN THESE FINAL SLOPING DECADES

WITH KINDLY ARM? I’VE NEVER BEEN A SCHOLAR—

READER, PERHAPS AT TIMES, BUT NOT A SCHOLAR,

NOT IN THE WAY THAT LYMAN USED TO BE—

AND YET I KNOW THERE’S ACID ON THE PAGE

HE PORES—THAT LEAST ACIDULOUS OF MEN.

WHILE I, WHO SPENT MY YOUTH AND MIDDLE-AGE

IN STUBBORNNESS AND RAILING, PASS THE TIME

NOW, AFTER FIFTY, RAKING IN THE SUN

THE LEAVES THAT SPRINKLE SLOWLY ON THE GRASS,

AND FEEL THEIR GOLD LIKE FIRELIGHT AT MY BACK,

IN SLOW PREOCCUPATION WITH SEPTEMBER.

SOMETIMES I CALL ACROSS TO ALICE HUME

AND MEET HER AT THE FENCE AS WOMEN MEET

TO SAY THE WEATHER’S SEASONABLY FINE,

TALK HUSBANDS, BARGAINS, OR PHILOSOPHIZE—

THE DRY PHILOSOPHY OF NEIGHBORHOOD.

SHE THINKS PERHAPS HOW SHARP OF TONGUE AND QUICK

I USED TO BE, AND HOW I’VE QUIETED DOWN,

WITHOUT THOSE AIRS BECAUSE I’D MARRIED LYMAN,

PROFESSOR AT THE COLLEGE, WHILE HER HUSBAND

WAS JUST ANOTHER FARMER. THAT WAS PRIDE

AS RAW AND SILLY AS THE GIRL I WAS—

READING TOO MUCH, SNEERING AT OTHER GIRLS

WHOSE LEARNING WAS OF COOKERY AND FLIRTATION.

FATHER WOULD HAVE ME CLEVER, SOMETIMES SAID

HE’D LET ME TRAIN FOR MEDICINE, LIKE A SON,

TO COME INTO HIS PRACTICE. SO I STUDIED

GERMAN AND BOTANY, AND HATED BOTH.

WHAT GOOD FOR ME TO KNOW THE LATIN NAME

FOR HUCKLEBERRY, WHILE THE OTHERS CLIMBED

TO PICK THE FRUIT AND KISSED ACROSS THE BUSHES?

I NEVER WAS A SCHOLAR, BUT I HAD

A WOMAN’S LOVE FOR MEN OF INTELLECT,

A WOMAN’S NEED FOR LOVE OF ANY KIND.

SO LYMAN CAME TO ASK ME OF MY FATHER:

STIFF-COLLARED, SHY, NOT QUITE THE MAN I’D DREAMED—

(BYRON AND MATTHEW ARNOLD VAGUELY MINGLED

WITHOUT THE DISADVANTAGES OF EITHER.)

AND YET HE SEEMED SUPERB IN HIS REFUSAL

TO READ ALOUD FROM BRYANT TO THE LADIES

ASSEMBLED ON THE BOARDING-HOUSE PIAZZA

AMONG THE MOTH-WINGS OF A SUMMER EVENING.

HIS QUICK WITHDRAWAL WON MY HEART. I SMILE

SOMETIMES TO THINK WHAT QUIRKS OF VANITY

PROPEL US TOWARD OUR CHOICES IN THE END.

THE WEDDING-PICTURE IN THE BUREAU DRAWER

HAS ON THE BACK IN LYMAN’S MEASURED WRITING:

“SEPTEMBER TWENTY-SECOND, NINETEEN-TWELVE.”

I KEEP IT IN ITS FOLDER, DECKLE-EDGED

AND YELLOWING. I SEE MYSELF AGAIN,

CORRECT AND TERRIFIED ON OUR WEDDING-DAY,

WEARING THE LACE MY MOTHER WORE BEFORE ME

AND BUTTONED SHOES THAT PINCHED. I FEEL AGAIN

THE TREMBLING OF MY HAND IN LYMAN’S FINGERS,

AWKWARDLY HELD IN THAT UNGAINLY POSE

WHILE AUNTS AROUND US NODDED LIKE THE FATES

THAT NEMESIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED. LYMAN STOOD

SO THIN AND MINISTERIAL IN HIS BLACK,

I THOUGHT HE LOOKED A STRANGER. IN THE PICTURE

WE ARE THE SEMBLANCE OF A BRIDE AND GROOM

STATIC AS FIGURES ON A MANTELPIECE,

AS IF THAT MOMENT OUT OF TIME EXISTED

THEN AND FOREVER IN A DOME OF GLASS,

WHERE NEITHER DUST NOR THE EXPLORING FLY

COULD SPECK ITS DRY IMMUTABILITY.

THUS I BECAME HIS PARTNER IN A LIFE

ANNUAL, ACADEMIC; WE OBSERVED

EVENTS MOMENTOUS AS THE CEREMONY

TO DEDICATE THE CHAPEL CARILLON

(MEMORIAL TO EDWARD STEPHENS HODGE,

CLASS OF NINETEEN-FOURTEEN). THERE WE HEARD

THOSE SOUNDS CONVERGE UPON THE RURAL AIR

THAT SOON BECAME FAMILIAR AS A HINGE

CREAKING AND NEVER SILENCED. IN OUR MEADOW

THE ANGULAR YOUNG TOOK UP THEIR BATS AND SHOUTED

THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON, WHILE I WAS POURING

TEA FOR THE DEAN’S ARTHRITIC WIFE. FOR LYMAN

THE WORLD WAS ALL THE DISTANCE HE PURSUED

FROM HOME TO LECTURE-ROOM, AND HOME AGAIN,

EXCHANGING NODS WITH COLLEAGUES, SMILING VAGUELY

UPON A SHIRTSLEEVED TRIO, TANNED AND JOSTLING,

WHO GRINNED AND GAVE HIM ROOM UPON THE PATH.

I BIT MY FINGERS, CHANGED THE PARLOR CURTAINS

TO ONES THE LIKE OF WHICH WERE NEVER SEEN

ALONG OUR GRAVE AND ACADEMIC STREET.

I BROUGHT THEM HOME FROM SPRINGFIELD IN A BUNDLE

AND HUNG THEM IN DEFIANCE. I TOOK A WALK

ACROSS THE FIELDS ONE HEAVY SUMMER NIGHT

UNTIL THE COLLEGE FROM A MILE AWAY

LOOKED SALLOW, INSIGNIFICANT IN THE MOONLIGHT.

IT SEEMED THE MOON MUST SHINE ON FINER THINGS

I HAD NOT SEEN, THINGS THAT COULD SHOW WITH PRIDE

BENEATH THAT SILVER GLOBE. ALONG THE WALLS

OF LYMAN’S STUDY THERE WERE STEEL ENGRAVINGS

FRAMED IN BLACK OAK: THE CRAZY TOWER OF PISA,

THE PYRAMIDS, ROOTED IN DESERT SAND,

COLOGNE CATHEDRAL WITH ITS DANGEROUS SPIRES

PIERCING THE ATMOSPHERE. I HATED THEM

FOR PRIGGISHLY ENCLOSING IN A ROOM

THE MARVELS OF THE WORLD, AS IF DECLARING

SUCH WAS THE RIGHT AND FITTING RÔLE OF MARVELS.

NIGHT, AND I WEPT ALOUD; HALF IN MY SLEEP,

HALF FEELING LYMAN’S WONDER AS HE LEANED

ABOVE TO SHAKE ME. “ARE YOU ILL, UNHAPPY?

TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO.”

“I’M SICK, I GUESS—

I THOUGHT THAT LIFE WAS DIFFERENT THAN IT IS.”

“TELL ME WHAT’S WRONG. WHY CAN’T YOU EVER SAY?

I’M HERE, YOU KNOW.”

HALF SHAMED, I TURNED TO SEE

THE LINES OF GRIEVOUS LOVE UPON HIS FACE,

THE LOVE THAT GROPES AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND.

“I MUST BE CRAZY, LYMAN—OR A DREAM

HAS MADE ME BABBLE THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT.

GO BACK TO SLEEP—I WON’T BE SO AGAIN.”

YOUNG LOVERS TALK OF GIVING ALL THE HEART

INTO EACH OTHERS’ TRUST: THEIR RHETORIC

WON’T STAND FOR ANALYZING, I’M AWARE,

BUT HAVE THEY THOUGHT OF THIS: THAT EACH MUST KNOW

BEYOND A DOUBT WHAT’S GIVEN, WHAT RECEIVED?

NOW WE ARE OLD LIKE NATURE; PATIENT, STAID,

UNHURRIED FROM THE YEAR’S WELLWORN ROUTINE,

WE WAKE AND TAKE THE DAY FOR WHAT IT IS,

AND SLEEP AS CALMLY AS THE DEAD WHO KNOW

THEY’LL WAKE TO THEIR REWARD. WE HAVE BECOME

AS UNSELFCONSCIOUS AS A PAIR OF TREES,

NOT QUESTIONING, BUT LIVING. EVEN AUTUMN

CAN ONLY CARRY THROUGH WHAT SPRING BEGAN.

WHAT ELSE COULD HAPPEN NOW BUT LOSS OF LEAF

AND RAIN UPON THE BOUGHS? SO I HAVE THOUGHT,

AND WONDERED FAINTLY WHERE THE THOUGHT BEGAN,

AND WHEN THE IRRITABLE GUST OF YOUTH

STOPPED TURNING EVERY BLADE OF GRASS TO FIND

A NEW DISSATISFACTION. MEANWHILE LYMAN

READS SATIRE IN THE FALLING AFTERNOON—

A CHANGE FOR HIM AS WELL. WE FINISH OFF

NOT QUITE AS WE BEGAN. I HEAR THE BELLS

WANDERING THROUGH THE AIR ACROSS THE FIELDS.

I’VE RAKED THREE BUSHEL BASKETS FULL OF LEAVES—

ENOUGH FOR ONE SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON.

THE STRAYED VILLAGE

HE HAD COME NEARLY HALF A THOUSAND MILES,

AND THEN TO FIND IT GONE … HE KNEW TOO WELL

EVER TO BE MISTAKEN, WHERE THE HILLS

DIPPED TO REVEAL IT FIRST: THE LINE OF CHIMNEYS

REFLECTED IN THE UNIMPORTANT STREAM,

THE MONUMENT, WORTH HALF A LINE IN GUIDEBOOKS—

“TOWER OF A CHURCH THAT CROMWELL’S ARMY BURNED,

FINE EARLY PERPENDICULAR”—ITSELF

SUBSERVIENT NEITHER TO THEOLOGIES

NOR CHANGING STYLES OF ARCHITECTURE, STILL

A CIPHER ON THE LANDSCAPE, SOMETHING CLEAR

IN THAT UNOSTENTATIOUS SCENERY.

WELL, IF THE TOWER WAS GONE—AND WHO SHOULD SAY,

DEPEND ON ANY LANDMARK TO REMAIN?

HE HAD BEEN TOO FAR AND KNOWN TOO MANY LOSSES

NOT TO BE RECONCILED THAT EVEN LANDMARKS

GO OUT LIKE MATCHES WHEN YOU NEED THEM MOST.

SO IT COULD BE WITH THIS. BUT NOT A HOUSE,

NOT ANYTHING REFLECTED IN THE RIVER

BUT WILLOWS THAT COULD GROW BY ANY RIVER,

FEMININE, NON-COMMITTAL IN THEIR POSTURES.

WILLOWS: A BRIDGE THEN? BUT THE BRIDGE WAS GONE,

THE PILES HAD LEFT NO TRACE, NO SIGNATURE

OF STONES BESIDE THE WATER. IF, INDEED,

THERE EVER HAD BEEN BRIDGE OR TOWER OR HOUSE.

THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT ENFOREIGNED HIM,

BRUSHED FORTY YEARS OF MEMORY ASIDE

AND MADE OF HIM ANOTHER OBTUSE TRIPPER

STARING AT SIGNPOSTS TO BE REASSURED:

THIS IS THE PLACE—WHERE I GREW INTO MANHOOD,

THE PLACE I HAD TO LEAVE WHEN I WAS GROWN?

SO OFTEN HE HAD THOUGHT A MAN’S WHOLE LIFE

MOST RIGHTLY COULD BE WRITTEN, LIKE HIS OWN,

IN TERMS OF PLACES HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE

BECAUSE THEIR MEANING, PASSING THAT OF PERSONS,

BECAME TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

“THIS IS THE PLACE?”

HE HEARD HIMSELF DEMAND; AND HEARD THE OTHER—

A YOUTHFUL RECTOR, BY THE LOOK OF HIM,

PAUSING UPON HIS EVENING STROLL—REPLY,

“OH, YES, THIS IS THE PLACE…. THE VILLAGE WENT,

AS I SHOULD RECKON, TWENTY YEARS AGO.

ACROSS THE HILL, IN OUR TOWN, THERE WAS ONCE

TALK AND CONJECTURE; NOW YOU MIGHT SUPPOSE

ONLY THE ANTIQUARIANS BREATHE ITS NAME.

THE MEMORY OF MAN, MY FRIEND, IS SHORT.”

“SHORTER AND LONGER THAN IT’S CREDITED,”

HE ANSWERED; “BUT YOU SAY THE VILLAGE WENT?

I HARDLY CARE TO ASK, AND YET I ASK—

BY FLOOD? BY FIRE? THERE USED TO BE A TOWER

THAT CROMWELL’S ZEALOTS FAILED TO BULLY DOWN.

BUT THERE’S NO MARK. IT WENT? HOW DID IT GO?”

“IT WENT AWAY. YOU’VE HEARD OF MEN WHO WENT,

SUDDENLY, WITHOUT PARTINGS OR ANNULMENTS,

NOT CARRIED OFF BY ACCIDENT OR DEATH,

BUT SIMPLY STRAYED? THAT WAS THE WAY IT WENT.

WE WENT TO BED ON THURSDAY AND COULD HEAR

THE BELLS, AS USUAL ON A QUIET NIGHT,

ACROSS THE HILL BETWEEN. ON FRIDAY MORNING

THERE WERE NO BELLS. THERE WASN’T ANYTHING.

THE LANDSCAPE STOOD AS IF SINCE MAGNA CARTA,

EMPTY, AS IT STANDS NOW. THE VILLAGE HAD GONE,

QUITE WITHOUT TAKING LEAVE. STRAYED, IS THE WORD

WE FOUND OURSELVES AS IF BY ACQUIESCENCE

USING TO SPEAK OF IT, AS IF WE THOUGHT

SOMEDAY TO COME UPON IT SOMEWHERE ELSE

AND GREET OUR FORMER NEIGHBORS AS BEFORE.

NO ONE HAS EVER FOUND IT, THOUGH. ONE CAN’T

ADVERTISE FOR A VILLAGE THAT HAS STRAYED:

‘LOST, WITH ONE EARLY PERPENDICULAR TOWER,

A VILLAGE NUMBERING FOUR HUNDRED SOULS,

WITH STONE AND WOODEN FOOTBRIDGE.’ AND, AS I SAY,

MEN’S MEMORIES GROW SHORT LIKE WINTER DAYLIGHT.

SO MUCH GETS STRAYED THAT HAS TO BE REPLACED—

DOGS, WITS, AFFECTIONS …”

“YES, SO MUCH GETS STRAYED;

BUT ONE OF ALL THE THINGS A MAN CAN LOSE

I THOUGHT WOULD KEEP TILL I COULD COME AGAIN.

IT ALMOST SEEMS IT WENT LEST I SHOULD COME,

BECAUSE I ALWAYS PROMISED I WOULD COME,

AND HAD THIS LATEST PENALTY IN STORE,

THE LAST OF LOSSES.”

SO HE SAID GOODBYE,

AND WATCHED THE LITTLE RECTOR CLIMB THE HILL

BACK TO HIS PARISH TOWN. THE STREAM RAN ON,

AND ALL THAT WALKING WAS TO DO AGAIN.

THE PERENNIAL ANSWER

THE WAY THE WORLD CAME SWINGING ROUND MY EARS

I KNEW WHAT DOCTOR MEANT THE DAY HE SAID,

“TAKE CARE, UNLESS YOU WANT TO JOIN YOUR DEAD;

IT’S TIME TO END THIS BATTLING WITH YOUR YEARS.”

HE KNEW I’D HAVE THE BLACKEST WORD TOLD STRAIGHT,

WHETHER IT WAS MY CHILD THAT COULDN’T LIVE,

OR JOEL’S MIND, THICK-RIDDLED LIKE A SIEVE

WITH ALL THAT LOVING FESTERED INTO HATE.

BETTER TO KNOW THE WAYS YOU ARE ACCURST,

AND STAND UP FIERCE AND GLAD TO HEAR THE WORST.

THE BLOOD IS CHARGED, THE BACK IS STIFFENED SO.

WELL, ON THAT DAY THAT WAS A DAY AGO,

AND YET SO MANY HOURS AND YEARS AGO

NUMBERED IN SEIZURES OF A DARKENING BRAIN,

I STARTED UP THE ATTIC STAIRS AGAIN—

THE FIFTH TIME IN THE HOUR—NOT THINKING THEN

THAT IT WAS HOT, BUT KNOWING THE AIR SAT STILLER

UNDER THE EAVES THAN WHEN THE IDIOT KILLER

HID IN THE MATTHEWS BARN AMONG THE HAY

AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS THROUGH ONE AUGUST DAY

WAITED OUTSIDE WITH PITCHFORKS IN THE SUN.

JOEL WAITED TOO, AND WHEN THEY HEARD THE GUN

RESOUND SO FLATLY IN THE LOFT ABOVE

HE WAS THE ONE TO GIVE THE DOOR A SHOVE

AND CLIMB THE LADDER. A MAN NOT MADE FOR LOVE,

BUT BUILT FOR THINGS OF VIOLENCE; HE WOULD STAND

WHERE LIGHTNING FLASHED AND WATCH WITH EYES SO WIDE

YOU THOUGHT THE PRONGS OF FIRE WOULD STRIKE INSIDE;

OR SIT WITH SOME DECAYING BOOK IN HAND,

READING OF SPIRITS AND THE EVIL-EYED,

AND WITCHES’ SABBATHS IN A POISONED LAND.

SO IT WAS JOEL THAT BROUGHT THE FELLOW OUT,

TARNISHED WITH HAY AND BLOOD. I STILL CAN SEE

THE EYES THAT JOEL TURNED AND FIXED ON ME

WHEN IT WAS DONE—AS IF BY RIGHTS HIS WIFE

SHOULD GO TO HIM FOR HAVING RISKED HIS LIFE

AND SAY—I HARDLY KNEW WHAT THING HE WANTED.

I KNOW IT WAS A THING I NEVER GRANTED,

AND WHAT HIS MIND BECAME, FROM ALL THAT WOE,

THOSE VIOLENT CONCERNS HE LIVED AMONG,

WAS ON MY HEAD AS WELL. I COULDN’T GO,

I NEVER WENT TO HIM, I NEVER CLUNG

ONE MOMENT ON HIS BREAST. BUT I WAS YOUNG.

AND I WAS CRUEL, A GIRL-BRIDE SEEING ONLY

HER MARRIAGE AS A ROOM SO STRANGE AND LONELY

SHE LOOKED OUTSIDE FOR WARMTH. AND IN WHAT FASHION

COULD I BE VESSEL FOR THAT SOMBER PASSION—

FOR JOEL, DECREED TILL DEATH TO HAVE ME ALL?

THE TORTURED GRANDSIRE HANGING IN THE HALL

DEPICTED BY A LIMNER’S CRABBED HAND

SEEMED MORE A BEING THAT I COULD UNDERSTAND.

HOW COULD I HELP BUT LOOK BEYOND THAT WALL

AND PROBE THE LAWFUL STONES THAT BUILT IT STRONG

WITH QUESTIONS SHARPER THAN A PITCHFORK’S PRONG?

IF JOEL KNEW, HE KEPT HIS SILENCE LONG.

BUT EVANS AND I WERE HOPELESS FROM THE START:

HE, COLLARED EARLY BY A RIGOROUS CREED,

NOT MAN OF MEN BUT MAN OF GOD INDEED,

WHOSE EYE HAD SEEN DAMNATION, AND WHOSE HEART

THRUST ALL IT KNEW OF PASSION INTO ONE

CHAMBER OF IRON INSCRIBED THY WILL BE DONE.

YET SENSE WILL HAVE REVENGE ON ONE WHO TRIES

TO DOWN HIS SENSES WITH THE BRAND OF LIES.

THE ROAD WAS EMPTY FROM THE VILLAGE HOME,

EMPTY OF ALL BUT US AND THAT DARK THIRD,

THE SUDDEN NORTHERN SPRING. THERE MUST BE SOME

FOR WHOM THE THRUSTING BLOOD, SO LONG DEFERRED

IN ALDER-STEM AND ELM, IS NOT THE RISE

OF FLOOD IN THEIR OWN VEINS; SOME WHO CAN SEE

THAT GREEN UNHOLY DANCE WITHOUT SURPRISE.

I ONLY SAY IT HAS BEEN THIS FOR ME:

THE TIME OF THINNEST ICE, OF CASUALTY

MORE SWIFT AND DEADLY THAN THE SKATER’S DANGER.

THE END OF MARCH COULD MAKE ME STAND A STRANGER

ON MY OWN DOORSTEP, AND THE DAILY SHAPES

OF TEAPOT, LADLE, OR THE CHINA GRAPES

I KEPT IN WINTER ON THE DRESSER SHELF

REBUKED ME, MADE ME FOREIGN TO MYSELF.

EVANS BESIDE ME ON THAT MOONLESS ROAD

WALKED HARD AS IF HE THOUGHT BEHIND US STRODE

PURSUERS HE HAD FLED THROUGH WEARY WAYS.

HE ONLY SAID: “WHERE I WAS BORN AND GREW,

YOU FELT THE SPRING COME ON YOU LIKE A DAZE

SLOW OUT OF FEBRUARY, AND YOU KNEW

THE THING YOU WERE CONTENDING WITH. BUT HERE—”

“SPRING IS A BOLT OF LIGHTNING ON THE YEAR,”

I SAID, “IT STRIKES BEFORE YOU FEEL IT NEAR.”

“THE CHANGE OF SEASONS IS ANOTHER THING

GOD PUT ON EARTH TO TRY US, I BELIEVE.

AS IF THE BREAKING-OUT OF GREEN COULD BRING

ESCAPE FROM FROZEN DISCIPLINE, GIVE US LEAVE

TO TASTE OF THINGS BY WILL AND LAW FORBIDDEN.”

“MAYBE IT WAS THE WEATHER LOST US EDEN,”

I SAID, BUT FALTERING, AND THE WORDS WENT BY

LIKE FLIGHTS OF MOTHS UNDER THAT STAR-SOAKED SKY.

AND THAT WAS ALL. HE BROUGHT ME TO THE DOOR;

THE HOUSE WAS DARK, BUT ON THE UPPER FLOOR

A LIGHT BURNED IN THE HALLWAY. “JOEL’S ASLEEP,”

I TOLD HIM, AND PUT OUT MY HAND. HIS TOUCH

WAS COLD AS CANDLES KEPT UNLIT IN CHURCH,

AND YET I FELT HIS SEEKING FINGERS CREEP

ABOUT MY WRIST AND SEIZE IT IN THEIR GRIP

UNTIL THEY HURT ME.

“NEITHER YOU NOR I

HAVE LIVED IN EDEN, BUT THEY SAY WE DIE

TO GAIN THAT DAY AT LAST. WE HAVE TO LIVE

BELIEVING IT—WHAT ELSE CAN WE BELIEVE?”

“WHY NOT BELIEVE IN LIFE?” I SAID, BUT HEARD

ONLY THE SANCTIONED AUTOMATIC WORD

“ETERNAL LIFE—” PERENNIAL ANSWER GIVEN

TO THOSE WHO ASK ON EARTH A TASTE OF HEAVEN.

THE PENALTY YOU PAY FOR DYING LAST

IS FACING THOSE TRANSACTIONS FROM THE PAST

THAT WOULD DETAIN YOU WHEN YOU TRY TO GO.

ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT I LAY AND SEEMED TO HEAR

THE TO-AND-FRO OF CALLERS DOWN BELOW,

EVEN THE KNOCKER RATTLING ON THE DOOR.

I THOUGHT THE DEAD HAD HEARD MY TIME WAS NEAR

TO MEET THEM, AND HAD COME TO TELL ME SO;

BUT NOT A FOOTSTEP SOUNDED ON THE STAIR.

IF THEY ARE GONE IT MEANS A FEW DAYS MORE

ARE LEFT, OR THEY WOULD WAIT. JOEL WOULD WAIT

DOWN BY THE DARK OLD CLOCK THAT TOLD ME LATE

THAT NIGHT FROM BOSTON. “EVANS WALKED ME HOME;

WE SAT TOGETHER IN THE TRAIN BY CHANCE.”

BUT NOT A WORD; ONLY HIS BURNING GLANCE.

“WE STOPPED TO HAVE SOME COFFEE IN THE STATION.

WHY DO YOU STAND LIKE THAT? WHAT IF I COME

AN HOUR OR SO AFTER THE TIME I SAID?

THE HOUSE ALL DARK, I THOUGHT YOU’D GONE TO BED.”

BUT STILL THAT GAZE, NOT ANGER, INDIGNATION,

NOR ANYTHING SO EASY, BUT A LOOK

AS FIXED AS WHEN HE STARED UPON HIS BOOK.

NO MATTER IF MY TALE WAS FALSE OR TRUE,

I WAS A WOODCUT FIGURE ON THE PAGE,

ON TRIAL FOR A NAMELESS SIN. THEN RAGE

TOOK HIM LIKE FIRE WHERE LIGHTNING DIVES. I KNEW

THAT HE COULD KILL ME THEN, BUT WHAT HE DID

WAS WRENCH ME UP THE STAIRS, ONTO THE BED.

THE NIGHT OF JOEL’S DEATH I SLEPT ALONE

IN THIS SAME ROOM. A NEIGHBOR SAID SHE’D STAY,

THINKING THE DEAD MAN LYING DOWN BELOW

MIGHT KEEP THE LIVING FROM REST. SHE TOLD ME SO:

“THOSE HOURS BEFORE THE DAWN CAN LIE LIKE STONE

UPON THE HEART—I’VE LAIN AWAKE—I KNOW.”

AT LAST I HAD TO TAKE THE ONLY WAY,

AND SAID, “THE NIGHTS HE WAS ALIVE AND WALKING

FROM ROOM TO ROOM AND HEARING SPIRITS TALKING,

WHAT SLEEP I HAD WAS LIKELIER TO BE BROKEN.”

HER FACE WAS SHOCKED BUT I WAS GLAD I’D SPOKEN.

“WELL, IF YOU FEEL SO—:” SHE WOULD TELL THE TALE

NEXT MORNING, BUT AT LAST I WAS ALONE

IN AN EXISTENCE FINALLY MY OWN.

AND YET I KNEW THAT EVANS WOULD FIND REASON

WHY WE WERE NOT OUR OWN, NOR HAD OUR WILL

UNHINDERED; THAT DISTURBANCE OF A SEASON

SO LONG REMOVED WAS SOMETHING HE WOULD KILL

YET, IF HE HAD NOT KILLED IT. WHEN I STOOD

BESIDE THE CHURCHYARD FENCE AND FELT HIS GLANCE

RELUCTANTLY COMPELLING MINE, THE BLOOD

SOARED TO MY FACE, THE TOMBSTONES SEEMED TO DANCE

DIZZILY, TILL I TURNED. THE EYES I MET

ACCUSED AS THEY IMPLORED ME TO FORGET,

AS IF MY SHAPE HAD RISEN TO DESTROY

SALVATION’S RAMPART WITH A HOPE OF JOY.

MY LIPS BETRAYED THEIR WHY? BUT THEN HIS FACE

TURNED FROM ME, AND I SAW HIM LEAVE THE PLACE.

NOW JOEL AND EVANS ARE NEIGHBORS, DOWN BENEATH.

I WONDER WHAT WE’RE BOUND TO AFTER DEATH?

I WONDER WHAT’S EXACTED OF THE DEAD,

HOW MANY DEBTS OF CONSCIENCE STILL ARE GOOD?

NOT EVANS OR HIS BIBLE EVER SAID

THAT SPIRIT MUST COMPLETE WHAT FLESH AND BLOOD

CONTRACTED IN THEIR TERM. WHAT CREDITORS

WILL WAIT AND KNOCK FOR US AT MARBLE DOORS?

I’D LIKE TO KNOW WHICH STAYS WHEN LIFE IS PAST:

THE MARRIAGE KEPT IN FEAR, THE LOVE DEFERRED,

THE FOOTSTEP WAITED FOR AND NEVER HEARD,

THE PRESSURE OF FIVE FINGERS ROUND THE WRIST

STOPPING ITS BEAT WITH PAIN, THE MOUTH UNKISSED,

THE DREAM WHOSE WAKING STARTLES INTO SIGHT

A FIGURE MUMBLING BY THE BED AT NIGHT,

THE HOPELESS PROMISE OF ETERNAL LIFE—

TAKE NOW YOUR SCRIPTURE, EVANS, IF YOU WILL,

AND SEE HOW FLIMSILY THE PAGES SPILL

FROM SPINES REDUCED TO DUST. WHAT HAVE THEY SAID

OF US, TO WHAT WILL THEY PRONOUNCE ME WIFE?

MY DEBT IS PAID: THE REST IS ON YOUR HEAD.

THE INSOMNIACS

THE MYSTIC FINISHES IN TIME,

THE ACTOR FINDS HIMSELF IN SPACE;

AND EACH, WHEREVER HE HAS BEEN,

MUST KNOW HIS HAND BEFORE HIS FACE,

MUST CRAWL BACK INTO HIS OWN SKIN

AS IN THE DARKNESS AFTER CRIME

THE THIEF CAN HEAR HIS BREATH AGAIN,

RESUME THE KNOWLEDGE OF HIS LIMBS

AND HOW THE SPASM GOES AND COMES

UNDER THE BONES THAT CAGE HIS HEART.

SO: WE ARE FAIRLY MET, GRAVE FRIEND—

THE MEETING OF TWO WOUNDS IN MAN.

I, GESTURING WITH PRACTICED HAND,

I, IN MY GREAT BROCADED GOWN,

AND YOU, THE FIXED AND PATIENT ONE,

ENDURING ALL THE WORLD CAN DO.

I, WITH MY SHIFTING MASKS, THE GOLD,

THE AWFUL SCARLET, LAUGHING BLUE,

MAKER OF MANY WORLDS; AND YOU,

WORLDLESS, THE PURE RECEPTACLE.

AND YET YOUR FLOATING EYES REVEAL

WHAT SAINT OR MUMMER GROANS TO FEEL:

THAT FINITE CREATURES FINALLY KNOW

THE DAMP OF STONE BENEATH THE KNEES,

THE STIFFNESS IN THE FOLDED HANDS

A DULLER ACHE THAN HOLY WOUNDS,

THE DRAUGHT THAT NEVER STIRS THE SLEEVE

OF GLAZED EVANGELISTS ABOVE,

BUT DRIVES MEN OUT FROM SACRED CALM

INTO THE VIOLENT, WAYWARD SUN.

MY VOICE COMMANDS THE FORMAL STAGE;

A JUNGLE THRIVES BEYOND THE WINGS—

ALL FORMLESS AND BENIGHTED THINGS

THAT RHETORIC CANNOT ASSUAGE.

I SPEAK A DREAM AND TURN TO SEE

THE SLEEPNESS NIGHT OUTSTARING ME.

MY PILLOW SWEATS; I WAKE IN SPACE.

THIS IS MY HAND BEFORE MY FACE.

THIS IS THE HEADBOARD OF MY BED

WHOSE SPLINTERS STUFF MY NIGHTMARE MOUTH;

THIS IS THE UNCONQUERABLE DROUTH

I CARRY IN MY BURNING HEAD.

NOT MY WORDS NOR YOUR VISIONS MEND

SUCH INFAMOUS KNOWLEDGE. WE ARE SPLIT,

DONE INTO BITS, UNDONE, PALE FRIEND,

AS ECSTASY BEGETS ITS END;

AS WE ARE SPUN OF RAWEST THREAD—

THE FLAW IS IN US; WE WILL BREAK.

O DARE YOU OF THIS FRACTURE MAKE

HOSANNAS PLAIN AND TRAGICAL,

OR DARE I LET EACH CADENCE FALL

AWKWARD AS LEARNING NEWLY LEARNED,

SIMPLE AS CHILDREN’S CRADLE SONGS,

AS UNTRANSLATABLE AND TRUE,

WE SOMEDAY MIGHT CONCEIVE A WAY

TO DO THE THING WE LONG TO DO—

TO DO WHAT MEN HAVE ALWAYS DONE—

TO LIVE IN TIME, TO ACT IN SPACE

YET FIND A RITUAL TO EMBRACE

RAW TOWNS OF MAN, THE POCKMARKED SUN.

THE SNOW QUEEN

CHILD WITH A CHIP OF MIRROR IN HIS EYE

SAW THE WORLD UGLY, FLED TO PLAINS OF ICE

WHERE BEAUTY WAS THE SNOW QUEEN’S PROMISES.

UNDER MY LIDS A SPLINTER SHARP AS HIS

HAS MADE ME WISH YOU LYING DEAD

WHOSE IMAGE DIGS THE NEEDLE DEEPER STILL.

IN THE DECEPTIVE PROVINCE OF MY BIRTH

I HAD SEEN YES TURN NO, THE SAINTS DESCEND,

THEIR SACRED FACES TWISTED INTO SMILES,

THE STARS GONE LECHERING, THE VILLAGE SPRING

GUSH MUD AND TOADS—ALL MIRACLES

BEFITTING AN INCALCULABLE AGE.

TO LOVE A HUMAN FACE WAS TO DISCOVER

THE CRACKS OF PAINT AND VARNISH ON THE BROW;

SOON TO DISTRUST ALL IMPULSES OF FLESH

THAT STREWS ITS SAWDUST ON THE CHAMBER FLOOR,

WHILE AT THE WINDOW PEER TWO CRONES

WHO ONCE WERE JULIET AND JESSICA.

NO MATTER, SINCE I KEPT A LITTLE WHILE

ONE THING INTACT FROM THAT PERVERSITY—

THOUGH LANDSCAPES BLOOMED IN MONSTROUS CUBES AND COILS.

IN YOU BELONGED SIMPLICITIES OF LIGHT

TO MEND DISTRACTION, TEACH THE AIR

TO SHINE, THE STARS TO FIND THEIR WAY AGAIN.

YET HERE THE SNOW QUEEN’S COLD PRODIGIOUS WILL

COMMANDS ME, AND YOUR FACE HAS LOST ITS POWER,

DISSOLVING TO ITS OPPOSITE LIKE THE REST.

UNDER MY RIBS A DIAMOND SPLINTER NOW

STICKS, AND HAS TAKEN ROOT; I KNOW

ONLY THIS FROZEN SPEAR THAT DRIVES ME THROUGH.

LOVE IN THE MUSEUM

NOW WILL YOU STAND FOR ME, IN THIS COOL LIGHT,

INFANTA REARED IN ANCIENT ETIQUETTE,

A POINT-LACE QUEEN OF MANNERS. AT YOUR FEET

THE DOLL-LIKE ROYAL DOG DEMURELY SET

UPON A CHEQUERED FLOOR OF BLACK AND WHITE.

OR BE A LOUIS’ MISTRESS, BY BOUCHER,

LOUNGING ON CUSHIONS, SILKEN FEET ASPRAWL

UPON A COUCH WHERE CASUAL CUPIDS PLAY

WHILE ON YOUR ARMS AND SHOULDERS SEEMS TO FALL

THE TIRED EXTRAVAGANCE OF A SUNSET DAY.

OR LET ME THINK I PAUSE BESIDE A DOOR

AND SEE YOU IN A BODICE BY VERMEER,

WHERE LIGHT FALLS QUARTERED ON THE POLISHED FLOOR

AND RIMS THE LINE OF WATER TILTING CLEAR

OUT OF AN EARTHEN PITCHER AS YOU POUR.

BUT ART REQUIRES A DISTANCE: LET ME BE

ALWAYS THE CONNOISSEUR OF YOUR PERFECTION.

STAY WHERE THE SPACES OF THE GALLERY

FLOW CALM BETWEEN YOUR POSE AND MY INSPECTION,

LEST ONE IMPERFECT GESTURE MAKE DEMANDS

AS TROUBLING AS THE TOUCH OF HUMAN HANDS.

I HEARD A HERMIT SPEAK

UPON THE MOUNTAIN OF THE YOUNG

I HEARD A HERMIT SPEAK:

“PURITY IS THE SERPENT’S EYE

THAT MURDERS WITH A LOOK.

PURITY’S KING OF POISONS

AND DUKE OF DEADLY NIGHT.

ABHOR THE SINGLE-MINDED MAN,

THE WOMAN LILY-WHITE.

GO COLD UNDER THE HEAVENS,

RUN NAKED THROUGH THE DAY,

BUT NEVER WEAR THE ARMORED SHIRT

OF TOTAL YEA OR NAY.

STARE INTO THE LOOKING-GLASS:

YOUR ENEMY STARES YOU BACK.

YET NEVER CRINGE AND HIDE YOUR FACE;

HEAR ALL THAT HE WILL SPEAK.

THE DAY THAT GLASS DISSOLVES TO SHOW

YOUR OWN REFLECTION THERE,

THEN CHANGE YOUR MIRROR FOR THE WORLD,

THE TEEMING, STREAMING AIR.

O LET YOUR HUMAN MEMORY END

HEAVY WITH THOUGHT AND ACT.

CLAIM EVERY JOY OF PARADOX

THAT TIME WOULD KEEP INTACT.

BE RICH AS YOU ARE HUMAN,”

I HEARD THAT HERMIT CRY

TO THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN

ALL WALKING OUT TO DIE.

COLOPHON

IN THIS LONG ROOM, UPON EACH WESTERN PANE

THE SUNSET WREAKS ITS FINAL SAVAGE STAIN;

AND WE, LIKE MASQUERS COSTUMED IN AN AIR

OUTCRIMSONING THE GAUDIEST COCK THAT CROWS,

PARADE AS TORCHES AND DIABOLOS

ALONG THE BLOOD-RED SPIRAL OF THE STAIR.

AN IMMINENT AMAZEMENT OF THE HEART

CONSTRICTS OUR GREETING AS WE MEET AND PART.

A GESTURE OR A WORD CAN MAKE US TURN

READY TO CRY A SUDDEN SHARP GOODNIGHT;

YET STILL DELAYS THE DARK, STILL COCKEREL-BRIGHT

SMOULDER THE DYES IN WHICH WE WADE AND BURN.

NOT TRAGICAL, THE FACES THAT WE WEAR:

A MODERN GAIETY, FITTING AS DESPAIR

SHALL PASS THE HOUR TILL DOMES AND SUNSETS FALL.

EXTRAVAGANT AND CEREMONIOUS WORDS

RISE ON THE AIR LIKE FLIGHTS OF CHINESE BIRDS

UNCAGED UPON A FIERY CARNIVAL.

WHAT’S LEFT US IN THIS VIOLENT SPECTACLE

BUT KISSES ON THE MOUTH, OR WORKS OF WILL—

THE IMAGINATION’S FORM SO STERNLY WROUGHT,

THE FLASHES OF THE BRAIN SO BOLDLY PENNED

THAT WHEN THE SUNSET GUTTERS TO ITS END

THE WORLD’S LAST THOUGHT WILL BE OUR FLARING THOUGHT?

A WALK BY THE CHARLES

FINALITY BROODS UPON THE THINGS THAT PASS:

PERSUADED BY THIS AIR, THE TRUMP OF DOOM

MIGHT HANG UNSOUNDED WHILE THE AUTUMN GLOOM

DARKENS THE LEAF AND SMOKES THE RIVER’S GLASS.

FOR NOTHING SO SUSCEPTIBLE TO DEATH

BUT ON THIS FORENOON SEEMS TO HOLD ITS BREATH:

THE SILENT SINGLE OARSMEN ON THE STREAM

ARE ALWAYS YOUNG, ARE ROWERS IN A DREAM.

THE LOVERS UNDERNEATH THE CHESTNUT TREE,

THOUGH LOVE IS OVER, STAND BEMUSED TO SEE

THE SEASON FALLING WHERE NO FALL COULD BE.

YOU OARSMEN, WHEN YOU ROW BEYOND THE BEND,

WILL SEE THE RIVER WINDING TO ITS END.

LOVERS THAT HOLD THE CHESTNUT BURR IN HAND

WILL SPEAK AT LAST OF DEATH, WILL UNDERSTAND,

FOOT-DEEP AMID THE RUINAGE OF THE YEAR,

WHAT SMELL IT IS THAT STINGS THE GATHERING AIR.

FROM OUR EVASION WE ARE BROUGHT AT LAST,

FROM ALL OUR HOPES OF CONSTANCY, TO CAST

ONE LOOK OF RECOGNITION AT THE SKY,

THE UNIMPORTANT LEAVES THAT FLUTTER BY.

WHY ELSE UPON THIS BANK ARE WE SO STILL?

WHAT LENDS US ANCHOR BUT THE MUTABLE?

O LOVERS, LET THE BRIDGE OF YOUR TWO HANDS

BE BROKEN, LIKE THE MIRRORED BRIDGE THAT BENDS

AND SHIVERS ON THE SURFACE OF THE STREAM.

YOUNG OARSMEN, WHO IN TIMELESS GESTURE SEEM

CONTINUOUS, UNITED WITH THE TIDE,

LEAVE OFF YOUR BENDING TO THE OAR, AND GLIDE

PAST INNOCENCE, BEYOND THESE AGING BRICKS

TO WHERE THE CHARLES FLOWS IN TO JOIN THE STYX.

NEW YEAR MORNING

THE BELLS HAVE QUIT THEIR CLANGING; HERE BENEATH

THE COLDLY FURIOUS STREAKS OF MORNING STARS

WE HEAR THE SCRAPING OF THE LAST FEW CARS,

AND ON THE DOORSTEP BY THE FROZEN WREATH

RETURN GOODNIGHTS TO NIGHT. DEAR FRIENDS, ONCE MORE

WE’VE HELD OUR STRENGTH AGAINST A STRAINING DOOR,

AGAIN THE SIEGE IS PAST, ANOTHER YEAR

HAS LOST THE BATTLE. YOU CAN LEAVE US NOW.

THE HOURS ARE DONE THAT MUST BE CLAMORED THROUGH

LEST DARKNESS THINK US SLEEPING, LEST WE HEAR

SECRET POLICE ENGENDERED OUT OF NIGHT

ADVANCING ON OUR LITTLE ZONE OF LIGHT.

NOW EACH OF US CAN DARE TO BE ALONE,

HIS ROOM NO LONGER POPULOUS WITH SPIES

BENDING ABOVE THE PILLOW WHERE HE LIES

TO SOW HIS DREAMS WITH FEAR THAT ALL IS DONE,

THAT THERE’S NO MORE REPRIEVE, NO LEAF TO TEAR

AND FIND ANOTHER JANUARY THERE.

SO WE ARE SAFE AGAIN. GOODNIGHT, BRAVE FRIENDS.

SO MAY BEGINNINGS ALWAYS FOLLOW ENDS.

THOUGH TIME IS TREASONABLE, MAY WE STAND

GATHERED EACH YEAR, A STUBBORN-HEARTED BAND

WHOSE GAIETY RISES LIKE A LITANY

UNDER THE DYING ORNAMENTAL TREE.

IN TIME OF CARNIVAL

THOSE LIGHTS, THAT PLAZA—I SHOULD KNOW THEM ALL:

THE IMPOTENT BLIND BEGGAR SHOUTING HIS SONGS

OF LOVERS, WHILE THE HEADLONG POPULACE

DRINKS, TRAMPLES, IMMOLATES ITSELF IN ACTION;

THE BLOODY LIGHT OF BRAZIERS ON THE FACES

OF WOMEN WHO ARE ACTION’S MEANS AND END,

EACH A LAUGHING FURY; THE TOWERING GLASS

OF THOSE CATHEDRAL SAINTS, WHOSE STIFFENED FORMS,

RUBY IN PASSING TORCHLIGHT, STOOP TO DARK

AND FLARE AGAIN AS PUPPETS OF DISORDER,

LIFELESS WITHOUT ITS LIGHT, BUT IN THAT ROUT

ILLUMINED AND EMPOWERED. THERE’S NO CROWD

IN NAVE OR PLAYHOUSE ANY MORE; FOR ALL

ARE ACTORS WHERE MERE PASTEBOARD ROARS TO HEAVEN

UNDER THE DROPPED MATCH, AND THE STREETS ALONE,

THE AMPHITHEATRE OF GREAT NIGHT ITSELF,

SUFFICE TO CONTAIN THEIR SCENE. NOTHING WILL DO

BUT ACTION OF THE SENSES, TOTAL SEIZURE

OF WHAT’S TO HAND. AND THROUGH THE SWAYING STREETS

THAT BEGGAR, IMPOTENT SINCE YOUTH, SINGS ON,

IGNORANT OF THE SCENE, BLIND TO HIS POWER,

THE SONGS THAT SEND THOSE LOVERS WILD TO BED.

THE MIDDLE-AGED

THEIR FACES, SAFE AS AN INTERIOR

OF HOLLAND TILES AND ORIENTAL CARPET,

WHERE THE FRUIT-BOWL, ALWAYS FILLED, STOOD IN A LIGHT

OF PLACID AFTERNOON—THEIR VOICES’ MEASURE,

THEIR FIGURES MOVING IN THE SUNDAY GARDEN

TO LAY THE TEA OUTDOORS OR TRIM THE BORDERS,

AFFLICTED, HAUNTED US. FOR TO BE YOUNG

WAS ALWAYS TO LIVE IN OTHER PEOPLE’S HOUSES

WHOSE PEACE, IF WE SOUGHT IT, HAD BEEN MADE BY OTHERS,

WAS OURS AT SECOND-HAND AND NOT FOR LONG.

THE CUSTOM OF THE HOUSE, NOT OURS, THE SUN

FADING THE SILVER-BLUE FORTUNY CURTAINS,

THE REMINISCENCE OF A CHRISTMAS PARTY

OF FOURTEEN YEARS AGO—ALL MEMORY,

SIGNS OF POSSESSION AND OF BEING POSSESSED,

WE TASTED, TENSE WITH ENVY. THEY WERE SO KIND,

WOULD HAVE GIVEN US ANYTHING; THE BOWL OF FRUIT

WAS FILLED FOR US, THERE WAS A ROOM UPSTAIRS

WE MUST CALL OURS: BUT TWENTY YEARS OF LIVING

THEY COULD NOT GIVE. NOR DID THEY EVER SPEAK

OF THE COARSE STAIN ON THAT POLISHED BALUSTRADE,

THE CRACK IN THE STUDY WINDOW, OR THE LETTERS

LOCKED IN A DRAWER AND THE KEY DESTROYED.

ALL TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY US, RETURNING

LATE, IN OUR OWN TIME—HOW THAT PEACE WAS MADE,

UPON WHAT TERMS, WITH HOW MUCH LEFT UNSAID.

THE MARRIAGE PORTION

FROM COMMISSARS OF DAYLIGHT

LOVE CANNOT MAKE US FREE.

NIGHTS OF UNGRACIOUS DARKNESS

HANG OVER YOU AND ME.

WE LIE AWAKE TOGETHER

AND HEAR THE CLOCKS STRIKE THREE.

OUR LOVING CANNOT EXILE

THE FELONS BUT AND IF;

YET BEING UNDIVIDED

SOME WAYS WE CAN CONTRIVE

TO HOLD OFF THOSE BESIEGERS

WHO BATTER ROUND OUR LIFE:

THE THIEVES OF OUR COMPLETENESS

WHO STEAL US STONE BY STONE,

THE PATRONAGE THAT SCOWLS UPON

OUR NEED TO BE ALONE,

AND ALL THE CLEVER PEOPLE

WHO WANT US FOR THEIR OWN.

THE TELEPHONE IS RINGING,

AND PLANES AND TRAINS DEPART.

THE COCKTAIL PARTY’S FORMING,

THE CRUISE ABOUT TO START.

TO STAY BEHIND IS FATAL—

ACT NOW, THE TIME IS SHORT.

IF WE REFUSE THE SUMMONS

AND STAND AT LAST ALONE,

WE WALK INTACT AND CERTAIN,

AS MAN AND WOMAN GROWN

IN THE DESERTED PLAYGROUND

WHEN ALL THE REST HAVE GONE.

THE TREE

LONG AGO I FOUND A SEED,

AND KEPT IT IN A GLASS OF WATER,

AND HALF FORGOT MY DIM INTENT

UNTIL I SAW IT START TO REACH

FOR LIFE WITH ONE BLIND, FRAGILE ROOT.

AND THEN I PRESSED IT INTO EARTH

AND SAW ITS TENDRILS SEEK THE AIR,

SO SLOWLY THAT I HARDLY KNEW

OF ANY CHANGE TILL IT HAD GROWN

A STALK, A LEAF; AND SEEMED TO BE

NO MORE A THING IN NEED OF ME,

BUT LIVING BY SOME SAPIENCE

I HAD NOT GIVEN, COULD NOT WITHDRAW.

SO IT GREW ON, AND DAYS WENT BY,

AND SEASONS WITH THEIR COMMON GIFTS,

TILL AT THE LEAFAGE OF THE YEAR

I FELT THE SUN CUT OFF FROM ME

BY SOMETHING THICK OUTSIDE MY ROOM—

NOT YET A TREE GROWN TO THE FULL,

YET SO ENDOWED WITH NEED AND WILL

IT TOOK THE WARMTH AND LEFT ME COLD.

AND FIRST I CLIMBED WITH HOOK AND SHEARS

TO PRUNE THE BOUGHS THAT DARKENED ME,

BUT THE TREE WAS STUBBORNER THAN I,

AND WHERE I CLIPPED IT GREW AGAIN,

BRUTAL IN PURPOSE AS A WEED.

NOR DID IT GIVE OF FRUIT OR FLOWER,

THOUGH SEASONS BROUGHT THEIR COMMON GIFTS,

AND YEARS WENT BY. IT ONLY GREW

DARKER AND DENSER TO MY VIEW,

TAKING WHATEVER I WOULD YIELD—

THE HOMAGE OF A TROUBLED MIND—

REQUIRING NOTHING, YET ACCEPTING

MY WILLINGNESS TO GUARD ITS LIFE

BY THE ENDURANCE OF MY OWN.

IT GIVES ME NOTHING; YET I SEE

SOMETIMES IN DREAMS MY ENEMY

HANGED BY THE HAIR UPON THAT TREE.

LOVERS ARE LIKE CHILDREN

CHAGALL’S SWEET LOVERS MOUNTING INTO BLUE

REMIND ME THAT DISCOVERY BY TWO

OF ANY WORLD THE MIND CAN WANDER THROUGH

IS LIKE THE TIME WHEN YOUNG AND LEFT ALONE,

WE TOUCHED THE SECRET FRINGE OF BEING ONE,

BACK OF THE PLAYGROUND FULL OF EVERYONE.

LOVE IS LIKE CHILDHOOD, CAUGHT IN TRUST AND FEAR.

THE STATUES POINT TO OMENS IN THE AIR,

AND YET THE FOUNTAINS BUBBLE BRIGHT AND CLEAR.

LOST IN THE GARDEN RANK WITH CONTRADICTION,

WE SEE THE FENCES SPROUT FOR OUR AFFLICTION,

AND THE RED-ROSE-TREE CURTLY LABELLED FICTION.

NOTHING TO TELL US WHETHER WHAT THEY MEAN

IS TRUE OF THIS OR ANY OTHER SCENE.

WE ONLY KNOW THE SUMMER LEAVES ARE GREEN,

ALIVE AND DENSE FOR TWO TO PENETRATE—

AN EXPLORATION DIFFICULT AND GREAT

AS WHEN ONE DAY BESIDE THE SCHOOLYARD GATE,

STRAGGLING BEHIND TO GLEAN A SUNLIT STONE,

ONE FIRST PERCEIVED AND KNEW ITSELF AS ONE.

NOW ADD THIS PEBBLE TO THAT EARLY ONE.

WHEN THIS CLANGOR IN THE BRAIN

SAY A MASTER OF THE TRACK

LIGHTLY LEAPED AND LIGHTLY RAN,

KNEW HIS POWERS OF CHEST AND THIGH

CLEAN OUTSTRIPPED THE THOUGHT OF MAN—

WOULD IT NOT BE PILL AND PATCH

AND WORSE THAN QUEASY CRIPPLES KNOW,

IF ON A DAY THE RHEUM SHOULD CATCH

AND LAY THAT MASTER LEAPER LOW?

SAY THAT INTO CERTAIN MINDS

A MERLIN DANCES, IN AND OUT,

AND WHAT HE CHOOSES, MUST OBEY

AND SWAY THE THOUGHT IT THINKS ABOUT—

WOULD IT NOT BE OLD FOLKS’ HOME

AND THE DRY END OF THE YEAR

FOR THE MIND HE LEFT AGAIN

UNMASTERED, LOCK AND STOCK AND GEAR?

WHEN THIS CLANGOR IN THE BRAIN

GROWS PERFUNCTORY, OR WORSE,

PUT ME DOWN A SICK OLD WOMAN

PROPPED FOR SLEEP, HIRE ME A NURSE;

TILL THEN, ALL THINGS I LOOK UPON

BEAT ON MY BRAIN TO HAIL AND BLESS,

AND EVERY LAST AND WAYWARD POWER

I CLAIM TILL THEN, AND NOTHING LESS.

A VIEW OF MERTON COLLEGE

AN INTERVAL: THE VIEW ACROSS THE FIELDS

PERFECT AND INSUSCEPTIBLE AS SEEN

IN PRINTSHOPS OF THE HIGH STREET—SUN ON STONE

WORN LIKE OLD NEEDLEWORK, THE SHEEN OF GRASS,

MINUTE AND AGELESS FIGURES MOVING DOWN

THE BROAD WALK UNDER TINTED TREES. AWHILE

MIND’S LOCAL JANGLING LIGHTENS, EAR IS EASED,

EYE’S FLAW IS MENDED IN SUCH GAZING, HEALED

BY SEPARATION AS THROUGH GLASS. UNTIL

SUN SHIFTS, AIR TURNS HARSHER, PALER, ROOKS

FLAP IN THE RISING WIND. THE WIND HAS FOUND YOU,

THE MORTAL LIGHT OF DAY, WHOSE ENVY, WASTE,

IRRESOLUTION TREAD YOU AS YOU GO

GUILTY AND HUMAN. HERE AS ANYWHERE,

PEACE OF THE MIND LIES THROUGH AN ARCH OF STONE,

THE LIMITATIONS POSTED STRICT AND CLEAR:

NOT TO BE LITTERED OR PRESUMED UPON.

HOLIDAY

SUMMER WAS ANOTHER COUNTRY, WHERE THE BIRDS

WOKE US AT DAWN AMONG THE DRIPPING LEAVES

AND LENT TO ALL OUR FÊTES THEIR SWEET APPROVAL.

THE TOUCH OF AIR ON FLESH WAS LIGHTER, KEENER,

THE SENSES FLOURISHED LIKE A LADEN TREE

WHOSE EVERY GESTURE FINISHES IN A FLOWER.

IN THOSE UNWARDENED PROVINCES WE DINED

FROM WICKER BASKETS BY A GREEN CANAL,

STAINING OUR LIPS WITH PEACH AND NECTARINE,

SLAPPING AT GOLDEN WASPS. AND WHEN WE KISSED,

TASTING THAT SUNLIT JUICE, THE LANDSCAPE FOLDED

INTO OUR CLASP, AND NOT A BREATH RECALLED

THE LONG WALK BACK TO WINTER, LEAGUES AWAY.

THE CAPITAL

UNDER THAT SUMMER ASPHALT, UNDER VISTAS

ASPIRING TO A NEO-CLASSIC CALM,

THE STEAMING BURGEON OF POTOMAC’S SWAMP

HAS NEVER QUITE BEEN LAID TO REST. THE EYE

WINCES IN SUNLIGHT OFF A MARBLE DOME.

BUT CANNOT FIX THE FACE OF JEFFERSON

THROUGH HAZE OF AN OUTRAGEOUS ATMOSPHERE

BY DIPLOMATS CALLED TROPIC; NOR CAN THE EAR

HOLD TO THE LIFELINE OF A SINGLE VOICE

THROUGH JETTISONED RUMORS JAMMING ALL THE AIR.

THE DOLLAR IN THAT CITY OF INSCRIPTIONS

IS MINTED AMONG PEDIMENTS AND COLUMNS

PURER THAN NEWMADE COIN. THE AFTERNOON

STEAMS WITH THE DRIP OF DEPARTMENTAL FOUNTAINS

AND HUMID BRANCHES BREATHING OVERHEAD

DOWN AVENUES WHERE THE SIREN’S NERVOUS SHRIEK

PURSUES THE MURDERER OR THE FOREIGN GUEST

THROUGH THOSE INDIFFERENT NOONDAY CROWDS WHO NEVER

ASK, TILL HISTORY TELLS THEM, WHAT THEY DO

IN THAT METROPOLIS ANYTHING BUT GREEK.

THE PLATFORM

THE RAILWAY STATIONS OF OUR DAILY PLIGHT

SEE EVERY HOUR LOVE’S THREATENED OVERTHROW.

EACH AFTERNOON AT FIVE THE BUSES GO

LADEN WITH THOSE WHO SHALL BE FALSE BY NIGHT.

WE SAY GOODBYE IN ROOMS TOO BRIGHT WITH NOISE

TO CATCH THE SHADES OF A RECEDING VOICE;

WE TURN AT THE REVOLVING DOOR AND SEE

LOVE’S FACE ALREADY CHANGED, INDELIBLY.

NOT TO ADMIT WE MAY NOT MEET AGAIN—

THIS WAS THE PARTING TREASON OF OUR THOUGHT.

BATTERING DOWN OUR COWARDLY “TILL THEN,”

TIME’S TRAFFIC HEMS THE SEEKER FROM THE SOUGHT.

WE TAKE TOO SUDDEN LEAVE; THE PLATFORM REELS

WITH THUNDER OF A THOUSAND POUNDING HEELS,

AND AT THE GATE WHERE ONE REMAINS BEHIND,

THOUGH MOST WE STRAIN TO SEE, WE MOST ARE BLIND.

DEAR LOVES, DEAR FRIENDS, I TAKE MY LEAVE ALL DAY

IN PRACTICE FOR A TIME THAT NEED NOT COME.

I TURN AND MOVE FROM YOU A LITTLE WAY,

AS MEN WALK OUT BEYOND THE FIELDS OF HOME

IN TROUBLED DAYS, TO VIEW WHAT THEY LOVE WELL—

DISTANCE CONFIRMING FOR A MOMENT’S SPELL,

MEETING OR GOING, THAT WHEN WE EMBRACE

WE KNOW THE HEART BEYOND THE TRANSIENT FACE.

LAST SONG

ALL IN THE DAY THAT I WAS BORN,

I WALKED ACROSS THE SHOUTING CORN;

I SAW THE SUNLIGHT FLASH AND HAIL

FROM EVERY SPIRE AND EVERY SAIL,

BUT MOST I LEANED AGAINST THE SKY

TO HEAR THE EAGLES RACING BY,

AND ALL THE SAFETY OF THE WOMB

COULD NOT BETRAY ME, LURE ME HOME.

ALL IN THE DAY THAT I WAS WED

I SAW THEM STREW MY BRIDAL BED.

I SMELLED THE WIND ACROSS THE SHEETS

BREATHING OF LAVENDER AND SWEETS

THAT NEITHER SEA NOR MEADOW KNEW;

AND WHEN MY BRIDE WAS BROUGHT TO VIEW

I KEPT A HUNDRED CANDLES LIT

ALL FOR LIGHT AND THE JOY OF IT.

ALL IN THE DAY THAT I WAS OLD

I FELT THE WIND BLOW SALT AND COLD

LIKE SEASPRAY ON MY SHAKING THIGHS

OR SAND FLUNG UP TO BLIND MY EYES.

I CRIED FOR SUN AND THE EAGLES FLYING,

BUT FELT THOSE FINGERS SPYING, PRYING,

THE SAME THAT WRENCHED ME INTO LIFE

AND CUT MY SAFETY WITH A KNIFE.

SOON THEY WILL BIND ME DARK AND WARM

AND IMPOTENT TO SUFFER HARM.

I SHALL BE EXILED TO THE WOMB

WHERE ONCE I LAY AND THOUGHT IT HOME.

THE SUN THAT FLASHED MY FIRST DELIGHT

SHALL NEVER LEARN TO CLEAVE THAT NIGHT;

AND ALL THE SWORDS OF DANGER FLY

FAR FROM THE CAUL IN WHICH I LIE.

THE DIAMOND CUTTERS

HOWEVER LEGENDARY,

THE STONE IS STILL A STONE,

THOUGH IT HAD ONCE RESISTED

THE WEIGHT OF AFRICA,

THE HAMMER-BLOWS OF TIME

THAT WEAR TO BITS OF RUBBLE

THE MOUNTAIN AND THE PEBBLE—

BUT NOT THIS COLDEST ONE.

NOW, YOU INTELLIGENCE

SO LATE DREDGED UP FROM DARK

UPON WHOSE SMOKY WALLS

BISON TOOK FUMBLING FORM

OR FLINT WAS EDGED ON FLINT—

NOW, CAREFUL ARRIVISTE,

DELINEATE AT WILL

INCISIONS IN THE ICE.

BE SERIOUS, BECAUSE

THE STONE MAY HAVE CONTEMPT

FOR TOO-FAMILIAR HANDS,

AND BECAUSE ALL YOU DO

LOSES OR GAINS BY THIS:

RESPECT THE ADVERSARY,

MEET IT WITH TOOLS REFINED,

AND THEREBY SET YOUR PRICE.

BE HARD OF HEART, BECAUSE

THE STONE MUST LEAVE YOUR HAND.

ALTHOUGH YOU LIBERATE

PURE AND EXPENSIVE FIRES

FIT TO ENAMOR SHEBAS,

KEEP YOUR DESIRE APART.

LOVE ONLY WHAT YOU DO,

AND NOT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

BE PROUD, WHEN YOU HAVE SET

THE FINAL SPOKE OF FLAME

IN THAT PRISMATIC WHEEL,

AND NOTHING’S LEFT THIS DAY

EXCEPT TO SEE THE SUN

SHINE ON THE FALSE AND THE TRUE,

AND KNOW THAT AFRICA

WILL YIELD YOU MORE TO DO.

AT MAJORITY

FOR C.

WHEN YOU ARE OLD AND BEAUTIFUL,

AND THINGS MOST DIFFICULT ARE DONE,

THERE WILL BE FEW WHO CAN RECALL

YOUR FACE THAT I SEE RAVAGED NOW

BY YOUTH AND ITS OPPRESSIVE WORK.

YOUR LOOK WILL HOLD THEIR WONDERING LOOKS

GRAVE AS CORDELIA’S AT THE LAST,

NEITHER WITH RANCOR AT THE PAST

NOR TO UPBRAID THE COMING TIME.

FOR YOU WILL BE AT PEACE WITH TIME.

BUT NOW, A DAILY WARFARE TAKES

ITS TOLL OF TENDERNESS IN YOU,

AND YOU MUST LIVE LIKE CAPTAINS WHO

WAIT OUT THE HOUR BEFORE THE CHARGE—

FEARFUL, AND YET IMPATIENT TOO.

YET SOMEDAY THIS WILL HAVE AN END,

ALL CHOICES MADE OR CHOICE RESIGNED,

AND IN YOUR FACE THE LITERAL EYE

TRACE LITTLE OF YOUR HISTORY,

NOR EVER PIECE THE TALE ENTIRE

OF VILLAGES THAT HAD TO BURN

AND PLAYGROUNDS OF THE WILL DESTROYED

BEFORE YOU COULD BE SAFE FROM TIME

AND GATHER IN YOUR BROW AND AIR

THE STILLNESS OF ANTIQUITY.

1954

FROM MORNING-GLORY TO
PETERSBURG

(THE WORLD BOOK, 1928)

“ORGANIZED KNOWLEDGE IN STORY AND PICTURE”

CONFRONTS THROUGH DUSTY GLASS

AN EYE GROWN DUBIOUS.

I CAN RECALL WHEN KNOWLEDGE STILL WAS PURE,

NOT CONTRADICTORY, PLEASURABLE

AS CUTTING OUT A PAPER DOLL.

YOU OPENED UP A BOOK AND THERE IT WAS:

EVERYTHING JUST AS PROMISED, FROM

KURDISTAN TO MORMONS, GUM

ARABIC TO KUMQUAT, NEITHER MORE NOR LESS.

FACTS COULD BE KEPT SEPARATE

BY A CONVENTION; THAT WAS WHAT

MADE CHILDHOOD POSSIBLE. NOW KNOWLEDGE FINDS ME OUT;

IN ALL ITS RISIBLE UNTIDINESS

IT TRACES ME TO EACH ADDRESS,

DRAGGING IN THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT.

I DON’T INVITE WHAT FACTS CAN BE

HELD AT ARM’S LENGTH; A FAMILY

OF JEERING IRRESPONSIBLES ALWAYS

COMES ALONG GYPSY-STYLE

AND THERE YOU HAVE THEM ALL

FOREVER ON YOUR HANDS. IT NEVER PAYS.

IF I COULD STILL EXTRAPOLATE

THE MORNING-GLORY ON THE GATE

FROM PETERSBURG IN HISTORY—BUT IT’S TOO LATE.

1954

RURAL REFLECTIONS

THIS IS THE GRASS YOUR FEET ARE PLANTED ON.

YOU PAINT IT ORANGE OR YOU SING IT GREEN,

BUT YOU HAVE NEVER FOUND

A WAY TO MAKE THE GRASS MEAN WHAT YOU MEAN.

A CLOUD CAN BE WHATEVER YOU INTEND:

OSTRICH OR LEANING TOWER OR STARING EYE.

BUT YOU HAVE NEVER FOUND

A CLOUD SUFFICIENT TO EXPRESS THE SKY.

GET OUT THERE WITH YOUR SPLENDID EXPERTISE;

RAYMOND WHO CUTS THE MEADOW DOES NO LESS.

INHUMAN NATURE SAYS:

INHUMAN PATIENCE IS THE TRUE SUCCESS.

HUMAN IMPATIENCE TRIPS YOU AS YOU RUN;

STAND STILL AND YOU MUST LIE.

IT IS THE GRASS THAT CUTS THE MOWER DOWN;

IT IS THE CLOUD THAT SWALLOWS UP THE SKY.

1956

THE KNIGHT

A KNIGHT RIDES INTO THE NOON,

AND HIS HELMET POINTS TO THE SUN,

AND A THOUSAND SPLINTERED SUNS

ARE THE GAIETY OF HIS MAIL.

THE SOLES OF HIS FEET GLITTER

AND HIS PALMS FLASH IN REPLY,

AND UNDER HIS CRACKLING BANNER

HE RIDES LIKE A SHIP IN SAIL.

A KNIGHT RIDES INTO THE NOON,

AND ONLY HIS EYE IS LIVING,

A LUMP OF BITTER JELLY

SET IN A METAL MASK,

BETRAYING RAGS AND TATTERS

THAT CLING TO THE FLESH BENEATH

AND WEAR HIS NERVES TO RIBBONS

UNDER THE RADIANT CASQUE.

WHO WILL UNHORSE THIS RIDER

AND FREE HIM FROM BETWEEN

THE WALLS OF IRON, THE EMBLEMS

CRUSHING HIS CHEST WITH THEIR WEIGHT?

WILL THEY DEFEAT HIM GENTLY,

OR LEAVE HIM HURLED ON THE GREEN,

HIS RAGS AND WOUNDS STILL HIDDEN

UNDER THE GREAT BREASTPLATE?

1957

THE LOSER

A MAN THINKS OF THE WOMAN HE ONCE LOVED:
FIRST, AFTER HER WEDDING, AND THEN NEARLY A DECADE LATER.

I.

I KISSED YOU, BRIDE AND LOST, AND WENT

HOME FROM THAT BOURGEOIS SACRAMENT,

YOUR CHEEK STILL TASTING COLD UPON

MY LIPS THAT GAVE YOU BENISON

WITH ALL THE SWAGGER THAT THEY KNEW—

AS LOSERS SOMEHOW LEARN TO DO.

YOUR WEDDING MADE MY EYES ACHE; SOON

THE WORLD WOULD BE WORSE OFF FOR ONE

MORE GOLDEN APPLE DROPPED TO GROUND

WITHOUT THE LEAST PROTESTING SOUND,

AND YOU WOULD WINDFALL LIE, AND WE

FORGET YOUR SHIMMER ON THE TREE.

BEAUTY IS ALWAYS WASTED: IF

NOT MIGNON’S SONG SUNG TO THE DEAF,

AT ALL EVENTS TO THE UNMOVED.

A FACE LIKE YOURS CANNOT BE LOVED

LONG OR SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

ALMOST, WE SEEM TO HOLD IT OFF.

II.

WELL, YOU ARE TOUGHER THAN I THOUGHT.

NOW WHEN THE WASH WITH ICE HANGS TAUT

THIS MORNING OF ST. VALENTINE,

I SEE YOU STRIP THE SQUEAKING LINE,

YOUR BODY WEIGHED AGAINST THE LOAD,

AND ALL MY GROANS CAN DO NO GOOD.

BECAUSE YOU STILL ARE BEAUTIFUL,

THOUGH SQUARED AND STIFFENED BY THE PULL

OF WHAT NINE WINDY YEARS HAVE DONE.

YOU HAVE THREE DAUGHTERS, LOST A SON.

I SEE ALL YOUR INTELLIGENCE

FLUNG INTO THAT UNWEARIED STANCE.

MY ENVY IS OF NO AVAIL.

I TURN MY HEAD AND WISH HIM WELL

WHO CHAFED YOUR BEAUTY INTO USE

AND LIVES FOREVER IN A HOUSE

LIT BY THE FRICTION OF YOUR MIND.

YOU STAGGER IN AGAINST THE WIND.

1958

THE ABSENT-MINDED
ARE ALWAYS TO BLAME

WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR DOWN THERE

IN THE CRACKS OF THE PAVEMENT? OR UP THERE

BETWEEN THE PINEAPPLE AND THE ACANTHUS LEAF

IN THAT UNINSPIRED ORNAMENT? ODYSSEUS

WADING HALF-NAKED OUT OF THE SHRUBBERY

LIKE A GOD, DEAD SERIOUS AMONG THOSE AT PLAY,

COULD HARDLY BE MORE OUT OF IT. IN SCHOOL

WE STRIPED YOUR BACK WITH CHALK, YOU ALL OBLIVIOUS,

YOUR EYES HARNESSED BY A TRANSPARENT STRAND

REACHING THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS, OR DOWN

LIKE A WELLCHAIN TO THE CENTER OF EARTH.

NOW WITH THOSE SAME EYES YOU PULL THE

PAVEMENTS UP LIKE OLD LINOLEUM,

ARCHES OF TRIUMPH START TO LIQUEFY

MINUTES AFTER YOU SLOWLY TURN AWAY.

1958

EURYCLEA’S TALE

I HAVE TO WEEP WHEN I SEE IT, THE GROWN BOY FRETTING

FOR A FATHER DAWDLING AMONG THE ISLES,

AND THE SEASCAPE HOLLOWED OUT BY THAT BOY’S EDGED GAZE

TO RECEIVE ONE SPECK, ONE ONLY, FOR YEARS AND YEARS WITHHELD.

AND THAT SPECK, THAT CURIOUS MAN, HAS KEPT FROM HOME

TILL HOME WOULD SEEM THE FORBIDDEN PLACE, TILL BLOOD

AND THE TEARS OF AN OLD WOMAN MUST RUN DOWN

TO SATISFY THE GENIUS OF PLACE. EVEN THEN, WHAT

CAN THEY DO TOGETHER, FATHER AND SON?

THE DRIFTWOOD STRANGER AND THE ROOTED BOY

WHOSE EYES WILL HAVE NOTHING THEN TO ASK THE SEA.

BUT ALL THE TIME AND EVERYWHERE

LIES IN AMBUSH FOR THE DISTRACTED EYEBALL

LIGHT: LIGHT ON THE SHIP RACKED UP IN PORT,

THE CHIMNEY-STONES, THE SCAR WHITER THAN SMOKE,

THAN HER FLANKS, HER HAIR, THAT TRUE BUT AGING BRIDE.

1958

SEPTEMBER 21

WEAR THE WEIGHT OF EQUINOCTIAL EVENING,

LIGHT LIKE MELONS BRUISED ON ALL THE PORCHES.

FEEL THE HOUSES TENDERLY APPRAISE YOU,

HOLD YOU IN THE WATCHFULNESS OF MOTHERS.

ONCE THE NIGHTTIME WAS A MILKY RIVER

WASHING PAST THE SWIMMERS IN THE SUNSET,

RINSING OVER SLEEPERS OF THE MORNING.

SOON THE NIGHT WILL BE AN EYELESS QUARRY

WHERE THE SHRUNKEN DAYLIGHT AND ITS REBELS,

LOOSENED,DIVE LIKE STONES IN PERFECT SILENCE,

NAMES AND VOICES DROWN WITHOUT REFLECTION.

THEN THE HOUSES DRAW YOU. THEN THEY HAVE YOU.

1958

AFTER A SENTENCE
IN “MALTE LAURIDS BRIGGE”

THE MONTH’S EYE BLURS.

THE WINTER’S LUNGS ARE CRACKED.

ALONG BLOATED GUTTERS RACE,

SHREDDED, YOUR INJURED LEGIONS,

THE WASTE OF OUR REMORSELESS SEARCH.

YOUR OLD, UNUTTERED NAMES ARE HOLES

WORN IN OUR SKINS

THROUGH WHICH WE FEEL FROM TIME TO TIME

ABRASIVE WIND.

THOSE WHO ARE LOVED LIVE POORLY AND IN DANGER.

WE WHO WERE LOVED WILL NEVER

UNLIVE THAT CRIPPLING FEVER.

A DAY RETURNS, A CERTAIN WEATHER

SPLATTERS THE PANES, AND WE

ONCE MORE STARE IN THE EYE OF OUR FIRST FAILURE.

1958

SNAPSHOTS OF A DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

1.

YOU, ONCE A BELLE IN SHREVEPORT,

WITH HENNA-COLORED HAIR, SKIN LIKE A PEACHBUD,

STILL HAVE YOUR DRESSES COPIED FROM THAT TIME,

AND PLAY A CHOPIN PRELUDE

CALLED BY CORTOT: “DELICIOUS RECOLLECTIONS

FLOAT LIKE PERFUME THROUGH THE MEMORY.”

YOUR MIND NOW, MOULDERING LIKE WEDDING-CAKE,

HEAVY WITH USELESS EXPERIENCE, RICH

WITH SUSPICION, RUMOR, FANTASY,

CRUMBLING TO PIECES UNDER THE KNIFE-EDGE

OF MERE FACT. IN THE PRIME OF YOUR LIFE.

NERVY, GLOWERING, YOUR DAUGHTER

WIPES THE TEASPOONS, GROWS ANOTHER WAY.

2.

BANGING THE COFFEE-POT INTO THE SINK

SHE HEARS THE ANGELS CHIDING, AND LOOKS OUT

PAST THE RAKED GARDENS TO THE SLOPPY SKY.

ONLY A WEEK SINCE THEY SAID: HAVE NO PATIENCE.

THE NEXT TIME IT WAS: BE INSATIABLE.

THEN: SAVE YOURSELF; OTHERS YOU CANNOT SAVE.

SOMETIMES SHE’S LET THE TAPSTREAM SCALD HER ARM,

A MATCH BURN TO HER THUMBNAIL,

OR HELD HER HAND ABOVE THE KETTLE’S SNOUT

RIGHT IN THE WOOLLY STEAM. THEY ARE PROBABLY ANGELS,

SINCE NOTHING HURTS HER ANY MORE, EXCEPT

EACH MORNING’S GRIT BLOWING INTO HER EYES.

3.

A THINKING WOMAN SLEEPS WITH MONSTERS.

THE BEAK THAT GRIPS HER, SHE BECOMES. AND NATURE,

THAT SPRUNG-LIDDED, STILL COMMODIOUS

STEAMER-TRUNK OF TEMPORA AND MORES

GETS STUFFED WITH IT ALL:THE MILDEWED ORANGE-FLOWERS,

THE FEMALE PILLS, THE TERRIBLE BREASTS

OF BOADICEA BENEATH FLAT FOXES’ HEADS AND ORCHIDS.

TWO HANDSOME WOMEN, GRIPPED IN ARGUMENT,

EACH PROUD, ACUTE, SUBTLE, I HEAR SCREAM

ACROSS THE CUT GLASS AND MAJOLICA

LIKE FURIES CORNERED FROM THEIR PREY:

THE ARGUMENT AD FEMINAM, ALL THE OLD KNIVES

THAT HAVE RUSTED IN MY BACK, I DRIVE IN YOURS,

MA SEMBLABLE, MA SOEUR!

4.

KNOWING THEMSELVES TOO WELL IN ONE ANOTHER:

THEIR GIFTS NO PURE FRUITION, BUT A THORN,

THE PRICK FILED SHARP AGAINST A HINT OF SCORN …

READING WHILE WAITING

FOR THE IRON TO HEAT,

WRITING, MY LIFE HAD STOOD—A LOADED GUN—

IN THAT AMHERST PANTRY WHILE THE JELLIES BOIL AND SCUM,

OR, MORE OFTEN,

IRON-EYED AND BEAKED AND PURPOSED AS A BIRD,

DUSTING EVERYTHING ON THE WHATNOT EVERY DAY OF LIFE.

5.

DULCE RIDENS, DULCE LOQUENS,

SHE SHAVES HER LEGS UNTIL THEY GLEAM

LIKE PETRIFIED MAMMOTH-TUSK.

6.

WHEN TO HER LUTE CORINNA SINGS

NEITHER WORDS NOR MUSIC ARE HER OWN;

ONLY THE LONG HAIR DIPPING

OVER HER CHEEK, ONLY THE SONG

OF SILK AGAINST HER KNEES

AND THESE

ADJUSTED IN REFLECTIONS OF AN EYE.

POISED, TREMBLING AND UNSATISFIED, BEFORE

AN UNLOCKED DOOR, THAT CAGE OF CAGES,

TELL US, YOU BIRD, YOU TRAGICAL MACHINE—

IS THIS FERTILISANTE DOULEUR? PINNED DOWN

BY LOVE, FOR YOU THE ONLY NATURAL ACTION,

ARE YOU EDGED MORE KEEN

TO PRISE THE SECRETS OF THE VAULT? HAS NATURE SHOWN

HER HOUSEHOLD BOOKS TO YOU, DAUGHTER-IN-LAW,

THAT HER SONS NEVER SAW?

7.

“TO HAVE IN THIS UNCERTAIN WORLD SOME STAY

WHICH CANNOT BE UNDERMINED, IS

OF THE UTMOST CONSEQUENCE.”

THUS WROTE

A WOMAN, PARTLY BRAVE AND PARTLY GOOD,

WHO FOUGHT WITH WHAT SHE PARTLY UNDERSTOOD.

FEW MEN ABOUT HER WOULD OR COULD DO MORE,

HENCE SHE WAS LABELLED HARPY, SHREW AND WHORE.

8.

“YOU ALL DIE AT FIFTEEN,” SAID DIDEROT,

AND TURN PART LEGEND, PART CONVENTION.

STILL, EYES INACCURATELY DREAM

BEHIND CLOSED WINDOWS BLANKENING WITH STEAM.

DELICIOUSLY, ALL THAT WE MIGHT HAVE BEEN,

ALL THAT WE WERE—FIRE, TEARS,

WIT, TASTE, MARTYRED AMBITION—

STIRS LIKE THE MEMORY OF REFUSED ADULTERY

THE DRAINED AND FLAGGING BOSOM OF OUR MIDDLE YEARS.

9.

NOT THAT IT IS DONE WELL, BUT

THAT IT IS DONE AT ALL? YES, THINK

OF THE ODDS! OR SHRUG THEM OFF FOREVER.

THIS LUXURY OF THE PRECOCIOUS CHILD,

TIME’S PRECIOUS CHRONIC INVALID,—

WOULD WE, DARLINGS, RESIGN IT IF WE COULD?

OUR BLIGHT HAS BEEN OUR SINECURE:

MERE TALENT WAS ENOUGH FOR US—

GLITTER IN FRAGMENTS AND ROUGH DRAFTS.

SIGH NO MORE, LADIES.

TIME IS MALE

AND IN HIS CUPS DRINKS TO THE FAIR.

BEMUSED BY GALLANTRY, WE HEAR

OUR MEDIOCRITIES OVER-PRAISED,

INDOLENCE READ AS ABNEGATION,

SLATTERN THOUGHT STYLED INTUITION,

EVERY LAPSE FORGIVEN, OUR CRIME

ONLY TO CAST TOO BOLD A SHADOW

OR SMASH THE MOULD STRAIGHT OFF.

FOR THAT, SOLITARY CONFINEMENT,

TEAR GAS, ATTRITION SHELLING.

FEW APPLICANTS FOR THAT HONOR.

10.

WELL,

SHE’S LONG ABOUT HER COMING, WHO MUST BE

MORE MERCILESS TO HERSELF THAN HISTORY.

HER MIND FULL TO THE WIND, I SEE HER PLUNGE

BREASTED AND GLANCING THROUGH THE CURRENTS,

TAKING THE LIGHT UPON HER

AT LEAST AS BEAUTIFUL AS ANY BOY

OR HELICOPTER,

POISED, STILL COMING,

HER FINE BLADES MAKING THE AIR WINCE

BUT HER CARGO

NO PROMISE THEN:

DELIVERED

PALPABLE

OURS.

1958–1960

PASSING ON

THE LANDLORD’S HAMMER IN THE YARD

PATCHES A PORCH WHERE YOUR SHIRTS SWING

BRASHLY AGAINST MAY’S CREAMY BLUE.

THIS YEAR THE FORSYTHIA RAN WILD,

CHROME SPLASHED ON THE SPRING EVENINGS,

EVERY BUSH A PILE OF SULPHUR.

NOW, RAGGED, THEY BEND

UNDER THE LATE WIND’S ONSLAUGHT, TOUSLED

AS MY HEAD BENEATH THE CLOTHESLINES.

SOON WE’LL BE OFF. I’LL PACK US INTO PARCELS,

STUFF US IN BARRELS, SHROUD US IN NEWSPAPERS,

PAUSING TO MARVEL AT OLD BARGAIN SALES:

OH, ALL THE CHANCES WE NEVER SEIZED!

EMPTINESS ROUND THE STOOP OF THE HOUSE

MINCES, CATWISE, WAITING FOR AN IN.

1959

THE RAVEN

IF, ANTIQUE HATEFUL BIRD,

FLAPPING THROUGH DAWNGAGGED STREETS

OF METAL SHOPFRONTS GRATED DOWN

ON PEDESTRIAN NERVE-ENDS,

IF, AS ON OLD FILM,

MY FEATURES BLURRED AND GRAINED LIKE CEREAL,

YOU FIND ME WALKING UP AND DOWN

WAITING FOR MY FIRST DREAM,

DON’T TRY TO SULLY MY HEAD

WITH VENGEFUL SQUIRTINGS. FLY ON,

RATFOOTED CAUTIONARY OF MY DARK,

TILL WE MEET FURTHER ALONG.

YOU ARE NO DREAM, OLD GENIUS.

I SMELL YOU, GET MY TEETH ON EDGE,

STAND IN MY SWEAT—IN MERCURY—

EVEN AS YOU PRIME YOUR FEATHERS AND SET SAIL.

1959

MERELY TO KNOW

I.

WEDGED IN BY EARTHWORKS

THROWN UP BY SNOUTERS BEFORE ME,

I KICK AND SNUFFLE, BREATHING IN

COBWEBS OF BEETLE-CUIRASS:

VAINGLORY OF POLISHED GREEN,

INFALLIBLE PINCER, RESONANT NERVE,

A THICKENING ON THE AIR NOW,

CONFUSION TO MY LUNGS, NO MORE.

MY PREDECESSORS BLIND ME—

THEIR ZEAL EXHAUSTED AMONG ROOTS AND TUNNELS,

THEY GASPED AND LOOKED UP ONCE OR TWICE

INTO THE BEECHTREE’S NIGHTBLACK GLITTER.

II.

LET ME TAKE YOU BY THE HAIR

AND DRAG YOU BACKWARD TO THE LIGHT,

THERE SPONGELIKE PRESS MY GAZE

PATIENTLY UPON YOUR EYES,

HOLD LIKE A PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATE

AGAINST YOU MY ENORMOUS QUESTION.

WHAT IF YOU CRINGE, WHAT IF YOU WEEP?

SUFFER THIS AND YOU NEED SUFFER

NOTHING MORE. I’LL GIVE YOU BACK

YOURSELF AT LAST TO THE LAST PART.

I TAKE NOTHING, ONLY LOOK.

CHANGE NOTHING. HAVE NO NEED TO CHANGE.

MERELY TO KNOW AND LET YOU GO.

1959

III.

SPIRIT LIKE WATER

MOLDED BY UNSEEN STONE

AND SANDBAR, PLEATS AND FUNNELS

ACCORDING TO ITS OWN

SUBMERGED NECESSITY—

TO THE INDOLENT EYE

PURE WILLFULNESS, TO THE STRAY

PINE-NEEDLE BOILING

IN THAT CASCADE-BENT POOL

A RANDOM FURY: LAW,

IF THAT’S WHAT’S WANTED, LIES

ASKING TO BE READ

IN THE DRIED BROOK-BED.

1961

ANTINOÜS: THE DIARIES

AUTUMN TORTURE. THE OLD SIGNS

SMEARED ON THE PAVEMENT, SOPPING LEAVES

RUBBED INTO THE LANDSCAPE AS UNGUENT ON A BRUISE,

BROUGHT INDOORS, EVEN, AS THEY BRING FLOWERS, ENORMOUS,

WITH THE COLORS OF THE BODY’S SECRET PARTS.

ALL THIS. AND THEN, EVENINGS, NEEDING TO BE OUT,

WALKING FAST, FIGHTING THE FIRE

THAT MUST DIE, LIGHT THAT SETS MY TEETH ON EDGE WITH JOY,

TILL ON THE BLACK EMBANKMENT

I’M A CART STOPPED IN THE RUTS OF TIME.

THEN AT SOME HOUSE THE RUMOR OF TRUTH AND BEAUTY

SATURATES A ROOM LIKE LILAC-WATER

IN THE STREAM OF A BATH, FIRES SNAP, HEADS ARE HIGH,

GOLD HAIR AT NAPES OF NECKS, GOLD IN GLASSES,

GOLD IN THE THROAT, POETRY OF FURS AND MANNERS.

WHY DO I SHIVER THEN? HAVEN’T I SEEN,

OVER AND OVER, BEFORE THE END OF AN EVENING,

THE THREE OPENED COFFINS CARRIED IN AND LEFT IN A CORNER?

HAVEN’T I WATCHED AS SOMEBODY CRACKED HIS SHIN

ON ONE OF THEM, WINCED AND HOPPED AND LIMPED

LAUGHING TO LAY HIS HAND ON A BEAUTIFUL ARM

STRIATED WITH HAIRS OF GOLD, LIKE AN ALMOND-SHELL?

THE OLD, NEEDLESS STORY. FOR IF I’M HERE

IT IS BY CHOICE AND WHEN AT LAST

I SMELL MY OWN RISING NAUSEA, FEEL THE AIR

TIGHTEN AROUND MY STOMACH LIKE A SURGICAL BANDAGE,

I CAN’T PRETEND SURPRISE. WHAT IS IT I SO MISCARRY?

IF WHAT I SPEW ON THE TILES AT LAST,

HELPLESS, DISGRACED, ALONE,

IS IN PART WHAT I’VE SWALLOWED FROM GLASSES, EYES,

MOTIONS OF HANDS, OPENING AND CLOSING MOUTHS,

ISN’T IT ALSO DEAD GOBBETS OF MYSELF,

ABORTIVE, MURDERED, OR NEVER WILLED?

1959

JUVENILIA

YOUR IBSEN VOLUMES, VIOLET-SPINED,

EACH FLAKING ITS GOLD ARABESQUE!

AGAIN I SIT, UNDER DURESS, HANDS WASHED,

AT YOUR INKSTAINED OAKEN DESK,

BY THE GOOSE-NECK LAMP IN THE TROPIC OF YOUR BOOKS,

STABBING THE BLOTTING-PAD, DOODLING LOOP UPON LOOP,

PEERING ONE-EYED IN THE DUSTY REFLECTING MIRROR

OF YOUR STUDENT MICROSCOPE,

CRANING MY NECK TO SPELL ABOVE ME

A DOLLS HOUSELITTLE EYOLF

WHEN WE DEAD AWAKEN

UNSPEAKABLE FAIRY TALES EBB LIKE BLOOD THROUGH MY HEAD

AS I DIP THE PEN AND FOR AUNTS, FOR ADMIRING FRIENDS,

FOR YOU ABOVE ALL TO READ,

COPY MY PRAISED AND SEDULOUS LINES.

BEHIND THE TWO OF US, THIRSTY SPINES

QUIVER IN SEMI-SHADOW, HUGE LEAVES UNCURL AND THICKEN.

1960

DOUBLE MONOLOGUE

TO LIVE ILLUSIONLESS, IN THE ABANDONED MINE-

SHAFT OF DOUBT, AND STILL

MIME ILLUSIONS FOR OTHERS? A PUZZLE

FOR THE MAKER WHO HAS THOUGHT

ONCE TOO OFTEN TOO COLDLY.

SINCE I WAS MORE THAN A CHILD

TRYING ON A THOUSAND FACES

I HAVE WANTED ONE THING: TO KNOW

SIMPLY AS I KNOW MY NAME

AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, WHERE I STAND.

HOW MUCH EXPENSE OF TIME AND SKILL

WHICH MIGHT HAVE SET ITSELF

TO ANGELIC FABRICATIONS! ALL MERELY

TO CHART ONE NEEDLE IN THE HAYMOW?

FIND YOURSELF AND YOU FIND THE WORLD?

SOLEMN PRESUMPTION! MIGHTY OBJECT

NO ONE BUT ITSELF HAS MISSED,

WHAT’S LOST, IF YOU STAY LOST? SOMEONE

IGNORANTLY LOVES YOU—WILL THAT SERVE?

SHRUG THAT OFF, AND PRESTO!—

THE NEEDLE DROWNS IN THE HAYDUST.

THINK OF THE WHOLE HAYSTACK—

A COMPOSITION SO FORTUITOUS

IT ONLY LOOKS MONUMENTAL.

THERE’S ALWAYS A STRAW TWITCHING SOMEWHERE.

WAIT OUT THE LONG CHANCE, AND

YOUR NEEDLE TOO COULD GET NUDGED UP

TO THE APEX OF THAT BRISTLING CALM.

RUSTED, POSSIBLY. YOU MIGHT NOT WANT

TO SWEAR IT WAS THE OBJECT, AFTER ALL.

TIME WEARS US OLD UTOPIANS.

I NOW NO LONGER THINK

“TRUTH” IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WORDS.

TODAY, WHEN I SEE “TRUTHFUL”

WRITTEN SOMEWHERE, IT FLARES

LIKE A WHITE ORCHID IN WET WOODS,

RARE AND GRIEF-DELIGHTING, UP FROM THE PAGE.

SOMETIMES, UNWITTINGLY EVEN,

WE HAVE BEEN TRUTHFUL.

IN A RANDOM UNIVERSE, WHAT MORE

EXACT AND STARRY CONSOLATION?

DON’T THINK I THINK

FACTS SERVE BETTER THAN IGNORANT LOVE.

BOTH SERVE, AND STILL

OUR NEED MOCKS OUR GEAR.

1960

A WOMAN MOURNED BY DAUGHTERS

NOW, NOT A TEAR BEGUN,

WE SIT HERE IN YOUR KITCHEN,

SPENT, YOU SEE, ALREADY.

YOU ARE SWOLLEN TILL YOU STRAIN

THIS HOUSE AND THE WHOLE SKY.

YOU, WHOM WE SO OFTEN

SUCCEEDED IN IGNORING!

YOU, ARE PUFFED UP IN DEATH

LIKE A CORPSE PULLED FROM THE SEA;

WE GROAN BENEATH YOUR WEIGHT.

AND YET YOU WERE A LEAF,

A STRAW BLOWN ON THE BED,

YOU HAD LONG SINCE BECOME

CRISP AS A DEAD INSECT.

WHAT IS IT, IF NOT YOU,

THAT SETTLES ON US NOW

LIKE SATIN YOU PULLED DOWN

OVER OUR BRIDAL HEADS?

WHAT RISES IN OUR THROATS

LIKE FOOD YOU PRODDED IN?

NOTHING COULD BE ENOUGH.

YOU BREATHE UPON US NOW

THROUGH SOLID ASSERTIONS

OF YOURSELF: TEASPOONS, GOBLETS,

SEAS OF CARPET, A FOREST

OF OLD PLANTS TO BE WATERED,

AN OLD MAN IN AN ADJOINING

ROOM TO BE TOUCHED AND FED.

AND ALL THIS UNIVERSE

DARES US TO LAY A FINGER

ANYWHERE, SAVE EXACTLY

AS YOU WOULD WISH IT DONE.

1960

READINGS OF HISTORY

HE DELIGHTED IN RELATING THE FACT THAT HE HAD BEEN BORN

NEAR GIRGENTI IN A PLACE CALLED CHAOS DURING A RAGING

CHOLERA EPIDEMIC.

—DOMENICO VITTORINI, THE DRAMA OF LUIGI PIRANDELLO

I. THE EVIL EYE

LAST NIGHT WE SAT WITH THE STEREOPTICON,

LAUGHING AT GENRE VIEWS OF 1906,

TILL SUDDENLY, GAZING STRAIGHT INTO

THAT FRINGED AND TASSELED PARLOR, WHERE THE VESTAL

SPURNS AN UNLIKELY SUITOR

WITH HAIRY-CRESTED PLANTS TO RIGHT AND LEFT,

MY HEART SANK. IT WAS TERRIBLE.

I SMELLED THE MILDEW IN THOSE SWAGS OF PLUSH,

DUST ON THE EYEPIECE BLOOMED TO FREAKS OF MOLD.

I KNEW BEYOND ALL DOUBT HOW DEAD THAT COUPLE WAS.

TODAY, A FRESH CLEAN MORNING.

YOUR CAMERA STABS ME UNAWARES,

RIGHT IN MY MORTAL PART.

A WOMB OF CELLULOID ALREADY

CONTAINS MY DOTAGE AND MY TOTAL ABSENCE.

II. THE CONFRONTATION

LUIGI PIRANDELLO

LOOKED LIKE AN OLD HISTORIAN

(OVAL HEAD, TUFTED WHITE BEARD,

NOT LEAST THE HUNGER

FOR RECONCILIATION IN HIS EYE).

FOR FOURTEEN YEARS, FACING

HIS CRIMINAL REFLECTION

IN HIS WIFE’S GRAND GUIGNOL MIND,

HE BUILT OVER AND OVER

THAT HALL OF MIRRORS

IN WHICH TO BE APPEARS

TO BE PERCEIVED.

THE PRESENT HOLDS YOU LIKE A RAVING WIFE,

CLEVER AS THE MAD ARE CLEVER,

DIGGING UP YOUR SECRET TRUTHS

FROM HER DISABLED GENIUS.

SHE KNOWS WHAT YOU HOPE

AND DARE NOT HOPE:

REMEMBERS

WHAT YOU’RE SICK

OF FORGETTING.

WHAT ARE YOU NOW

BUT WHAT YOU KNOW TOGETHER, YOU AND SHE?

SHE WILL NOT LET YOU THINK.

IT IS IMPORTANT

TO MAKE CONNECTIONS. EVERYTHING

HAPPENS VERY FAST IN THE MINDS

OF THE INSANE. EVEN YOU

AREN’T UP TO THAT, YET.

GO OUT, WALK,

THINK OF SELVES LONG PAST.

III. MEMORABILIA

I RECALL

CIVIL WAR LETTERS OF A GREAT-GRAND-UNCLE,

FIFTEEN AT CHANCELLORSVILLE,

NO RACONTEUR,

NO SPELLER, EITHER; NOR TO PUT IT SQUARELY,

MUCH OF A MIND;

THE MOST WE GATHER

IS THAT HE DID WRITE HOME:

I AM WELL,

HOW ARE MY SISTERS, HOPE YOU ARE THE SAME.

DID SPARTAN BATTLE-ECHOES RACK HIS HEAD?

DYING, HE TURNED INTO HIS FATHER’S MEMORY.

HISTORY’S QUEERLY STRONG PERFUMES

RISE FROM THE CROOK OF THIS DAY’S ELBOW:

SEDUCTION FANTASIES OF THE PUBLIC MIND,

OR DILTHEY’S DREAM FROM WHICH HE ROUSED TO SEE

THE COSMOS GLARING THROUGH HIS WINDOWPANE?

PRISONERS OF WHAT WE THINK OCCURRED,

OR DREAMERS DREAMING TOWARD A FINAL WORD?

WHAT, IN FACT, HAPPENED IN THESE WOODS

ON SOME OBLITERATED AFTERNOON?

IV. CONSANGUINITY

CAN HISTORY SHOW US NOTHING

BUT PIECES OF OURSELVES, DETACHED,

SET TO A KIND OF POETRY,

A KIND OF MUSIC, EVEN?

SEATED TODAY ON GRANDMAMMA’S

PLUSH SOFA WITH THE GRAPES

BURSTING SO RIPELY FROM THE CURVED MAHOGANY,

WE READ THE GREAT VICTORIANS

WEEPING, ALMOST, AS IF

SOME FAMILY BREACH WERE HEALED.

THOSE ANGRY GIANTESSES AND GIANTS,

LATELY OUR KITH AND KIN!

WE STARE INTO THEIR FACES, HEAR

AT LAST WHAT THEY WERE SAYING

(OR SOME VERSION NOT BRUITED

BY FILIAL IRRITATION).

THE CAT-TAILS WITHER IN THE READING-ROOM.

TOBACCO-COLORED DUST

DRIFTS ON THE NEWEST MAGAZINES.

I LOAF HERE LEAFING ANCIENT COPIES

OF LIFE FROM WORLD WAR II.

WE LOOK SO POOR AND HONEST THERE:

GIRLS WITH LONG HAIR BADLY COMBED

AND UNBECOMING DRESSES—

WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

YOU SAIL

TO SHOP IN EUROPE, IGNORANTLY FREED

FOR YOU, AN AGE AGO.

YOUR NYLON LUGGAGE MATCHES

EYELIDS

EXPERTLY AZURED.

I, TOO, HAVE LIVED IN HISTORY.

V. THE MIRROR

IS IT IN HOPES

TO FIND OR LOSE MYSELF

THAT I

FILL UP MY TABLE NOW

WITH MICHELET AND MOTLEY?

TO “KNOW HOW IT WAS”

OR TO FORGET HOW IT IS—

WHAT ELSE?

SPLIT AT THE ROOT, NEITHER GENTILE NOR JEW,

YANKEE NOR REBEL, BORN

IN THE FACE OF TWO ANCIENT CULTS,

I’M A GOOD READER OF HISTORIES.

AND YOU,

MORRIS COHEN, DEAR TO ME AS A BROTHER,

WHEN YOU SIT AT NIGHT

TRACING YOUR WAY THROUGH YOUR VOLUMES

OF JOSEPHUS, OR ANY

OF THE OLD JUDAIC CHRONICLES,

DO YOU FIND YOURSELF THERE, A SIMPLER,

MORE ELOQUENT JEW?

OR DO YOU READ

TO SHUT OUT THE TICK-TOCK OF SELF,

THE QUESTIONS AND THEIR ROUTINE ANSWERS?

VI. THE COVENANT

THE PRESENT BREAKS OUR HEARTS. WE LIE AND FREEZE,

OUR FINGERS ICY AS A BUNCH OF KEYS.

NOTHING WILL THAW THESE BONES EXCEPT

MEMORY LIKE AN ANCIENT BLANKET WRAPPED

ABOUT US WHEN WE SLEEP AT HOME AGAIN,

SMELLING OF PICNICS, CLOSETS, SICKNESSES,

OLD NIGHTMARE,

AND INSOMNIA’S SPREADING STAIN.

OR SAY I SIT WITH WHAT I HALFWAY KNOW

AS WITH A DYING MAN WHO HEAVES THE TRUE

VERSION AT LAST, NOW THAT IT HARDLY MATTERS,

OR GROPES A HAND TO WHERE THE LETTERS

SEWN IN THE MATTRESS CAN BE PLUCKED AND READ.

HERE’S WATER.SLEEP.NO MORE IS ASKED OF YOU.

I TAKE YOUR LIFE INTO MY LIVING HEAD.

1960

TO THE AIRPORT

DEATH’S TAXI CRACKLES THROUGH THE MIST. THE CHEEKS

OF DIAMOND BATTLEMENTS FLUSH HIGH AND COLD.

ALARM CLOCKS STRIKE A MILLION SPARKS OF WILL.

WEEPING:ALL NIGHT WE’VE WEPT AND WATCHED THE HOURS

THAT NEVER WILL BE OURS AGAIN: NOW

WEEPING, WE ROLL THROUGH UNFORGETTABLE

ZION, THAT REARS ITS GOLDEN HEAD FROM SLEEP

TO ACT, AND DOES NOT NEED US AS WE WEEP.

YOU DREAMED US, CITY, AND YOU LET US BE.

GRANDILOQUENCE, IMPROVIDENCE, ORDURE, LIGHT,

HOURS THAT SEEMED YEARS, AND OURS—AND OVER ALL

THE ENDLESS WING OF POSSIBILITY,

THAT MACKEREL HEAVEN OF YOURS, FRETTED WITH ALL

OUR WITS COULD LEAP FOR, ENVY BATTEN ON.

OUR FLIGHTS TAKE OFF FROM YOU INTO THE SEA;

NOTHING YOU NEED WASTES, THOUGH WE THINK WE DO.

YOU ARE CANAAN NOW AND WE ARE LIFTED HIGH

TO SEE ALL WE WERE PROMISED, NEVER KNEW.

1960

THE AFTERWAKE

NURSING YOUR NERVES

TO REST, I’VE ROUSED MY OWN; WELL,

NOW FOR A FEW BAD HOURS!

SLEEP SEES YOU BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

ALONE, I SLUMP IN HIS FRONT PARLOR.

YOU’RE SAFE INSIDE. GOOD. BUT I’M

LIKE A MIDWIFE WHO AT DAWN

HAS ALL IN ORDER: BLOODSTAINS

WASHED UP, TEAPOT ON THE STOVE,

AND STARTS HER FIVE MILES HOME

WALKING, THE BIRTHYELL STILL

EXPLODING IN HER HEAD.

YES, I’M WITH HER NOW: HERE’S

THE STREAKED, LIVID ROAD

EDGED WITH SHUT HOUSES

BREATHING NIGHT OUT AND IN.

LEGS TIGHT WITH FATIGUE,

WE MOVE UNDER MORNING’S COAL-BLUE STAR,

COLOSSAL AS THIS LOAD

OF UNEXPIRED PURPOSE, WHICH DRAINS

SLOWLY, TILL SCISSORS OF COCKCROW SNIP THE AIR.

1961

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

TO GPS

OVER THE CHESSBOARD NOW,

YOUR ARTIFICIALITY CONCLUDES

A FINAL CHECK; RESTS; BROODS—

NO—SORTS AND STACKS A FILE OF MEMORIES,

WHILE I

CONCEDE THE VICTORY, BOW,

AND SLOUCH AMONG MY FREE ASSOCIATIONS.

YOU NEVER HAD A MOTHER,

LET’S SAY? NO DIGITAL GERTRUDE

WHOM YOU’D AS LIEF HAVE SEEN

KINGLESS? SO YOUR WHITE QUEEN

WAS JUST AN “OPERATOR.”

(MY RED HAD INCANDESCENCE,

IRE, AURA, FLARE,

AND TRAPPED ME SEVERAL MOMENTS IN HER STARE.)

I’M SULKING, CLEARLY, IN THE GREAT TRADITION

OF HUMAN WASTE. WHY NOT

DUMP THE WHOLE REEKING SNARL

AND LET YOU SOLVE ME ONCE FOR ALL?

(PARAMETER: A BLACK-FACED LUDDITE

ITCHING FOR ECSTASIES OF SABOTAGE.)

STILL, WHEN

THEY MAKE YOU WRITE YOUR POEMS, LATER ON,

WHO’D ENVY YOU, FORCE-FED

ON ALL THOSE VARIORUM

EDITIONS OF OUR PRIMITIVE ENDEAVORS,

THOSE FROZEN PEMMICAN LANGUAGE-RATIONS

THEY’LL CRAM YOU WITH? DENIED

OUR LUXURY OF NAUSEA, YOU

FORGET NOTHING, HAVE NO DREAMS.

1961

A MARRIAGE IN THE ’SIXTIES

AS SOLID-SEEMING AS ANTIQUITY,

YOU FROWN ABOVE

THE NEW YORK SUNDAY TIMES

WHERE CASTRO, LIKE A WALK-ON OUT OF CARMEN,

MUTTERS INTO A BEARDED HENCHMAN’S EAR.

THEY SAY THE SECOND’S GETTING SHORTER—

I KNEW IT IN MY BONES—

AND PIECES OF THE UNIVERSE ARE MISSING.

I FEEL THE GEARS OF THIS LATE AFTERNOON

SLIP, COG BY COG, EVEN AS I READ.

“I’M OLD,” WE BOTH COMPLAIN,

HALF-LAUGHING, OFTENER NOW.

TIME SERVES YOU WELL. THAT FACE—

PART ROMAN EMPEROR, PART RAIMU—

NOTHING THIS SIDE OF ABSENCE CAN UNDO.

BLISS, REVULSION, YOUR RARE ANGERS CAN

ONLY CARRY THROUGH WHAT’S WELL BEGUN.

WHEN

I READ YOUR LETTERS LONG AGO

IN THAT HALF-DEFUNCT

HOTEL IN MAGDALEN STREET

EVERY WORD PRIMED MY NERVES.

A GEOGRAPHICAL MISERY

COMPOSED OF OCEANS, FOGBOUND PLANES

AND MISDELIVERED CABLEGRAMS

LAY ROUND ME, A NOVA ZEMBLA

ONLY YOUR LIVE BREATH COULD UNFREEZE.

TODAY WE STALK

IN THE RAGING DESERT OF OUR THOUGHT

WHOSE SINGLE DROP OF MERCY IS

EACH KNOWS THE OTHER THERE.

TWO STRANGERS, THRUST FOR LIFE UPON A ROCK,

MAY HAVE AT LAST THE PERFECT HOUR OF TALK

THAT LANGUAGE ACHES FOR; STILL—

TWO MINDS, TWO MESSAGES.

YOUR BROWS KNIT INTO FLOURISHES. SOME PIECE

OF MERE TIME HAS YOU TANGLED THERE.

SOME MOTE OF HISTORY HAS FLOWN INTO YOUR EYE.

WILL NOTHING EVER BE THE SAME,

EVEN OUR QUARRELS TAKE A DIFFERENT KEY,

OUR DREAMS EXHUME NEW METAPHORS?

THE WORLD BREATHES UNDERNEATH OUR BED.

DON’T LOOK. WE’RE AT EACH OTHER’S MERCY TOO.

DEAR FELLOW-PARTICLE, ELECTRIC DUST

I’M BLOWN WITH—ANCESTOR

TO WHAT EUPHORIC CLUSTER—

SEE HOW PARTICULARITY DISSOLVES

IN ALL THAT HINTS OF CHAOS. LET ONE FINGER

HOVER TOWARD YOU FROM THERE

AND SEE THIS FURIOUS GRAIN

SUSPEND ITS DANCE TO HANG

BESIDE YOU LIKE YOUR TWIN.

1961

FIRST THINGS

I CAN’T NAME LOVE NOW

WITHOUT NAMING ITS OBJECT—

THIS THE FINAL MEASURE

OF THOSE FLINTSPARK YEARS

WHEN ONE BELIEVED

ONE’S FLASH INNATE.

TODAY I SWEAR

ONLY IN THE SUN’S EYE

DO I TAKE FIRE.

1961

ATTENTION

THE ICE AGE IS HERE.

I SIT BURNING CIGARETTES,

BURNING MY BRAIN.

A MICRO-TIBET,

DEADLY, FRIVOLOUS, COMPLETE,

BLINDS THE FOUR PANES.

VEILS OF DUMB AIR

UNWIND LIKE BANDAGES

FROM MY LIPS

HALF-PARTED, STEADY AS THE MOUTHS

OF ANTIQUE STATUES.

1961

END OF AN ERA

THIS MORNING, FLAKES OF SUN

PEEL DOWN TO THE LAST SNOWHOLDS,

THE BARBED-WIRE LEAVINGS OF A WAR

LOST, WON, IN THESE DEAD-END ALLEYS.

STALE AS A WRITTEN-OUT JOURNALIST,

I SORT MY GEAR.—NOTHING IS HAPPENING.—CITY,

DUMB AS A PACK OF THUMBED CARDS, YOU

ONCE HAD SNAP AND GLARE

AND SECRET LIFE; NOW, TREMBLING

UNDER MY FIVE GREY SENSES’ WEIGHT,

YOU FLATTEN

ONTO THE TABLE.

BAUDELAIRE, I THINK OF YOU … NOTHING CHANGES,

RUDE AND SELF-ABSORBED THE CURRENT

DASHES PAST, REFLECTING NOTHING, POETRY

EXTENDS ITS UNSOUGHT AMNESTY,

THE ROOTS OF THE GREAT GROVE

ATROPHY UNDERGROUND.

SOME VOICES, THOUGH, SHAKE IN THE AIR LIKE HEAT.

THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS CHANGING,

EVEN THE NEIGHBORS ARE GROWN, METHINKS, PECULIAR.

I WALK INTO MY HOUSE AND SEE

TOURISTS FINGERING THIS AND THAT.

MY MIRRORS, MY BRIC-À-BRAC

DON’T SUIT THEIR STYLE.

THOSE OLD FRIENDS, THOUGH,

ALIVE AND DEAD,

FOR WHOM THINGS DON’T COME EASY—

CERTAIN FORESTS ARE SAWDUST,

FROM NOW ON HAVE TO BE DESCRIBED?

NOTHING CHANGES. THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTHS

ARE STILL IN THE EARTH.

1961

RUSTICATION

IN A GIGANTIC POT DE CHAMBRE, SCROLLED

WITH ROSES, PURCHASED DEARLY AT AUCTION,

GOLDENROD AND ASTERS SPILL

TOWARD THE INEVITABLE SUNSET.

THE HOUSEGUESTS TRAIL FROM SWIMMING

UNDER HUGE TOWELS.

MARIANNE DANGLES BAREFOOT IN THE HAMMOCK

READING ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER KING.

VIVALDI RATTLES ON THE PHONOGRAPH,

FLUTES RICOCHETING OFF THE BIRCHTREES.

FLIES BUZZ AND ARE GAILY MURDERED.

STILL OUT OF IT, AND GUILTY,

I GLUE THE DISTANCE-GLASSES TO MY EYES

OSTRICH-LIKE, HOPING

YOU’LL THINK ME IN THAT CLEARING HALF A MILE AWAY.

OFFSTAGE I HEAR

THE OLD TIME-KILLERS DRESSING, BANGING DOORS,

YOUR VOICE, A TIMBRE OR TWO TOO RICH FOR LOVE,

CHEERING THEM ON.

A KESTREL SAILS INTO MY FIELD OF VISION,

CLEAR AS A RISING STAR.

WHY SHOULD I NEED TO QUARREL

WITH ANOTHER’S CONSOLATIONS?

WHY, IN YOUR MORTAL SKIN,

VIGOROUSLY SMASHING ICE AND SMOKING,

A GRAYING PIGTAIL DOWN YOUR BACK,

SHOULD YOU SEEM INFAMOUS TO ME?

1961

APOLOGY

I’VE SAID: I WOULDN’T EVER

KEEP A CAT, A DOG,

A BIRD—

CHIEFLY BECAUSE

I’D RATHER LOVE MY EQUALS.

TODAY, TURNING

IN THE FOG OF MY MIND,

I KNEW, THE THING I REALLY

COULDN’T STAND IN THE HOUSE

IS A WOMAN

WITH A MINDFUL OF FOG

AND BLOODLETTING CLAWS

AND THE NERVES OF A BIRD

AND THE NIGHTMARES OF A DOG.

1961

SISTERS

CAN I EASILY SAY,

I KNOW YOU OF COURSE NOW,

NO LONGER THE FELLOW-VICTIM,

READER OF MY DIARIES, HEIR

TO MY OUTGROWN DRESSES,

EAR FOR MY POEMS AND INVECTIVES?

DO I KNOW YOU BETTER

THAN THAT BLUE-EYED STRANGER

SELF-ABSORBED AS MYSELF

RAPTLY KNITTING OR SLEEPING

THROUGH A THIRDCLASS WINTER JOURNEY?

FACE TO FACE ALL NIGHT

HER DREAMS AND WHIMPERS

TANGLED WITH MINE,

SLEEPING BUT NOT ASLEEP

BEHIND THE ENGINE DRILLING

INTO DARK GERMANY,

HER EYES, MOUTH, HEAD

RECONSTRUCTED BY DAWN

AS WE NODDED FAREWELL.

HER I SHOULD RECOGNIZE

YEARS LATER, ANYWHERE.

1961

IN THE NORTH

MULISH, UNREGENERATE,

NOT “AS ALL MEN ARE”

BUT MORE THAN MOST

YOU SIT UP THERE IN THE SUNSET;

THERE ARE ONLY THREE

HOURS OF DARK

IN YOUR NIGHT. YOU ARE

ALONE AS AN OLD KING

WITH HIS WHITE-GOLD BEARD

WHEN IN SUMMER THE SHIPS

SAIL OUT, THE HEROES

SINGING, PUSH OFF

FOR OTHER LANDS. ONLY

IN WINTER WHEN

TRAPPED IN THE ICE

YOUR KINGDOM FLASHES

UNDER THE NORTHERN LIGHTS

AND THE BEES DREAM

IN THEIR HIVES, THE YOUNG

MEN LIKE THE BEES

HANG NEAR YOU

FOR LACK OF ANOTHER,

REMEMBERING TOO, WITH SOME

REMORSEFUL TENDERNESS

YOU ARE THEIR KING.

1962

THE CLASSMATE

ONE YEAR, YOU GAVE US

ALL NAMES, HUDIBRASTIC

TITLES, SKYWROTE

OUR GAUDY HISTORIES.

WE WERE ALL SPARKS

STRUCK IN YOUR HEAD,

WE MOCKED BUT LISTENED.

YOU FILLED A WHOLE

ZOOLOGICAL NOTEBOOK

WITH SLY GENERATIONS

OF SHOULD-HAVE-BEENS,

WERE DISGRACED, NOT DISTRESSED.

OUR HOWLS DIED AWAY.

YOUR POETRY WAS IN

PAPER-DART BALLADS

SAILING BEYOND OUR NOSES,

IN BLACKBOARD LYRICS

SCRAWLED IN OUR OWN PATOIS,

SPIRALS OF CHALKDUST,

INKBLOT MANIFESTOS

WHO COULD READ TODAY?

YOU LESS THAN ANY.

BECAUSE LATER YOU TURNED

TO ADMIRATION OF THE CLASSICS

AND A SEDULOUS EAR.

STILL IF I HEAR

THE SLASH OF FEET

THROUGH GUTTERS FULL OF OAKLEAVES

AND SEE THE BOYS

STILL UNPRIZED, UNPRIZING,

DANCING ALONG, TOSSING

BOOKS AND DUSTY LEAVES

INTO THE SUN,

THEY CHANT, IT WOULD SEEM,

YOUR MOMENTARY QUATRAINS,

NOSE-THUMBING, FREE-LANCING

POET OF THE SCHOOLYARD—

PRIZE-GIVER AND TAKER

NOW, A PILLAR

SWADDLED IN LAURELS—

LOST CLASSMATE, LOOK!

YOUR GLORY WAS HERE.

1962

PEELING ONIONS

ONLY TO HAVE A GRIEF

EQUAL TO ALL THESE TEARS!

THERE’S NOT A SOB IN MY CHEST.

DRY-HEARTED AS PEER GYNT

I PARE AWAY, NO HERO,

MERELY A COOK.

CRYING WAS LABOR, ONCE

WHEN I’D GOOD CAUSE.

WALKING, I FELT MY EYES LIKE WOUNDS

RAW IN MY HEAD,

SO POSTAL-CLERKS, I THOUGHT, MUST STARE.

A DOG’S LOOK, A CAT’S, BURNT TO MY BRAIN—

YET ALL THAT STAYED

STUFFED IN MY LUNGS LIKE SMOG.

THESE OLD TEARS IN THE CHOPPING-BOWL.

1961

GHOST OF A CHANCE

YOU SEE A MAN

TRYING TO THINK.

YOU WANT TO SAY

TO EVERYTHING:

KEEP OFF! GIVE HIM ROOM!

BUT YOU ONLY WATCH,

TERRIFIED

THE OLD CONSOLATIONS

WILL GET HIM AT LAST

LIKE A FISH

HALF-DEAD FROM FLOPPING

AND ALMOST CRAWLING

ACROSS THE SHINGLE,

ALMOST BREATHING

THE RAW, AGONIZING

AIR

TILL A WAVE

PULLS IT BACK BLIND INTO THE TRIUMPHANT

SEA.

1962

THE WELL

DOWN THIS OLD WELL

WHAT LEAVES HAVE FALLEN,

WHAT CORES OF EATEN APPLES,

WHAT SCRAPS OF PAPER!

AN OLD TRASH BARREL.

NOVEMBER, NO ONE COMES.

BUT I COME, TRYING

TO BREATHE THAT WORD

INTO THE WELL’S EAR

WHICH COULD MAKE THE LEAVES FLY UP

LIKE A GREEN JET

TO CLOTHE THE NAKED TREE,

THE WHOLE FRUIT LEAP TO THE BOUGH,

THE SCRAPS LIKE FLEETS OF LETTERS

SAIL UP INTO MY HANDS.

LEIDEN, 1961

NOVELLA

TWO PEOPLE IN A ROOM, SPEAKING HARSHLY.

ONE GETS UP, GOES OUT TO WALK.

(THAT IS THE MAN.)

THE OTHER GOES INTO THE NEXT ROOM

AND WASHES THE DISHES, CRACKING ONE.

(THAT IS THE WOMAN.)

IT GETS DARK OUTSIDE.

THE CHILDREN QUARREL IN THE ATTIC.

SHE HAS NO BLOOD LEFT IN HER HEART.

THE MAN COMES BACK TO A DARK HOUSE.

THE ONLY LIGHT IS IN THE ATTIC.

HE HAS FORGOTTEN HIS KEY.

HE RINGS AT HIS OWN DOOR

AND HEARS SOBBING ON THE STAIRS.

THE LIGHTS GO ON IN THE HOUSE.

THE DOOR CLOSES BEHIND HIM.

OUTSIDE, SEPARATE AS MINDS,

THE STARS TOO COME ALIGHT.

1962

FACE

I COULD LOOK AT YOU A LONG TIME,

MAN OF RED AND BLUE;

YOUR EYE GLOWS MOCKINGLY

FROM THE RAINBOW-COLORED FLESH

KAREL APPEL CLOTHED YOU IN.

YOU ARE A FISH,

DRAWN UP DRIPPING HUGELY

FROM THE SEA OF PAINT,

LAID ON THE CANVAS

TO GLOWER AND FLASH

OUT OF THE BLACKNESS

THAT IS YOUR TRUE ELEMENT

1962

PROSPECTIVE
IMMIGRANTS
PLEASE NOTE

EITHER YOU WILL

GO THROUGH THIS DOOR

OR YOU WILL NOT GO THROUGH.

IF YOU GO THROUGH

THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK

OF REMEMBERING YOUR NAME.

THINGS LOOK AT YOU DOUBLY

AND YOU MUST LOOK BACK

AND LET THEM HAPPEN.

IF YOU DO NOT GO THROUGH

IT IS POSSIBLE

TO LIVE WORTHILY

TO MAINTAIN YOUR ATTITUDES

TO HOLD YOUR POSITION

TO DIE BRAVELY

BUT MUCH WILL BLIND YOU,

MUCH WILL EVADE YOU,

AT WHAT COST WHO KNOWS?

THE DOOR ITSELF

MAKES NO PROMISES.

IT IS ONLY A DOOR.

1962

LIKENESS

A GOOD MAN

IS AN ODD THING:

HARD TO FIND

AS THE SONG SAYS,

HE IS ANARCHIC

AS A MOUNTAIN FRESHET

AND UNPROTECTED

BY THE PROTECTORS.

1962

THE LAG

WITH YOU IT IS STILL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

NOTHING I KNOW WILL MAKE YOU KNOW

WHAT BIRDS CRIED ME AWAKE

OR HOW THE WET LIGHT LEAKED

INTO MY SKY.

DAY CAME AS NO CLEAR VICTORY,

IT’S RAINING STILL, BUT LIGHT

WASHES THE MENACE FROM OBSCURE FORMS

AND IN THE SHAVING MIRROR THERE’S

A FACE I RECOGNIZE.

WITH YOU IT IS STILL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

YOU HUG YOURSELF, TIGHTENED AS IN A BERTH

SUSPENDED OVER THE GRAND BANKS

WHERE TIME IS ALREADY AMERICAN

AND HANGING FIRE.

I’M OLDER NOW THAN YOU.

I FEEL YOUR BLACK DREAMS STRUGGLING AT A PORTHOLE

STUFFED FULL OF NIGHT. I FEEL YOU CHOKING

IN THAT THICK PLACE. MY WORDS

REACH YOU AS THROUGH A TELEPHONE

WHERE SOME SUBMARINE ECHO OF MY VOICE

BLURTS KNOWLEDGE YOU CAN’T USE.

1962

ALWAYS THE SAME

SLOWLY, PROMETHEUS

BLEEDS TO LIFE

IN HIS HUGE LONELINESS.

YOU, FOR WHOM

HIS BOWELS ARE EXPOSED,

GO ABOUT YOUR AFFAIRS

DYING A LITTLE EVERY DAY

FROM THE INSIDE OUT

ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY

TILL THE LATE DECADES WHEN

WOMEN GO HYSTERICAL

AND MEN ARE DUMBLY FRIGHTENED

AND FAR AWAY, LIKE THE SEA

PROMETHEUS SINGS ON

“LIKE A BATTLE-SONG AFTER A BATTLE.”

1962

PEACE

LASHES OF WHITE LIGHT

BINDING ANOTHER HAILCLOUD—

THE WHOLE ONSET ALL OVER

BURSTING AGAINST OUR FACES,

SPUTTERING LIKE DEAD HOLLY

FIRED IN A GRATE:

AND THE BIRDS GO MAD

POTTED BY GRAPESHOT

WHILE THE SUN SHINES

IN ONE QUARTER OF HEAVEN

AND THE RAINBOW

BREAKS OUT ITS ENORMOUS FLAG—

OILY, UNNEGOTIABLE—

OVER THE SACK-DRAPED BACKS

OF THE CATTLE IN THEIR KINGDOM.

1961

THE ROOFWALKER

FOR DENISE LEVERTOV

OVER THE HALF-FINISHED HOUSES

NIGHT COMES. THE BUILDERS

STAND ON THE ROOF. IT IS

QUIET AFTER THE HAMMERS,

THE PULLEYS HANG SLACK.

GIANTS, THE ROOFWALKERS,

ON A LISTING DECK, THE WAVE

OF DARKNESS ABOUT TO BREAK

ON THEIR HEADS. THE SKY

IS A TORN SAIL WHERE FIGURES

PASS MAGNIFIED, SHADOWS

ON A BURNING DECK.

I FEEL LIKE THEM UP THERE:

EXPOSED, LARGER THAN LIFE,

AND DUE TO BREAK MY NECK.

WAS IT WORTH WHILE TO LAY—

WITH INFINITE EXERTION—

A ROOF I CAN’T LIVE UNDER?

—ALL THOSE BLUEPRINTS,

CLOSINGS OF GAPS,

MEASURINGS, CALCULATIONS?

A LIFE I DIDN’T CHOOSE

CHOSE ME: EVEN

MY TOOLS ARE THE WRONG ONES

FOR WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

I’M NAKED, IGNORANT,

A NAKED MAN FLEEING

ACROSS THE ROOFS

WHO COULD WITH A SHADE OF DIFFERENCE

BE SITTING IN THE LAMPLIGHT

AGAINST THE CREAM WALLPAPER

READING—NOT WITH INDIFFERENCE—

ABOUT A NAKED MAN

FLEEING ACROSS THE ROOFS.

1961

AT THE JEWISH NEW YEAR

FOR MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND YEARS

THIS CALM SEPTEMBER DAY

WITH YELLOW IN THE LEAF

HAS LAIN IN THE KERNEL OF TIME

WHILE THE WORLD OUTSIDE THE WALLS

HAS HAD ITS TURBULENT SAY

AND HISTORY LIKE A LONG

SNAKE HAS CRAWLED ON ITS WAY

AND IS CRAWLING ONWARD STILL.

AND WE HAVE LITTLE TO TELL

ON THIS OR ANY FEAST

EXCEPT OF THE TERRIBLE PAST.

FIVE THOUSAND YEARS ARE CAST

DOWN BEFORE THE WONDERING CHILD

WHO MUST EXPIATE THEM ALL.

SOME OF US HAVE REPLIED

IN THE BITTERNESS OF YOUTH

OR THE QUALMS OF MIDDLE-AGE:

“IF TIME IS UNSATISFIED,

AND ALL OUR FATHERS HAVE SUFFERED

CAN NEVER BE ENOUGH,

WHY, THEN, WE CHOOSE TO FORGET.

LET OUR FORGETTING BEGIN

WITH THOSE AGE-OLD ARGUMENTS

IN WHICH THEIR MINDS WERE WOUND

LIKE MUSTY PHYLACTERIES;

AND WE CHOOSE TO FORGET AS WELL

THOSE CHERISHED HISTORIES

THAT MADE OUR OLD MEN FOND,

AND ALREADY ARE STRANGE TO US.

“OR LET US, BEING TODAY

TOO RATIONAL TO CRY OUT,

OR TRAMPLE UNDERFOOT

WHAT AFTER ALL PRESERVES

A CERTAIN SAVOR YET—

THOUGH TORN UP BY THE ROOTS—

LET US MAKE OUR COMPROMISE

WITH THE TERROR AND THE GUILT

AND VIEW AS CURIOUS RELICS

ONCE FOUND IN DAILY USE

THE MYTHOLOGY, THE NAMES

THAT, HOWEVER TIME HAS CORRUPTED

THEIR ANCIENT PURITY

STILL BURN LIKE YELLOW FLAMES,

BUT THEIR FIRE IS NOT FOR US.”

AND YET, HOWEVER WE CHOOSE

TO DENY OR TO REMEMBER,

THOUGH ON THE CALENDARS

WE WAKE AND SUFFER BY,

THIS DAY IS MERELY ONE

OF THIRTY IN SEPTEMBER—

IN THE KERNEL OF THE MIND

THE NEW YEAR MUST RENEW

THIS DAY, AS FOR OUR KIND

OVER FIVE THOUSAND YEARS,

THE TASK OF BEING OURSELVES.

WHATEVER WE STRAIN TO FORGET,

OUR MEMORY MUST BE LONG.

MAY THE TASTE OF HONEY LINGER

UNDER THE BITTEREST TONGUE.

1955

MOVING IN WINTER

THEIR LIFE, COLLAPSED LIKE UNPLAYED CARDS,

IS CARRIED PIECEMEAL THROUGH THE SNOW:

HEADBOARD AND FOOTBOARD NOW, THE BED

WHERE SHE HAS LAIN DESIRING HIM

WHERE OVERHEAD HIS SLEEP WILL BUILD

ITS CANOPY TO SMOTHER HER ONCE MORE;

THEIR TABLE, BY FOUR ELBOWS WORN

EVENING AFTER EVENING WHILE THE WAX RUNS DOWN;

MIRRORS GREY WITH REFLECTING THEM,

BUREAUS COFFINING FROM THE COLD

THINGS THAT CAN SHUFFLE IN A DRAWER,

CARPETS ROLLED UP AROUND THOSE ECHOES

WHICH, SHAKEN OUT, TAKE WING AND BREED

NEW ALTERCATIONS, THE OLD SILENCES.

1957

NECESSITIES OF LIFE

PIECE BY PIECE I SEEM

TO RE-ENTER THE WORLD: I FIRST BEGAN

A SMALL, FIXED DOT, STILL SEE

THAT OLD MYSELF, A DARK-BLUE THUMBTACK

PUSHED INTO THE SCENE,

A HARD LITTLE HEAD PROTRUDING

FROM THE POINTILLIST’S BUZZ AND BLOOM.

AFTER A TIME THE DOT

BEGINS TO OOZE. CERTAIN HEATS

MELT IT.

NOW I WAS HURRIEDLY

BLURRING INTO RANGES

OF BURNT RED, BURNING GREEN,

WHOLE BIOGRAPHIES SWAM UP AND

SWALLOWED ME LIKE JONAH.

JONAH! I WAS WITTGENSTEIN,

MARY WOLLSTONECRAFT, THE SOUL

OF LOUIS JOUVET, DEAD

IN A BLOWN-UP PHOTOGRAPH.

TILL, WOLFED ALMOST TO SHREDS,

I LEARNED TO MAKE MYSELF

UNAPPETIZING. SCALY AS A DRY BULB

THROWN INTO A CELLAR

I USED MYSELF, LET NOTHING USE ME.

LIKE BEING ON A PRIVATE DOLE,

SOMETIMES MORE LIKE KNEADING BRICKS IN EGYPT.

WHAT LIFE WAS THERE, WAS MINE,

NOW AND AGAIN TO LAY

ONE HAND ON A WARM BRICK

AND TOUCH THE SUN’S GHOST

WITH ECONOMICAL JOY,

NOW AND AGAIN TO NAME

OVER THE BARE NECESSITIES.

SO MUCH FOR THOSE DAYS. SOON

PRACTICE MAY MAKE ME MIDDLING-PERFECT, I’LL

DARE INHABIT THE WORLD

TRENCHANT IN MOTION AS AN EEL, SOLID

AS A CABBAGE-HEAD. I HAVE INVITATIONS:

A CURL OF MIST STEAMS UPWARD

FROM A FIELD, VISIBLE AS MY BREATH,

HOUSES ALONG A ROAD STAND WAITING

LIKE OLD WOMEN KNITTING, BREATHLESS

TO TELL THEIR TALES.

1962

IN THE WOODS

“DIFFICULT ORDINARY HAPPINESS,”

NO ONE NOWADAYS BELIEVES IN YOU.

I SHIFT, FULL-LENGTH ON THE BLANKET,

TO FIX THE SUN PRECISELY

BEHIND THE PINE-TREE’S CREST

SO LIGHT SPREADS THROUGH THE NEEDLES

ALIVE AS WATER JUST

WHERE A SNAKE HAS SURFACED,

UNREAL AS WATER IN GREEN CRYSTAL.

BAD NEWS IS ALWAYS ARRIVING.

“WE’RE HIDERS, HIDING FROM SOMETHING BAD,”

SINGS THE LITTLE BOY.

WRITING THESE WORDS IN THE WOODS,

I FEEL LIKE A TRAITOR TO MY FRIENDS,

EVEN TO MY ENEMIES.

THE COMMON LOT’S TO DIE

A STRANGER’S DEATH AND LIE

ROUGED IN THE COFFIN, IN A DRESS

CHOSEN BY THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

PERHAPS THAT’S WHY WE NEVER

SEE CLOCKS ON PUBLIC BUILDINGS ANY MORE.

A FACT NO ARCHITECT WILL MENTION.

WE’RE HIDERS, HIDING FROM SOMETHING BAD

MOST OF THE TIME.

YET, AND OUTRAGEOUSLY, SOMETHING GOOD

FINDS US, FOUND ME THIS MORNING

LYING ON A DUSTY BLANKET

AMONG THE BURNT-OUT INDIAN PIPES

AND BURSTING-OPEN LADY’S-SLIPPERS.

MY SOUL, MY HELICOPTER, WHIRRED

DISTANTLY, BY HABIT, OVER

THE OLD POND WITH THE HALF-DROWNED BOAT

TOWARD WHICH IT ALWAYS VEERS

FOR CONSOLATION: EGO’S ARCADY:

LEAVING THE BODY STUCK

LIKE A LEAF AGAINST A SCREEN.—

HAPPINESS! HOW MANY TIMES

I’VE STRANDED ON THAT WORD,

AT THE EDGE OF THAT POND; SEEN

AS IF THROUGH TEARS, THE DRAGON-FLY—

ONLY TO FIND IT ALL

GOING DIFFERENTLY FOR ONCE

THIS TIME: MY SOUL WHEELED BACK

AND BURST INTO MY BODY.

FOUND! READY OR NOT.

IF I MOVE NOW, THE SUN

NAKED BETWEEN THE TREES

WILL MELT ME AS I LIE.

1963

THE CORPSE-PLANT

HOW DARE A SICK MAN, OR AN OBEDIENT MAN, WRITE POEMS?

—WHITMAN

A MILK-GLASS BOWL HANGING BY THREE CHAINS

FROM THE DISCOLORED CEILING

IS BEAUTIFUL TONIGHT. ON THE FLOOR, LEAVES, CRAYONS,

INNOCENT DUST FOREGATHER.

NEITHER OBEDIENT NOR SICK, I TURN MY HEAD,

FEELING THE WEIGHT OF A THICK GOLD RING

IN EITHER LOBE. I SEE THE CORPSE-PLANTS

CLUSTERED IN A HOBNAILED TUMBLER

AT MY ELBOW, WHITE AS DEATH, I’D SAY,

IF I’D EVER SEEN DEATH;

WHITER THAN LIFE

NEXT TO MY SUMMER-STAINED HAND.

IS IT IN THE SUN THAT TRUTH BEGINS?

LYING UNDER THAT BATTERING LIGHT

THE FIRST FEW HOURS OF SUMMER

I FELT SCRAPED CLEAN, WASHED DOWN

TO IGNORANCE. THE GOLD IN MY EARS,

SOUVENIR OF A SHREWD OLD CITY,

MIGHT HAVE BEEN WEARING THIN AS WIRES

FOUND IN THE BONES OF A WOMAN’S HEAD

MIRACULOUSLY KEPT IN ITS ESSENTIALS

IN SOME HOT CRADLE-TOMB OF TIME.

I FELT MY BODY SLIPPING THROUGH

THE FINGERS OF ITS MIND.

LATER, I SLID ON WET ROCKS,

THREW MY SHOES ACROSS A BROOK,

WADED ON ALGAE-FURRED STONES

TO JOIN THEM. THAT DAY I FOUND

THE CORPSE-PLANTS, GROWING LIKE

SHADOWS ON A NEGATIVE

IN THE CHILL OF FERN AND LICHEN-RUST.

THAT DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME

I GAVE THEM THEIR DEATHLY NAMES—

OR DID THEY NAME THEMSELVES?—

NOT “INDIAN PIPES” AS ONCE

WE CHILDREN KNEW THEM.

TONIGHT, I THINK OF WINTER,

WINTERS OF MIND, OF FLESH,

SICKNESS OF THE ROT-SMELL OF LEAVES

TURNED SILT-BLACK, HEAVY AS TARPAULIN,

OBEDIENCE OF THE ELEVATOR CAGE

LOWERING ITSELF, CRANK BY CRANK

INTO THE MINE-PIT,

FORCED LABOR FORCIBLY RENEWED—

BUT THE HORROR IS DIMMED:

LIKE THE NEGATIVE OF ONE

INTOLERABLE PHOTOGRAPH

IT BARELY SORTS ITSELF OUT

UNDER THE RADIANCE OF THE MILK-GLASS SHADE.

ONLY DEATH’S INSECT WHITENESS

CROOKS ITS NECK IN A TUMBLER

WHERE I PLACED ITS SIGN BY CHOICE.

1963

THE TREES

THE TREES INSIDE ARE MOVING OUT INTO THE FOREST,

THE FOREST THAT WAS EMPTY ALL THESE DAYS

WHERE NO BIRD COULD SIT

NO INSECT HIDE

NO SUN BURY ITS FEET IN SHADOW

THE FOREST THAT WAS EMPTY ALL THESE NIGHTS

WILL BE FULL OF TREES BY MORNING.

ALL NIGHT THE ROOTS WORK

TO DISENGAGE THEMSELVES FROM THE CRACKS

IN THE VERANDA FLOOR.

THE LEAVES STRAIN TOWARD THE GLASS

SMALL TWIGS STIFF WITH EXERTION

LONG-CRAMPED BOUGHS SHUFFLING UNDER THE ROOF

LIKE NEWLY DISCHARGED PATIENTS

HALF-DAZED, MOVING

TO THE CLINIC DOORS.

I SIT INSIDE, DOORS OPEN TO THE VERANDA

WRITING LONG LETTERS

IN WHICH I SCARCELY MENTION THE DEPARTURE

OF THE FOREST FROM THE HOUSE.

THE NIGHT IS FRESH, THE WHOLE MOON SHINES

IN A SKY STILL OPEN

THE SMELL OF LEAVES AND LICHEN

STILL REACHES LIKE A VOICE INTO THE ROOMS.

MY HEAD IS FULL OF WHISPERS

WHICH TOMORROW WILL BE SILENT.

LISTEN. THE GLASS IS BREAKING.

THE TREES ARE STUMBLING FORWARD

INTO THE NIGHT. WINDS RUSH TO MEET THEM.

THE MOON IS BROKEN LIKE A MIRROR,

ITS PIECES FLASH NOW IN THE CROWN

OF THE TALLEST OAK.

1963

LIKE THIS TOGETHER

FOR A.H.C.

1.

WIND ROCKS THE CAR.

WE SIT PARKED BY THE RIVER,

SILENCE BETWEEN OUR TEETH.

BIRDS SCATTER ACROSS ISLANDS

OF BROKEN ICE. ANOTHER TIME

I’D HAVE SAID “CANADA GEESE,”

KNOWING YOU LOVE THEM.

A YEAR, TEN YEARS FROM NOW

I’LL REMEMBER THIS—

THIS SITTING LIKE DRUGGED BIRDS

IN A GLASS CASE—

NOT WHY, ONLY THAT WE

WERE HERE LIKE THIS TOGETHER.

2.

THEY’RE TEARING DOWN, TEARING UP

THIS CITY, BLOCK BY BLOCK.

ROOMS CUT IN HALF

HANG LIKE FLAYED CARCASSES,

THEIR OLD ROSES IN RAGS,

FAMOUS STREETS HAVE FORGOTTEN

WHERE THEY WERE GOING. ONLY

A FACT COULD BE SO DREAMLIKE.

THEY’RE TEARING DOWN THE HOUSES

WE MET AND LIVED IN,

SOON OUR TWO BODIES WILL BE ALL

LEFT STANDING FROM THAT ERA.

3.

WE HAVE, AS THEY SAY,

CERTAIN THINGS IN COMMON.

I MEAN: A VIEW

FROM A BATHROOM WINDOW

OVER SLATE TO STIFF PIGEONS

HUDDLED EVERY MORNING; THE WAY

WATER TASTES FROM OUR TAP,

WHICH YOU MARVEL AT, LETTING

IT SPLASH INTO THE GLASS.

BECAUSE OF YOU I NOTICE

THE TASTE OF WATER,

A LUXURY I MIGHT

OTHERWISE HAVE MISSED.

4.

OUR WORDS MISUNDERSTAND US.

SOMETIMES AT NIGHT

YOU ARE MY MOTHER:

OLD DETAILED GRIEFS

TWITCH AT MY DREAMS, AND I

CRAWL AGAINST YOU, FIGHTING

FOR SHELTER, MAKING YOU

MY CAVE. SOMETIMES

YOU’RE THE WAVE OF BIRTH

THAT DROWNS ME IN MY FIRST

NIGHTMARE. I SUCK THE AIR.

MISCARRIED KNOWLEDGE TWISTS US

LIKE HOT SHEETS THROWN ASKEW.

5.

DEAD WINTER DOESN’T DIE,

IT WEARS AWAY, A PIECE OF CARRION

PICKED CLEAN AT LAST,

RAINED AWAY OR BURNT DRY.

OUR DESIRING DOES THIS,

MAKE NO MISTAKE, I’M SPEAKING

OF FACT: THROUGH MERE INDIFFERENCE

WE COULD PREVENT IT.

ONLY OUR FIERCE ATTENTION

GETS HYACINTHS OUT OF THOSE

HARD CEREBRAL LUMPS,

UNWRAPS THE WET BUDS DOWN

THE WHOLE LENGTH OF A STEM.

1963

BREAKFAST IN A
BOWLING ALLEY IN
UTICA, NEW YORK

SMUDGED EYEBALLS,

MOUTH STALE AS AIR,

I’M NEWLY DEAD, A CORPSE

SO FRESH THE GRAVE UNNERVES ME.

NOBODY HERE BUT ME

AND HERMES BEHIND THE COUNTER

DEFROSTING SANDWICH STEAKS.

PAEANS OF VOX HUMANA

SOB FROM THE WALLS. THIS LAND

IS MY LAND.… IT SOUNDS

MUMMIFIED. HAS NO SEX,

NO LIQUOR LICENSE.

I CHEW MEAT AND BREAD

THINKING OF WHEATFIELDS—

A GOLD-BEIGE CEINTURE—

AND CATTLE LIKE GHOSTS

OF THE BUFFALO, RUNNING

ACROSS PLAINS, NEARING

THE ABBATOIR. HOUSES

DREAM OLD-FASHIONEDLY

IN BACKWOODS TOWNSHIPS

WHILE THE LAND GLITTERS

WITH TEMPORARY LIFE

STUCK FAST BY CHOICE:

TRAILERS PUT OUT TAPROOTS

OF SEWAGE PIPE, SUCKERS

OF TV AERIAL—

BUT IN ONE OF THEM,

PERHAPS, A MAN

ALONE WITH HIS GIRL

FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1963

OPEN-AIR MUSEUM

AILANTHUS, GOLDENROD, SCRAPIRON, WHAT MAKES YOU FLOWER?

WHAT BURNS IN THE DUMP TODAY?

THICK FLAMES IN A GREY FIELD, TENDED

BY TWO MEN: ONE DERELICT GHOST,

ONE CLEARLY APTER AT NURSING DESTRUCTION,

TWO PRIESTS IN A GREY FIELD, TENDING THE FLAMES

OF STRIPPED-OFF ROCKWOOL, SPLIT

MATTRESSES, A CAVED-IN CHICKENHOUSE,

MAD LOU’S LAST STACK OF PAINTINGS, EACH A PERFECT BLACK LOZENGE

SEEN FROM A TRAIN, STOPPED

AS BY DESIGN, TO BRING US

FACE TO FACE WITH THE FLAG OF OUR TRUE COUNTRY:

VIOLET-YELLOW, BLACK-VIOLET,

ITS HEART SUCKED BY SLOW FIRE

O MY AMERICA

THIS THEN WAS YOUR DESIRE?

BUT YOU CANNOT BURN FAST ENOUGH:

IN THE PHOTOGRAPH THE WHITE

SKIRTS OF THE HARLEM BRIDE

ARE LASHED BY BLOWN SCRAPS, TABLOID SHEETS,

AND HER BEAUTY A SCRAP OF FLICKERING LIGHT

LICKED BY A GREATER DARKNESS

THIS THEN WAS YOUR DESIRE!

THOSE TRUCKED-OFF BAD DREAMS

OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS

CRAWL BACK IN SEARCH OF YOU, EYES

MISSING, SKINS MISSING, INTENSER IN DECAY

THE CARRIAGE THAT WHEELED THE DEFECTIVE BABY

ROLLS UP ON THREE WHEELS

AND THE BABY IS STILL INSIDE,

YOU CANNOT BURN FAST ENOUGH

BLUE SPARKS OF THE CHICORY FLOWER

FLASH FROM EMBERS OF THE DUMP

INSIDE THE ROSE-RUST CARCASS OF A SLAUGHTERED CHEVROLET

CROUCHES THE YOUNG AILANTHUS

AND THE TWO GUARDIANS GO RAKING THE SACRED FIELD, RAKING

SLOWLY, TO WHAT ENDLESS END

CRY OF TRUTH AMONG SO MANY LIES

AT YOUR HEART BURNS ON

A LANGUID FIRE

1964

TWO SONGS

1.

SEX, AS THEY HARSHLY CALL IT,

I FELL INTO THIS MORNING

AT TEN O’CLOCK, A DRIZZLING HOUR

OF TRAFFIC AND WET NEWSPAPERS.

I THOUGHT OF HIM WHO YESTERDAY

CLEARLY DIDN’T

TURN ME TO A HOT FIELD

READY FOR PLOWING,

AND LONGING FOR THAT YOUNG MAN

PIERCÉD ME TO THE ROOTS

BATHING EVERY VEIN, ETC.

ALL DAY HE APPEARS TO ME

TOUCHINGLY DESIRABLE,

A PRIZE ONE COULD WRECK ONE’S PEACE FOR.

I’D CALL IT LOVE IF LOVE

DIDN’T TAKE SO MANY YEARS

BUT LUST TOO IS A JEWEL

A SWEET FLOWER AND WHAT

PURE HAPPINESS TO KNOW

ALL OUR HIGH-TONED QUESTIONS

BREED IN A LIVELY ANIMAL.

2.

THAT “OLD LAST ACT”!

AND YET SOMETIMES

ALL SEEMS POST COITUM TRISTE

AND I A MERE BYSTANDER.

SOMEBODY ELSE IS GOING OFF,

GETTING SHOT TO THE MOON.

OR, A MOON-RACE!

SPLIT SECONDS AFTER MY OPPOSITE NUMBER

LANDS

I MAKE IT—

WE LIE FAINTING TOGETHER

AT A CRATER-EDGE

HEAVY AS MERCURY IN OUR MOONSUITS

TILL HE SPEAKS—

IN A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE

YET ONE I’VE PICKED UP

THROUGH CULTURAL EXCHANGES …

WE MURMUR THE FIRST MOONWORDS:

SPASIBO. THANKS. O.K.

1964

THE PARTING

THE OCEAN TWANGING AWAY THERE

AND THE ISLANDS LIKE SCATTERED LAUNDRY—

YOU CAN FEEL SO FREE, SO FREE,

STANDING ON THE HEADLAND

WHERE THE WILD ROSE NEVER STANDS STILL,

THE PETALS BLOWN OFF

BEFORE THEY FALL

AND THE CHICORY NODDING

BLUE, BLUE, IN THE ALL-DAY WIND.

BARBED WIRE, DEAD AT YOUR FEET,

IS A KIND OF DUNE-VINE,

THE ONLY ONE WITHOUT MOVEMENT.

EVERY KNOT IS A KNIFE

WHERE TWO STRANDS TANGLE TO RUST.

1963

NIGHT-PIECES: FOR A CHILD

THE CRIB

YOU SLEEPING I BEND TO COVER.

YOUR EYELIDS WORK. I SEE

YOUR DREAM, CLOUDY AS A NEGATIVE,

SWIMMING UNDERNEATH.

YOU BLURT A CRY. YOUR EYES

SPRING OPEN, STILL FILMED IN DREAM.

WIDER, THEY FIX ME—

—DEATH’S HEAD, SPHINX, MEDUSA?

YOU SCREAM.

TEARS LICK MY CHEEKS, MY KNEES

DROOP AT YOUR FEAR.

MOTHER I NO MORE AM,

BUT WOMAN, AND NIGHTMARE.

HER WAKING

TONIGHT I JERK ASTART IN A DARK

HOURLESS AS HIROSHIMA,

ALMOST HEARING YOU BREATHE

IN A COT THREE DOORS AWAY.

YOU STILL BREATHE, YES—

AND MY DREAM WITH ITS GIFT OF KNIVES,

ITS MURDEROUS HIDER AND SEEKER,

EBBS AWAY, RECOILS

BACK INTO THE EGG OF DREAMS,

THE VANISHING POINT OF MIND.

ALL GONE.

BUT YOU AND I—

SWADDLED IN A DUMB DARK

OLD AS SICKHEARTEDNESS,

MODERN AS PURE ANNIHILATION—

WE DRIFT IN IGNORANCE.

IF I COULD HEAR YOU NOW

MUTTER SOME GENTLE ANIMAL SOUND!

IF MILK FLOWED FROM MY BREAST AGAIN….

1964

THE STRANGER

FOND CREDOS, PLASTER ECSTASIES!

WE ARRANGE A PRISON-TEMPLE

FOR THE WEAK-LEGGED LITTLE GOD

WHO MIGHT STAMP THE WORLD TO BITS

OR PULL THE SKY IN LIKE A MUSLIN CURTAIN.

WE HANG HIS SHRINE WITH BELLS,

AEOLIAN HARPS, PAPER WINDMILLS,

LINE IT WITH BISCUITS AND SWANSDOWN.

HIS LACK OF CULTURE WE EXPECTED,

SCARCELY HIS DISDAIN HOWEVER—

THAT WILD HAUTEUR, AS IF

IT WERE WE WHO BLUNDERED.

WILDNESS WE FRET TO AVENGE!

EYE THAT HASN’T YET BLINKED

ON THE UNBLINKING GOLD ARCHWAYS

OF ITS TRANCE—THAT WE KNOW

MUST BE TRAINED AWAY:

THAT ALOOF, SELECTIVE STARE.

OTHERNESS THAT AFFRONTS US

AS CATS AND DOGS DO NOT—

ONCE THIS WAS ORIGINAL SIN

BEATEN AWAY WITH STAVES OF HOLY WRIT.

OLD SIMPLEMINDEDNESS. BUT THE PRIMAL FAULT

OF THE LITTLE GOD STILL BAFFLES.

ALL OTHER STRANGERS ARE FORGIVEN

THEIR STRANGENESS, BUT HE—

HOW SAVE THE EGGSHELL WORLD FROM HIS

REACHING HANDS, HOW SHIELD

OURSELVES FROM THE DISINTEGRATING

BLAZE OF HIS WIDE PURE EYE?

1964

AFTER DARK

I.

YOU ARE FALLING ASLEEP AND I SIT LOOKING AT YOU

OLD TREE OF LIFE

OLD MAN WHOSE DEATH I WANTED

I CAN’T STIR YOU UP NOW.

FAINTLY A PHONOGRAPH NEEDLE

WHIRS ROUND IN THE LAST GROOVE

EATING MY HEART TO DUST.

THAT TERRIBLE RECORD! HOW IT PLAYED

DOWN YEARS, WHEREVER I WAS

IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES EVEN

OVER AND OVER, I KNOW YOU BETTER

THAN YOU KNOW YOURSELFI KNOW

YOU BETTER THAN YOU KNOW

YOURSELFI KNOW

YOUUNTIL, SELF-MAIMED,

I LIMPED OFF, TORN AT THE ROOTS,

STOPPED SINGING A WHOLE YEAR,

GOT A NEW BODY, NEW BREATH,

GOT CHILDREN, CROAKED FOR WORDS,

FORGOT TO LISTEN

OR READ YOUR MENE TEKEL FADING ON THE WALL,

WOKE UP ONE MORNING

AND KNEW MYSELF YOUR DAUGHTER.

BLOOD IS A SACRED POISON.

NOW, UNASKED, YOU GIVE GROUND.

WE ONLY WANT TO STIFLE

WHAT’S STIFLING US ALREADY.

ALIVE NOW, ROOT TO CROWN, I’D GIVE

—OH,—SOMETHING—NOT TO KNOW

OUR STRUGGLES NOW ARE ENDED.

I SEEM TO HOLD YOU, CUPPED

IN MY HANDS, AND DISAPPEARING.

WHEN YOUR MEMORY FAILS—

NO MORE TO SCOURGE MY INCONSISTENCIES—

THE SASHCORDS OF THE WORLD FLY LOOSE.

A WINDOW CRASHES

SUDDENLY DOWN. I GO TO THE WOODBOX

AND TAKE A STICK OF KINDLING

TO PROP THE SASH AGAIN.

I GROW PROTECTIVE TOWARD THE WORLD.

II.

NOW LET’S AWAY FROM PRISON—

UNDERGROUND SEIZURES!

I USED TO HUDDLE IN THE GRAVE

I’D DUG FOR YOU AND BITE

MY TONGUE FOR FEAR IT WOULD BABBLE

—DARLING—

I THOUGHT THEY’D FIND ME THERE

SOMEDAY, SITTING UPRIGHT, SHRUNKEN,

MY HAIR LIKE ROOTS AND IN MY LAP

A MESS OF BROKEN POTTERY—

WASTED LIBATION—

AND YOU EMBALMED BESIDE ME.

NO, LET’S AWAY. EVEN NOW

THERE’S A WALK BETWEEN DOOMED ELMS

(WHOSE LIKE WE SHALL NOT SEE MUCH LONGER)

AND SOMETHING—GRASS AND WATER—

AN OLD DREAM-PHOTOGRAPH.

I’LL SIT WITH YOU THERE AND TEASE YOU

FOR WISDOM, IF YOU LIKE,

WAITING TILL THE BLUNT BARGE

BUMPS ALONG THE SHORE.

POPPIES BURN IN THE TWILIGHT

LIKE SMUDGE POTS.

I THINK YOU HARDLY SEE ME

BUT—THIS IS THE DREAM NOW—

YOUR FEARS BLOW OUT,

OFF, OVER THE WATER.

AT THE LAST, YOUR HAND FEELS STEADY.

1964

MOURNING PICTURE

THE PICTURE IS BY EDWIN ROMANZO ELMER, 1850–1923.

THEY HAVE CARRIED THE MAHOGANY CHAIR AND THE CANE ROCKER

OUT UNDER THE LILAC BUSH,

AND MY FATHER AND MOTHER DARKLY SIT THERE, IN BLACK CLOTHES.

OUR CLAPBOARD HOUSE STANDS FAST ON ITS HILL,

MY DOLL LIES IN HER WICKER PRAM

GAZING AT WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS.

THIS WAS OUR WORLD.

I COULD REMAKE EACH SHAFT OF GRASS

FEELING ITS RASP ON MY FINGERS,

DRAW OUT THE MAP OF EVERY LILAC LEAF

OR THE NET OF VEINS ON MY FATHER’S

GRIEF-TRANCED HAND.

OUT OF MY HEAD, HALF-BURSTING,

STILL FILLING, THE DREAM CONDENSES—

SHADOWS, CRYSTALS, CEILINGS, MEADOWS, GLOBES OF DEW.

UNDER THE DULL GREEN OF THE LILACS, OUT IN THE LIGHT

CARVING EACH SPOKE OF THE PRAM, THE TURNED PORCH-PILLARS,

UNDER HIGH EARLY-SUMMER CLOUDS,

I AM EFFIE, VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE,

REMEMBERING AND REMEMBERED.

THEY WILL MOVE FROM THE HOUSE,

GIVE THE TOYS AND THE PETS AWAY.

MUTE AND RIGID WITH LOSS MY MOTHER

WILL RIDE THE TRAIN TO BAPTIST CORNER,

THE SILK-SPOOL WILL RUN BARE.

I TELL YOU, THE THREAD THAT BOUND US LIES

FAINT AS A WEB IN THE DEW.

SHOULD I MAKE YOU, WORLD, AGAIN,

COULD I GIVE BACK THE LEAF ITS SKELETON, THE AIR

ITS EARLY-SUMMER CLOUD, THE HOUSE

ITS NOONDAY PRESENCE, SHADOWLESS,

AND LEAVE THIS OUT? I AM EFFIE, YOU WERE MY DREAM.

1965

“I AM IN DANGER—SIR—”

“HALF-CRACKED” TO HIGGINSON, LIVING,

AFTERWARD FAMOUS IN GARBLED VERSIONS,

YOUR HOARD OF DAZZLING SCRAPS A BATTLEFIELD,

NOW YOUR OLD SNOOD

MOTHBALLED AT HARVARD

AND YOU IN YOUR VARIORUM MONUMENT

EQUIVOCAL TO THE END—

WHO ARE YOU?

GARDENING THE DAY-LILY,

WIPING THE WINE-GLASS STEMS,

YOUR THOUGHT PULSED ON BEHIND

A FOREHEAD BATTERED PAPER-THIN,

YOU, WOMAN, MASCULINE

IN SINGLE-MINDEDNESS,

FOR WHOM THE WORD WAS MORE

THAN A SYMPTOM—

A CONDITION OF BEING.

TILL THE AIR BUZZING WITH SPOILED LANGUAGE

SANG IN YOUR EARS

OF PERJURY

AND IN YOUR HALF-CRACKED WAY YOU CHOSE

SILENCE FOR ENTERTAINMENT,

CHOSE TO HAVE IT OUT AT LAST

ON YOUR OWN PREMISES.

1964

HALFWAY

IN MEMORY: M.G.J.

IN THE FIELD THE AIR WRITHES, A HEAT-POCKET.

MASSES OF BIRDS REVOLVE, BLADES

OF A HARVESTER.

THE SKY IS GETTING MILKILY WHITE,

A SAC OF LIGHT IS READY TO BURST OPEN.

TIME OF HAILSTONES AND RAINBOW.

MY LIFE FLOWS NORTH. AT LAST I UNDERSTAND.

A YOUNG GIRL, THOUGHT SLEEPING, IS CERTIFIED DEAD.

A TRAY OF EXPENSIVE WAXEN FRUIT,

SHE LIES ARRANGED ON THE SPARE-ROOM COVERLID.

TO SIT BY THE FIRE IS TO BECOME ANOTHER WOMAN,

RED HAIR CHARRING TO GREY,

GREEN EYES GRAPPLING WITH THE PRINTED PAGE,

VOICE FLAILING, FLAILING, THE UNCOMPREHENDING.

MY DAYS LIE OPEN, LISTENING, GRANDMOTHER.

1965

AUTUMN SEQUENCE

1.

AN OLD SHOE, AN OLD POT, AN OLD SKIN,

AND DREAMS OF THE SUBTLY TYRANNICAL.

THIRST IN THE MORNING; WAKING INTO THE BLUE

DROUGHT OF ANOTHER OCTOBER

TO READ THE FAMILIAR MESSAGE NAILED

TO SOME BURNING BUSH OR MAPLE.

BREAKFAST UNDER THE PINES, LATE YELLOW-

JACKETS FUMBLING FOR MANNA ON THE RIM

OF THE STONE CROCK OF MARMALADE,

AND SHED PINE-NEEDLES DRIFTING

IN THE HALF-EMPTY CUP.

GENEROSITY IS DRYING OUT,

IT’S AN ACT OF WILL TO REMEMBER

MAY’S STICKY-MOUTHED BUDS

ON THE PROVOKED MAGNOLIAS.

2.

STILL, A SWEETNESS HARDLY EARNED

BY VIRTUE OR CRAFT, BELONGING

BY NO DESPERATE RIGHT TO ME

(AS THE MARMALADE TO THE WASP

WHO RISKED ALL IN A LAST EUPHORIA

OF HUNGER)

WASHES THE HORIZON. A QUIET

AFTER WEEPING, SALT STILL ON THE TONGUE

IS LIKE THIS, WHEN THE AUTUMN PLANET

LOOKS ME STRAIGHT IN THE EYE

AND STRAIGHT INTO THE MIND

PLUNGES ITS IMPERSONAL SPEAR:

FILL AND FLOW OVER, THINK

TILL YOU WEEP, THEN SLEEP

TO DRINK AGAIN.

3.

YOUR FLAG IS DRIED-BLOOD, TURKEY-COMB

FLAYED STIFF IN THE WIND,

HALF-MAST ON THE DAY OF VICTORY,

ANARCHIST PRINCE OF EVENING MARSHES!

YOUR EYE BLURS IN A WET SMOKE,

THE STUBBLE FREEZES UNDER YOUR HEEL,

THE CORNSILK MÄDCHEN ALL HAGS NOW,

THEIR GOLD TEETH DRAWN,

THE MILKWEEDS GUTTED AND RIFLED,

BUT NOT BY YOU, FOUNDERING HERO!

THE FUTURE RECONNOITERS IN DIRTY BOOTS

ALONG THE CRANBERRY-DARK HORIZON.

STARS SWIM LIKE GREASE-FLECKS

IN THAT SKY, NIGHT PULLS A LONG KNIFE.

YOUR EMPIRE DROPS TO ITS KNEES IN THE DARK.

4.

SKIN OF WET LEAVES ON ASPHALT.

CHARCOAL SLABS PITTED WITH GOLD.

THE REASON FOR CITIES COMES CLEAR.

THERE MUST BE A PLACE, THERE HAS COME A TIME—

WHERE SO MANY NERVES ARE FUSING—

FOR A PURELY MORAL LONELINESS.

BEHIND BLOODSOAKED LIGHTS OF THE AVENUES,

IN THE CRYSTAL GRIT OF FLYING SNOW,

IN THIS WATER-DROP BULGING AT THE TAPHEAD,

FORCED BY DYNAMOS THREE HUNDRED MILES

FROM THE WILD DUCK’S LANDING AND THE OTTER’S DIVE,

FOR THREE SECONDS OF QUIVERING IDENTITY.

THERE MUST BE A PLACE. BUT THE EYEBALL STIFFENS

AS NIGHT TIGHTENS AND MY HERO PASSES OUT

WITH A FILM OF STALE GOSSIP COATING HIS TONGUE.

1964

NOON

LIGHT PULSES THROUGH UNDERGROUND CHAMBERS.

I HAVE TO TELL MYSELF: MY EYES ARE NOT BLUE.

TWO DARK HOLES

FEED AT THE SKY.

IT SWIRLS THROUGH THEM, RAGING

IN AZURE SPIRALS.

NOTHING CHANGES THEM:

TWO BLACK TUBES, DRAINING OFF

A LAKE OF IRIS.

CLEAVE OPEN MY SKULL:

THE GOUTS OF BLUE

LEAP FROM THE BLACK GROTTO.

1965

NOT LIKE THAT

IT’S SO PURE IN THE CEMETERY.

THE CHILDREN LOVE TO PLAY UP HERE.

IT’S A LITTLE TOWN, A GAME OF BLOCKS,

A VILLAGE PACKED IN A BOX,

A PRE-WAR GERMAN TOY.

THE TURF IS A BEDROOM CARPET:

HEAL-ALL, STRAWBERRY FLOWER

AND HILLOCKS OF MOSS.

TO COME AND SIT HERE FOREVER,

A CUP OF TEA ON ONE’S LAP

AND ONE’S EYES CLOSED LIGHTLY, LIGHTLY,

PERFECTLY STILL

IN A NINETEENTH-CENTURY SLEEP!

IT SEEMS SO NORMAL TO DIE.

NOBODY SLEEPS HERE, CHILDREN.

THE LITTLE BEDS OF WHITE WROUGHT IRON

AND THE TALL, KIND, FACELESS NURSE

ARE SOMEWHERE ELSE, IN A HOSPITAL

OR THE DREAMS OF PRISONERS OF WAR.

THE DRAWERS OF THIS TRUNK ARE EMPTY,

NOT EVEN A SNAPSHOT

CURLS IN A CORNER.

IN PULLMANS OF CHILDHOOD WE LAY

ENTHRALLED BEHIND DARK-GREEN CURTAINS,

AND A LITTLE LAMP BURNED BLUE

ALL NIGHT, FOR US. THE DAY

WAS A DREAM TOO, EVEN THE OATMEAL

UNDER ITS SILVER LID, DREAM-CEREAL

SPOONED OUT IN FORESTS OF SPRUCE

SKIRTING THE GREEN-BLACK GORGES,

THICK WOODS OF SLEEP, HALF PRICKLE,

HALF LAKES OF FERN.

TO STAY HERE FOREVER

IS NOT LIKE THAT, NOR EVEN

SIMPLY TO LIE QUITE STILL,

THE WARM TRICKLE OF DREAM

STAINING THE THICK QUIET.

THE DRAWERS OF THIS TRUNK ARE EMPTY.

THEY ARE ALL OUT OF SLEEP UP HERE.

1965

THE KNOT

IN THE HEART OF THE QUEEN ANNE’S LACE, A KNOT OF BLOOD.

FOR YEARS I NEVER SAW IT,

YEARS OF METALLIC VISION,

SPEARS GLANCING OFF A BRIGHT EYEBALL,

SUNS OFF A SWISS LAKE.

A FOAMING MEADOW; THE MILKY WAY;

AND THERE, ALL ALONG, THE TINY DARK-RED SPIDER

SITTING IN THE WHITENESS OF THE BRIDAL WEB,

WAITING TO PLUNGE HIS CRIMSON KNIFEPOINT

INTO THE WHITE APPARENCIES.

LITTLE WONDER THE EYE, HEALING, SEES

FOR A LONG TIME THROUGH A MIST OF BLOOD.

1965

ANY HUSBAND TO ANY WIFE

“MIGHT I DIE LAST AND SHOW THEE!”

I KNOW: YOU ARE GLYCERINE,

OLD QUILLS, ROSE VELVET,

TEARSTAINS IN MIDDLEMARCH,

A STYLE OF GETTING INTO CABS, OF EATING FRUIT,

A DRAWER OF STONES, CHAINS, SEEDS, SHELLS, LITTLE MIRRORS:

DARLING, YOU WILL OUTLIVE YOURSELF, AND ME.

SOMETIMES THE SEA BACKS UP AGAINST A LASHED PIER,

GRINDING AND TWISTING,

A TURMOIL OF WRECKED STUFF

ALIVE AND DEAD. AND THE PIER STANDS GROANING

AS IF THE LAND DEPENDED ON IT.

WE SAY IT IS THE MOON THAT DRAWS THESE TIDES,

THEN GLAZES IN AFTERCALM

THE BLACK, BLURRED FACE TO SOMETHING WE CAN LOVE.

1965

SIDE BY SIDE

HO! IN THE DAWN

HOW LIGHT WE LIE

STIRRING FAINTLY AS LAUNDRY

LEFT ALL NIGHT ON THE LINES.

YOU, A LEMON-GOLD PYJAMA,

I, A TROUSSEAU-SHEET, FINE

LINEN WORN PAPER-THIN IN PLACES,

WORKED WITH THE MAIDEN MONOGRAM.

LASSITUDE DRAPES OUR FOLDS.

WE’RE SLOWLY BLEACHING

WITH THE DAYS, THE HOURS, AND THE YEARS.

WE ARE GETTING FINER THAN EVER,

TIME IS WEARING US TO SILK,

TO SHEER SPIDERWEB.

THE EYE OF THE SUN, RISING, LOOKS IN

TO ASCERTAIN HOW WE ARE COMING ON.

1965

SPRING THUNDER

1.

THUNDER IS ALL IT IS, AND YET

MY STREET BECOMES A CRACK IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE,

MY HOUSE A FRAGILE NEST OF GRASSES.

THE RADIOTELESCOPE FLINGS ITS NETS

AT RANDOM; A CHILD IS CRYING,

NOT FROM HUNGER, NOT FROM PAIN,

MORE LIKELY IMPOTENCE. THE GENERALS ARE SWELTERING

IN THE ROOM WITH A THOUSAND EYES.

RED-HOT LIGHTS FLASH OFF AND ON

INSIDE AIR-CONDITIONED SKULLS.

UNDERFOOT, A LAND-MASS

PUFFED-UP WITH BAD FAITH AND FATIGUE

GOES LUMBERING ONWARD,

OLD RAFT IN THE SWOLLEN WATERS,

UNREFORMED HUCK AND JIM

WATCHING THE TANGLED YELLOW SHORES

RUSH BY.

2.

WHATEVER YOU ARE THAT WEEPS

OVER THE BLISTERED RIVERBEDS

AND THE CRACKED SKIN OF CITIES,

YOU ARE NOT ON OUR SIDE,

EYE NEVER SEEKING OUR EYES,

SHEDDING ITS GRIEFS LIKE STARS

OVER OUR HECTIC INDIFFERENCE,

WHISPERED MONOLOGUE

SUBVERTING SPACE WITH ITS TEARS,

MOURNING THE MOURNABLE,

NAILING THE PALE-GREY WOOLLY FLOWER

BACK TO ITS LEDGE.

3.

THE POWER OF THE DINOSAUR

IS OURS, TO DIE

INFLICTING DEATH,

TRAMPLING THE NESTED GRASSES:

POWER OF DEAD GRASS

TO CATCH FIRE

POWER OF ASH

TO WHIRL OFF THE BURNT HEAP

IN THE WIND’S OWN TIME.

4.

A SOLDIER IS HERE, AN ANCIENT FIGURE,

GENERALIZED AS A BASALT MASK.

BREATHES LIKE A RABBIT, AN ESKIMO,

STRIPS TO AN OLDER AND SIMPLER THING.

NO CRIMINAL, NO HERO; MERELY A SHADOW

CAST BY THE CONFLAGRATION

THAT HERE BURNS DOWN OR THERE LEAPS HIGHER

BUT ALWAYS IN THE SHAPE OF FIRE,

ALWAYS THE METHOD OF FIRE, CASTING

AUTOMATICALLY, THESE SHADOWS.

5.

OVER HIM, OVER YOU, A GREAT ROOF IS RISING,

A GREAT WALL: NO TEMPORARY SHELTER.

DID YOU TELL YOURSELF THESE BEAMS WOULD MELT,

THESE FIERY BLOCS DISSOLVE?

DID YOU CHOOSE TO BUILD THIS THING?

HAVE YOU STEPPED BACK TO SEE WHAT IT IS?

IT IS IMMENSE; IT HAS PORCHES, CATACOMBS.

IT IS PROVISIONED LIKE THE PYRAMIDS, FOR ETERNITY.

ITS BUTTRESSES BEAT BACK THE AIR WITH IRON TENDONS.

IT IS THE FIRST FLYING CATHEDRAL,

EATING ITS PARISHES BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON.

IT IS THE REFINERY OF PURE ABSTRACTION,

A TOTAL LOGIC, RISING

OBSCURELY BETWEEN ONE MAN

AND THE OLD, AFFECTIVE CLOUDS.

1965

MOTH HOUR

SPACE MILDEWS AT OUR TOUCH.

THE LEAVES OF THE POPLAR, SLOWLY MOVING—

AREN’T THEY MOTH-WHITE, THERE IN THE MOONBEAMS?

A MILLION INSECTS DIE EVERY TWILIGHT,

NO ONE EVEN FINDS THEIR CORPSES.

DEATH, SLOWLY MOVING AMONG THE BLEACHED CLOUDS,

KNOWS US BETTER THAN WE KNOW OURSELVES.

I AM GLIDING BACKWARD AWAY FROM THOSE WHO KNEW ME

AS THE MOON GROWS THINNER AND FINALLY SHUTS ITS LANTERN.

I CAN BE REPLACED A THOUSAND TIMES,

A BOX CONTAINING DEATH.

WHEN YOU PUT OUT YOUR HAND TO TOUCH ME

YOU ARE ALREADY REACHING TOWARD AN EMPTY SPACE.

1965

FOCUS

FOR BERT DREYFUS

OBSCURITY HAS ITS TALE TO TELL.

LIKE THE FIGURE ON THE STUDIO-BED IN THE CORNER,

OUT OF RANGE, SMOKING, WATCHING AND WAITING.

SUN POURS THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT ONTO THE WORKTABLE

MAKING OF A JAR OF PENCILS, A TYPEWRITER KEYBOARD

MORE THAN THEY WERE. VERIDICAL LIGHT …

EARTH BUDGES. NOW AN EMPTY COFFEE-CUP,

A WHETSTONE, A HANDKERCHIEF, TAKE ON

THEIR SACRAMENTAL CLARITY, FIXED BY THE WAND

OF LIGHT AS THE THINKER THINKS TO FIX THEM IN THE MIND.

O SECRET IN THE CORE OF THE WHETSTONE, IN THE FIVE

PENCILS SPLAYED OUT LIKE FINGERS OF A HAND!

THE MIND’S PASSION IS ALL FOR SINGLING OUT.

OBSCURITY HAS ANOTHER TALE TO TELL.

1965

FACE TO FACE

NEVER TO BE LONELY LIKE THAT—

THE EARLY AMERICAN FIGURE ON THE BEACH

IN BLACK COAT AND KNEE-BREECHES

SCANNING THE DIDACTIC STORM IN PRIVACY,

NEVER TO HEAR THE PRAIRIE WOLVES

IN THEIR LUNAR HILARITY

CIRCLING ONE’S LITTLE ALL, ONE’S CLAIM

TO BE LAW AND PROPHETS

FOR ALL THAT LAWLESSNESS,

NEVER TO WHET THE APPETITE

WEEKS EARLY, FOR A FACE, A HAND

LONGED-FOR AND DREADED—

HOW PEOPLE USED TO MEET!

STARVED, INTENSE, THE OLD

CHRISTMAS GIFTS SAVED UP TILL SPRING,

AND THE OLD PLAIN WORDS,

AND EACH WITH HIS GOD-GIVEN SECRET,

SPELLED OUT THROUGH MONTHS OF SNOW AND SILENCE,

BURNING UNDER THE BLEACHED SCALP; BEHIND DRY LIPS

A LOADED GUN.

THE SONG OF THE FOOLISH BEES

A SMELL OF FURTHER HONEY

EMBITTERED NEARER FLOWERS,

A SMELL OF FURTHER HONEY

SIRENED US FROM OUR MEADOW.

THAT SMELL AND A SOFT HUMMING

CRYSTALLIZED IN THE AZURE,

THAT SMELL AND A SOFT HUMMING,

A WORDLESS REPETITION,

CALLED UPON US, THE RECKLESS,

TO LEAVE OUR USUAL GARDENS,

CALLED UPON US, THE RECKLESS,

TO SEEK MYSTERIOUS ROSES.

FAR FROM OUR FOLK AND KINDRED

JOYOUS WE WENT CAREERING,

FAR FROM OUR FOLK AND KINDRED

EXHUBERANTLY DRIVEN.

NO ONE CAN BY NATURE

BREAK OFF THE COURSE OF PASSION,

NO ONE CAN BY NATURE

ENDURE DEATH IN HIS BODY.

ALWAYS MORE FIERCELY YIELDING,

MORE LUCENTLY TRANSFIGURED,

ALWAYS MORE FIERCELY YIELDING

TO THAT ELUSIVE TOKEN,

WE ROSE AND STAGGERED UPWARD,

KIDNAPPED, DISEMBODIED,

WE ROSE AND VANISHED UPWARD,

DISSOLVING INTO GLITTER.

IT’S SNOWING; WE ARE DYING,

HOMEWARD, DOWNWARD WHIRLED.

IT’S SNOWING; WE ARE DYING;

IT SNOWS AMONG THE HIVES.

MY BROTHER

MY BROTHER, NOBODY KNOWS

THE END YOU SUFFERED.

OFTEN YOU LIE BESIDE ME, DIM, AND I

GROW CONFUSED, GROPE, AND STARTLE.

YOU WALKED ALONG THAT PATH THROUGH THE ELMS.

BIRDS CRIED LATE. SOMETHING WRONG

WAS FOLLOWING US BOTH. BUT YOU

WANTED TO GO ALONE THROUGH THE WASTE.

LAST NIGHT WE SLEPT AGAIN TOGETHER.

YOUR HEART JERKED NEXT TO ME. I SPOKE YOUR NAME

AND ASKED WHERE YOU WERE GOING.

YOUR ANSWER CAME:

“THE HORROR! … THERE’S NO TELLING …

SEE: THE GRASS

LIES DENSE AGAIN, THE ELMS

PRESS ROUND.”

HENDRIK DE VRIES

FEVER

LISTEN! IT’S NEVER SUNG LIKE THAT! LISTEN!

THE WALLPAPER STIRRED,

AND THE HAIRS OF THE HEAVY-FRINGED EYE.

WHAT FLEW

THROUGH THE ROOMS?

TOMORROW IT WILL BE

AS IF ALL NIGHT THE WHIPS HADN’T LASHED SO.—

SEE, THROUGH THE BLINDS,

THE SPIRITS IN THEIR COLD SHIPS!

BOUGHS GRAZE THE FRAME

OF THE WINDOW. FAR OFF, A WHISTLE

SOUNDS, ALWAYS CLEARLY, ALONG THE FIELDS.

THE BEASTS ON THE WALLS

FADE AWAY. THE LIGHT GOES OUT.

SABBATH EVENING PRIVACY AT HOME.

MIST-FOOTSTEPS, PROWLING PAST THE SHED.

AT THAT HOUR, NOT ANOTHER SOUL ABROAD;

THE BLUE FARMHOUSE A CLOSED HERMITAGE.

THERE WE LIVED TOGETHER, MAN AND MOUSE.

THROUGH COWSTALL WINDOWS AN ETERNAL FIRE

FELL RIDGED FROM GOLD LAMPS ON THE THRESHING-FLOOR,

STILLNESS OF LINSEED CAKES AND HAY IN HOUSE.

THERE MY FATHER CELEBRATED MASS:

SERVING THE COWS, PRIESTLIKE AT THEIR HEADS.

THEIR TONGUES CURLED ALONG HIS HANDS LIKE FISH.

A SHADOW, DIAGONAL TO THE RAFTERS.

WORSHIP HUNG HEAVY FROM THE LOFTBEAMS.

HIS ARTERIES BEGIN TO CALCIFY.

LIFELESSNESS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL STATION.

ADDED-UP, SUBTRACTED SUM.

BLACK NIGHT. OVER THE STARLIGHT SKIMS

GOD’S INDEX FINGER, TURNING THE PAGE.

DEATH COMES WALKING ON ALL FOURS

PAST THE ROOM, A CRYSTAL EGG,

WITH THE LAMP, THE BOOKS, THE BREAD,

WHERE YOU ARE LIVING AND LIFE-SIZE.

GERRIT ACHTERBERG

STATUE

A BODY, BLIND WITH SLEEP,

STANDS UP IN MY ARMS.

ITS HEAVINESS WEIGHS ON ME.

DEATH-DOLL.

I’M AN ETERNITY TOO LATE.

AND WHERE’S YOUR HEARTBEAT?

THE THICK NIGHT GLUES US TOGETHER,

MAKES US COMPACT WITH EACH OTHER.

“FOR GOD’S SAKE GO ON HOLDING ME—

MY KNEES ARE BROKEN,”

YOU MUMBLE AGAINST MY HEART.

IT’S AS IF I HELD UP THE EARTH.

AND SLOWLY, MOSS IS CREEPING

ALL OVER OUR TWO FIGURES.

LEO VROMAN

OUR FAMILY

MY FATHER, WHO SINCE HIS DEATH

NO LONGER SPEAKS AUDIBLY

LIES SOMETIMES, A GREAT WALRUS

FROM NIGHTFALL TO DAYBREAK

HIS MUZZLE IN MY LAP

IN THE STREET FROM HIS CHIN DOWN.

THE LIGHT OF MORNING FEEDS

THROUGH HIS HIDE, THINNED TO PARCHMENT,

AND HIS SLACKENED FEATURES DWINDLE

TO A LINE CREEPING OFF AMONG THE CHAIRS;

IF I RISE TO PEER AT HIM

HE WINCES AWAY TO A DOT

IN THE DAYTIME THERE’S NOTHING TO SEE

BUT AN EMPHATICALLY VANISHED

ABSENCE WHERE MOMENTS AGO

THE SUN TOO WAS JUST SHINING.

WHERE MY FATHER HAS STOOD

IT NOW JUST QUIVERS,

RIPPLING BY HANDFULS THROUGH

MY LITTLE DAUGHTER’S LIGHT HAIR

WHILE ON THE SUNNY GRASS

SHE SLOWLY SCAMPERS FORWARD.

HER LITTLE SNOOT IS SO OPEN

YOU COULD EASILY SPREAD IT OUT

WITH A TEASPOON OR YOUR FINGER

ON A SLICE OF FRESH WHITE BREAD

OR, IF NEED BE,

YOU COULD MOLD IT INTO A PUDDING.

HER LITTLE VOICE ITCHES LIKE A FLEECE;

IT WRIGGLES GAILY INTO MY EAR

AND CAN’T GET OUT WHEN IT LAUGHS;

WITH PLOPPING FISHFINS

IT FOLDS ITSELF STRUGGLING UP

INTO MY HEAD. WHERE IT SPENDS THE NIGHT.

AND HERE, THIS TALLER CHILD

IS TINEKE, MY WIFE.

SHE HUMS A NURSERY RHYME

TO THE HAIR ON HER THIRD BREAST,

WHICH WHIMPERS, BEING A BABY,

AND A THIRSTY BABY AT THAT.

I HAVE SUCH A GENTLE FAMILY,

IT KISSES, GOES ON EIGHT LEGS,

BUT IT HAS NO MOUSTACHE:

MY FATHER HAS VANISHED,

AND THEY TOO ARE ALL GOING TO DIE:

TOO SOFT, IF THEY TURN INTO AIR,

TO SWING A WEATHERCOCK;

IF TURNED INTO WATER, TOO SLIGHT

TO FILL A GUTTER; IF INTO LIGHT

TO MAKE ONE LIVE COCK CROW.

HOMECOMING

THE SEA, A BODY OF MYSTERIOUS CALLS

IS ALMOST MOTIONLESS.

I KNOW A BEACH, A TREE STANDS THERE

IN WHICH WOMEN ARE SINGING,

VOLUPTUOUS, LANGUID.

IN HARBORS SHIPS ARE STEAMING

FULL OF HONEY FROM THE SEA. DRIZZLE HANGS

LIKE EYELASHES OVER THE LANDSCAPE.

BEHIND THE SEADIKE, BREATHING INVISIBLY

IN THE MIST, SLEEP THE COWS.

THE HOBBLE OF A HORSE DRAGS ALONG THE FENCE,

HOLDING STILL WHERE I STAND WITH SWEET WORDS.

LISTEN, THE SEA CALLS,

CLAPS HER HANDS.

THE SHIPS RUNNING OUT IN THE WET

COME LIKE CHILDREN—ONE DRAGS

A SLED INTO THE GARDEN.

CHR. J. VAN GEEL

SLEEPWALKING

(NEXT TO DEATH.)

SLEEP, HORNS OF A SNAIL

OUT OF THE BLACK AND WHITE BED, FLOORS OF RED GLAZE,

MORNINGS IN THE CAREFUL GARDEN

ON PATHS SUITABLE RUBBISH SLOWLY BURIED

AND WITHOUT URGENCY OVERGROWN WITH GRASS

WITH IVY AND SOMETIMES A FLOWER

JUST AS WE DREAM

TO SEE UNSEEN, TO LISTEN UNATTENDED.

THE TWIGS OF THE MOON

IN INDIFFERENT WHITE,

HORNS UPRIGHT, WOOD WITH-

OUT LEAF AND SEEKING BEES

SADNESS DOWN TO THE GROUND.

LIKE SILENCE ALWAYS AND FROM AFAR

LISPS THE WATER

NEVER, BY NO ONE POSSESSED.

DEAD TREES IN GREEN LEAF.

WHAT TO DO BUT AMONG BUSHES,

WHAT TO SEE BUT UNDERBRUSH.

ON THIS SUN TIME SHARPENS ITSELF

TO BRILLIANCE.

A STONE OF UNTOUCHABLE FIRE

ON WHICH TIME BREAKS ITS TOOTH.

TIME CAUGHT NO HOUR: LOAFING NEXT TO

A BLAZE.

IN THE DARKENED TOWN THE OLD GROPED

WITH THEIR STICKS.

THE RAYS OF THE SUN ARE TIRED,

THE BEETLES ROT IN THE WOOD,

ONLY THE SEA….

IN THE EARTH OF THE DEAD

EARTH COVERS LEAF, LEAF COVERS LEAF.

HEARTBEAT OF THE WILD CREEPER,

HAMMER BETWEEN WING-LASHES,

BUTTERFLIES HAMMER AT THE SUN.

NOW YOU MUST GET TO THE INSTITUTION

WITH A MASK ON, YOUR LITTLE FEET

TARRED, AN IRON CROWN ON YOUR HEAD.

YOU AWAKE THERE A PYTHON,

A BOA CONSTRICTOR,

AFTER SEVEN-AND-TWENTY YEARS,

AFTER SIX-AND-TWENTY YEARS,

FAIR SLEEP, FAIR SLEEPERS.

YOU STRIKE THE PRINCE TWICE

A YOUTH WASTED WITH WAITING

FOR YOUR SERPENT EYES AND

YOU UNFOLD YOUR SCALY TAIL.

NOW YOU MUST GET TO THE INSTITUTION

WITH A MASK ON, YOUR LITTLE FEET

TARRED, AN IRON CROWN ON YOUR HEAD.

NIGHT BLOWS AWAY FROM THE SUN,

SKY IN FRESH WIND,

THE SEA KICKS OFF ITS SURF.

THE MOON SCORCHES, A CLOUD OF STEAM.

DRIVING WATER TORN TO SHREDS,

SUNNY TWILIGHT, FRUITLESS FIELD.

TAMED SEA, MUSCULAR

TO THE TEMPLES, STOOP WHERE NO COAST

IS, UNDER THE FAMILIAR BLOWS,

STAND WHERE YOU CANNOT STAND,

NIGHT IS EMBRACED ON THE SUN.

A SCARED HIND IN A WOOD OF ONE TREE.

WHETHER THE DEAD LIVE, HOW THEY REST OR

DECAY, LEAVES ME COLD, FOR COLD FOR GOOD AND ALL

IS DEATH.

POOR IS THE FRONTIER OF LIFE, TO DIE BLOSSOMS

AWAY OVER THE GRAVES.

EVERY EXISTENCE COMPETES IN EVERY

LOST CHANCE OF LIFE FOR DEATH.

OF ALWAYS FEWER CHANCES, ONE MOVED

AND DROVE OVER HER, NAKED STANDING BY HER CHILD

DEATH.

RESIDING IN A THUNDERSTORM,

SKY HOISTS SUN, NIGHT CUTS LIGHT.

THE WIND’S WINGS ARE AT HOME.

WHISTLE NOW OUT OF THE NIGHTS

SPARKS OF BURNT PAPER.

WHISPER FIRE IN THE DAYS

DRIED BY THE SUN, YOUR DESIRES

ARE LIGHTENED, CURLED TO ASH.

FLOWERS FOR HUNGER,

THE DARKEST, THE BLUE,

OF ASH, OF GREY GRANITE,

BLACK ICE,

ROOM WITHOUT WINDOW,

ABACUS WITHOUT BEADS,

ROOM WITHOUT A PERSON,

THE EATEN PAST

GNAWS,

THE TEETH OUT OF THE COMB,

THE FUNERAL WREATH EMPTILY DEVOURED,

A STONE.

WHATEVER I MAY CONTRIVE—

AND I CONTRIVE IT—DEATH’S

PRIVATE ROADS ARE THE COLDEST NIGHT.

THAT I SHALL NOT BE WITH HER—

NOT WITH HER—

THAT NOTHING SHALL GLIMMER

EXCEPT DANGER.

TREES OF ASH, TREES OF ICE,

THE LIGHT FROZEN.

SUMMER AND WINTER ARE

CONSTRUCTED OF ONE EMPTINESS.

THE BOUGHS OF THE WIND ARE DEAD.

MUST I DEJECTED AND CONTEMPLATING DEATH

NOW THAT ABOVE THE SEA A CLOUDLESS NIGHT

EMPTIES THE SKY, LET TREASON AND FALSE LAUGHTER

PRUDENTLY RING OUT UNTIL THE MORNING?

THE THRESHOLD OF THE HORIZON SHIFTS—

AND THINK WITH THE THINKERS OF THIS EARTH:

“LIFE IS THUS”—THEN AM I CRAZED

BECAUSE MY HEART ENCLOSES WHAT IT HELD?

MORNING HAS BROKEN AND THE SEA

IS WIDE, I GO BACK HOME TO SLEEP.

PATH, DUNE, TREES AND SHEEP

ARE ROSY FROM THE EAST, A ROSY GULL

FLIES UP UNDER THE RASH SKY.

WHAT’S SILENT SPEAKS ALOUD BURIED IN SLEEP.

TO JUDITH, TAKING LEAVE

FOR J.H.

DULL-HEADED, WITH DULL FINGERS

I PATCH ONCE MORE

THE PALE BROWN ENVELOPE

STILL SHOWING UNDER INK SCRATCHES

THE LETTERHEAD OF MIND.

A CHORUS OF OLD POSTMARKS

ECHOES ACROSS ITS FACE.

IT LOOKS SO FRAIL

TO SEND SO FAR

AND I SHOULD TEAR IT ACROSS

MINDLESSLY

AND FIND ANOTHER.

BUT I’M TIRED, CAN’T ENDURE

A SINGLE NEW MOTION

OR ROOM OR OBJECT,

SO I CLING TO THIS TOO

AS IF YOUR TALLNESS MOVING

AGAINST THE RAINLIGHT

IN AN AMSTERDAM FLAT

MIGHT BE HELD AWHILE

BY A HANDWRITTEN LABEL

OR A BATTERED ENVELOPE

FROM YOUR DESK.

ONCE SOMEWHERE ELSE

I SHAN’T TALK OF YOU

AS A SINGULAR EVENT

OR A BEAUTIFUL THING I SAW

THOUGH BOTH ARE TRUE.

I SHAN’T FALSIFY YOU

THROUGH PRAISING AND DESCRIBING

AS I SHALL OTHER

THINGS I HAVE LOVED

ALMOST AS MUCH.

THERE IN AMSTERDAM

YOU’LL BE LIVING AS I

HAVE SEEN YOU LIVE

AND AS I’VE NEVER SEEN YOU.

AND I CAN TRUST

NO PLANE TO BRING YOU

MY LIFE OUT THERE

IN TURBID AMERICA—

MY OWN LIFE, LIVED AGAINST

FACTS I KEEP THERE.

IT WASN’T LITERACY—

THE RIGHT TO READ MIND—

OR SUFFRAGE—TO VOTE

FOR THE LESSER OF TWO

EVILS—THAT WERE

THE GREAT GAINS, I SEE NOW,

WHEN I THINK OF ALL THOSE WOMEN

WHO SUFFERED RIDICULE

FOR US.

BUT THIS LITTLE PIECE OF GROUND,

JUDITH! THAT TWO WOMEN

IN LOVE TO THE NERVES’ LIMIT

WITH TWO MEN—

SHARED OUT IN PIECES

TO MEN, CHILDREN, MEMORIES

SO DIFFERENT AND SO DRAINING—

SHOULD THINK IT POSSIBLE

NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME

PERHAPS, TO LOVE EACH OTHER

NEITHER AS FELLOW-VICTIMS

NOR AS A TEMPORARY

SHADOW OF SOMETHING BETTER.

STILL SHARED-OUT AS WE ARE,

LOVERS, POETS, WARMERS

OF MEN AND CHILDREN

AGAINST OUR FLESH, NOT KNOWING

FROM DAY TO DAY

WHAT WE’LL FLING OUT ON THE WATER

OR WHAT PICK UP

THERE AT THE TIDE’S LIP,

OFTEN TIRED, AS I’M TIRED NOW

FROM SHEER DISTANCES OF SOUL

WE HAVE IN ONE DAY TO COVER—

STILL TO GET HERE

TO THIS LITTLE SPUR OR HEADLAND

AND FEEL NOW FREE ENOUGH

TO LEAVE OUR WEAPONS SOMEWHERE

ELSE—SUCH ARE THE SECRET

OUTCOMES OF REVOLUTION!

THAT TWO WOMEN CAN MEET

NO LONGER AS CRAMPED SHARERS

OF A BITTER MUTUAL SECRET

BUT AS TWO EYES IN ONE BROW

RECEIVING AT ONE MOMENT

THE RAINBOW OF THE WORLD.

1962

ROOTS

FOR M.L.

EVENINGS SEEM ENDLESS, NOW

DARK TUGS AT OUR SKY

HARDER AND EARLIER

AND MILKWEEDS SWELL TO BURSTING …

NOW IN MY TRANSATLANTIC EYE

YOU STAND ON YOUR TERRACE

A SCARF ON YOUR HEAD AND IN YOUR HANDS

DEAD STALKS OF GOLDEN-GLOW

AND NOW IT’S FOR YOU,

NOT MYSELF, I SHIVER

HEARING GLASS DOORS RATTLE

AT YOUR BACK, THE RUSTLING COUGH

OF A DRY CLEMATIS VINE

YOUR LOVE AND TOIL TRAINED UP THE WALLS

OF A RENTED HOUSE.

ALL THOSE ROOTS, MARGO!

DIDN’T YOU START EACH SLIP BETWEEN YOUR BREASTS,

EACH DRY SEED, CARRYING SOME

ACROSS FRONTIERS, KNOTTED

INTO YOUR HANDKERCHIEF,

HAVEN’T YOU SEEN YOUR TEARS

GLISTEN IN NARROW TRENCHES

WHERE ROOTED CUTTINGS GROPE FOR LIFE?

YOU, FRAILER THAN YOU LOOK,

LONG BACK, LONG STRIDE, BLOND HAIR

COILED UP OVER STRAIGHT SHOULDERS—

I HEAR IN YOUR EAR THE WIND

LASHING IN WET FROM THE NORTH SEA

SLAMMING THE DAHLIAS FLAT.

ALL YOUR WORK VIOLATED

EVERY AUTUMN, EVERY TURN OF THE WRIST

GUIDING THE TROWEL: MOCKED.

SLEET ON BROWN FIBERS,

BLACK WILT EATING YOUR HARVEST,

A CLEAN SWEEP, AND YOU THE LOSER …

OR IS THIS AFTER ALL

THE LIBERATION YOUR HANDS FEND OFF

AND YOUR EYES IMPLORE

WHEN YOU DREAM OF SUDDEN DEATH

OR OF BEGINNING ANEW,

A GIRL OF SEVENTEEN, THE WAR JUST OVER,

AND ALL THE GARDENS

TO DIG AGAIN?

1963

THE PARTING: II

WHITE MORNING FLOWS INTO THE MIRROR.

HER EYE, STILL OLD WITH SLEEP,

MEETS ITSELF LIKE A SISTER.

HOW THEY SLEPT LAST NIGHT,

THE DREAM THAT CAGED THEM BACK TO BACK,

WAS NOTHING NEW.

LAST WORDS, TEARS, MOST OFTEN

COME WRAPPED AS THE EVERYDAY

FAMILIAR FAILURE.

NOW, PULLING THE COMB SLOWLY

THROUGH HER LOOSENED HAIR

SHE TRIES TO FIND THE PARTING;

IT MUST COME OUT AFTER ALL:

HIDDEN IN ALL THAT TANGLE

THERE IS A WAY.

1963

WINTER

DEAD, DEAD, DEAD, DEAD.

A BEAST OF THE MIDDLE AGES

STUPEFIED IN ITS DEN.

THE HAIRS ON ITS BODY—A WOMAN’S—

COLD AS HAIRS ON A BULB OR TUBER.

NOTHING SO BLEAKLY LEADEN, YOU TELL ME,

AS THE HYACINTH’S DULL CONE

BEFORE IT BULKS INTO BLUENESS.

AH, BUT I’D CHOSEN TO BE

A WOMAN, NOT A BEAST OR A TUBER!

NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE STORKS WENT,

EVERYONE KNOWS THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED.

SOMETHING—THAT WOMAN—SEEMS TO HAVE

MIGRATED ALSO; IF SHE LIVES, SHE LIVES

SEA-ZONES AWAY, AND THE MEANING GROWS COLDER.

1965

ORION

FAR BACK WHEN I WENT ZIG-ZAGGING

THROUGH TAMARACK PASTURES

YOU WERE MY GENIUS, YOU

MY CAST-IRON VIKING, MY HELMED

LION-HEART KING IN PRISON.

YEARS LATER NOW YOU’RE YOUNG

MY FIERCE HALF-BROTHER, STARING

DOWN FROM THAT SIMPLIFIED WEST

YOUR BREAST OPEN, YOUR BELT DRAGGED DOWN

BY AN OLDFASHIONED THING, A SWORD

THE LAST BRAVADO YOU WON’T GIVE OVER

THOUGH IT WEIGHS YOU DOWN AS YOU STRIDE

AND THE STARS IN IT ARE DIM

AND MAYBE HAVE STOPPED BURNING.

BUT YOU BURN, AND I KNOW IT;

AS I THROW BACK MY HEAD TO TAKE YOU IN

AN OLD TRANSFUSION HAPPENS AGAIN:

DIVINE ASTRONOMY IS NOTHING TO IT.

INDOORS I BRUISE AND BLUNDER,

BREAK FAITH, LEAVE ILL ENOUGH

ALONE, A DEAD CHILD BORN IN THE DARK.

NIGHT CRACKS UP OVER THE CHIMNEY,

PIECES OF TIME, FROZEN GEODES

COME SHOWERING DOWN IN THE GRATE.

A MAN REACHES BEHIND MY EYES

AND FINDS THEM EMPTY

A WOMAN’S HEAD TURNS AWAY

FROM MY HEAD IN THE MIRROR

CHILDREN ARE DYING MY DEATH

AND EATING CRUMBS OF MY LIFE.

PITY IS NOT YOUR FORTE.

CALMLY YOU ACHE UP THERE

PINNED ALOFT IN YOUR CROW’S NEST,

MY SPEECHLESS PIRATE!

YOU TAKE IT ALL FOR GRANTED

AND WHEN I LOOK YOU BACK

IT’S WITH A STARLIKE EYE

SHOOTING ITS COLD AND EGOTISTICAL SPEAR

WHERE IT CAN DO LEAST DAMAGE.

BREATHE DEEP! NO HURT, NO PARDON

OUT HERE IN THE COLD WITH YOU

YOU WITH YOUR BACK TO THE WALL.

1965

HOLDING OUT

THE HUNTERS’ SHACK WILL DO,

ABANDONED, UNTENDED, UNMENDED

IN ITS CUL-DE-SAC OF ALDERS.

INSIDE, WHO KNOWS WHAT

HOVEL-KEEPING ESSENTIALS—

A GREY SAUCEPAN, A BROOM, A CLOCK

STOPPED AT LAST AUTUMN’S LAST HOUR—

ALL OR ANY, WHAT MATTER.

THE POINT IS, IT’S A SHELTER,

A PLACE MORE IN- THAN OUTSIDE.

FROM THAT WE COULD BEGIN.

AND THE WIND IS SURELY RISING,

SNOW IS IN THE ALDERS.

MAYBE THE STOVEPIPE IS SOUND,

MAYBE THE SMOKE WILL DO US IN

AT FIRST—NO MATTER.

LATE AFTERNOONS THE ICE

SQUEAKS UNDERFOOT LIKE MICA,

AND WHEN THE SUN DROPS RED AND MOON-

FACED BACK OF THE GUN-COLORED FIRS,

THE BEST INTENTIONS ARE NONE TOO GOOD.

THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE A GO OF IT

IN THE SMOKE WITH THE DARK OUTSIDE

AND OUR LOVE IN OUR BOOTS AT FIRST—

NO MATTER.

1965

FLESH AND BLOOD

FOR C.

A CRACKED WALK IN THE GARDEN,

WHITE VIOLETS CHOKING IN THE IVY,

THEN O THEN …

EVERYONE ELSE I’VE HAD TO TELL HOW IT WAS,

ONLY NOT YOU.

NERVE-WHITE, THE CLOUD CAME WALKING

OVER THE CRESTS OF TALLEST TREES.

DOORS SLAMMED. WE

FELL ASLEEP, HOT SUNDAYS, IN OUR SLIPS,

TWO MAD LITTLE GOLDFISH

FLUTTERING IN A DRYING POND.

NOBODY’S SEEN THE TROUBLE I’VE SEEN

BUT YOU.

OUR JOKES ARE FUNNIER FOR THAT

YOU’D SAY

AND, LORD, IT’S TRUE.

1965

IN THE EVENING

THREE HOURS CHAIN-SMOKING WORDS

AND YOU MOVE ON. WE STAND IN THE PORCH,

TWO ARCHAIC FIGURES: A WOMAN AND A MAN.

THE OLD MASTERS, THE OLD SOURCES,

HAVEN’T A CLUE WHAT WE’RE ABOUT,

SHIVERING HERE IN THE HALF-DARK ’SIXTIES.

OUR MINDS HOVER IN A FAMOUS IMPASSE

AND CLING TOGETHER. YOUR HAND

GRIPS MINE LIKE A RAILING ON AN ICY NIGHT.

THE WALL OF THE HOUSE IS BLEEDING. FIRETHORN!

THE MOON, CRACKED EVERY WHICH-WAY,

PUSHES STEADILY ON.

1966

MISSING THE POINT

THERE IT WAS, ALL ALONG,

TWISTED UP IN THAT GREEN VINE-THREAD,

IN THE SKEINS OF MARBLE,

ON THE TABLE BEHIND THEM—THOSE TWO!

WHITE-FACED AND UNDETERRED—

EVERYTHING DOUBLED: FORKS,

BROWN GLASS TUMBLERS, ECHOING PLATES,

TWO CRUMBLED PORTIONS OF BREAD.

THAT WAS THE POINT THAT WAS MISSED

WHEN THEY LEFT THE ROOM WITH ITS WAVY LIGHT

AND PALE CURTAINS BLOWING

AND GUESSED THE BANQUET WAS OVER, THE PICNIC

UNDER THE LEAVES WAS OVER,

WHEN HAGGLING FACES PUSHED IN FOR A LOOK

AND THE GINGERBREAD VILLAGE SHRIEKED OUTSIDE:

WHO’S IN THE WRONG? WHO’S IN THE WRONG?

1966

CITY

FROM THE DUTCH OF GERRIT ACHTERBERG.

MAYBE YOU SPOKE TO SOMEONE

AND ON THAT HOUR YOUR FACE

PRINTED ITSELF FOR GOOD.

WHERE IS THAT MAN? I NEED

TO FIND HIM BEFORE HE DIES

AND SEE YOU DRIFT ACROSS HIS RETINA.

YOU HAVE PLAYED WITH CHILDREN.

THEY WILL RUN UP TO ME

WHENEVER YOU

COME HOME FREE IN THEIR DREAMS.

HOUSES, REALIZED BY YOU,

SLUMBER IN THAT WEB.

STREETS SUPPOSE YOU

IN OTHER STREETS, AND CALL:

EVENING PAPERS …

STRAWBERRIES …

THE CITY HAS CHANGED HANDS;

THE PLAN YOU GAVE IT, FALLEN THROUGH.

1962

DWINGELO

FROM THE DUTCH OF GERRIT ACHTERBERG.

IN THE NEVER, STILL ARRIVING, I FIND YOU

AGAIN: BLUE ABSENCE KEEPS KNOWLEDGE ALIVE,

MAKES OF OCTOBER AN ADJUSTED LENS.

THE DAYS HAVE ALMOST NO CLOUDS LEFT.

CASSIOPEIA, THE GREAT BEAR

LET THEIR SIGNALS BURST BY NIGHT

TO RIP INTO IMPOSSIBILITY.

THE PLEIADES RAGE SILENTLY ABOUT.

TO WAIT IS THE PASSWORD; AND TO LISTEN.

IN DWINGELO YOU CAN HEAR IT WHISPER,

THE VOID IN THE RADIOTELESCOPE.

THERE TOO THE SINGING OF YOUR NERVES IS GATHERED,

BECOMING GRAPHIC ON A SHEET OF PAPER

NOT UNLIKE THIS ONE HERE.

1962

THE DEMON LOVER

FATIGUE, REGRETS. THE LIGHTS

GO OUT IN THE PARKING LOT

TWO BY TWO. SNOW BLINDNESS

SETTLES OVER THE SUBURB.

DESIRE. DESIRE. THE NEBULA

OPENS IN SPACE, UNSEEN,

YOUR HEART UTTERS ITS GREAT BEATS

IN SOLITUDE. A NEW

ERA IS COMING IN.

GAUCHE AS WE ARE, IT SEEMS

WE HAVE TO PLAY OUR PART.

A PLAID DRESS, SILK SCARF,

AND EYES THAT GO ON STINGING.

WOMAN, STAND OFF. THE AIR

GLISTENS LIKE SILK.

SHE’S GONE. IN HER PLACE STANDS

A SCHOOLGIRL, MORNING LIGHT,

THE HALF-GROWN BONES

OF INNOCENCE. IS SHE

YOUR DAUGHTER OR YOUR MUSE,

THIS TREE OF BLONDNESS

GROWN UP IN A FIELD OF THORNS?

SOMETHING PIERCING AND MARRED.

TAKE NOTE. LOOK BACK. WHEN QUICK

THE WHOLE NORTHEAST WENT BLACK

AND PRISONERS HOWLED AND CHILDREN

RAN THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH CANDLES,

WHO STOOD OFF MOTIONLESS

SIDE BY SIDE WHILE THE MOON SWAM UP

OVER THE DROWNED HOUSES?

WHO NEITHER TOUCHED NOR SPOKE?

WHOSE NAPE, WHOSE FINGER-ENDS

NERVELESSLY LIED THE HOURS AWAY?

A VOICE PRESSES AT ME.

IF I GIVE IN IT WON’T

BE LIKE THE GIRL THE BULL RODE,

ALL RUBENS FLESH AND HAPPY MOANS.

BUT TO BE WRESTLED LIKE A BOY

WITH TONGUE, HIPS, KNEES, NERVES, BRAIN …

WITH LANGUAGE?

HE DOESN’T KNOW. HE’S WATCHING

BREASTS UNDER A STRIPED BLOUSE,

HIS BULL’S HEAD DOWN.

THE OLD WINE POURS AGAIN THROUGH MY VEINS.

GOODNIGHT, THEN. ’NIGHT. AGAIN

WE TURN OUR BACKS AND WEARY

WEARY WE LET DOWN.

THINGS TAKE US HARD, NO QUESTION.

HOW DO YOU MAKE IT, ALL THE WAY

FROM HERE TO MORNING? I TOUCH

YOU, MADE OF SUCH NERVE

AND FLARE AND PRIDE AND SWALLOWED TEARS.

GO HOME. COME TO BED. THE SKIES

LOOK IN AT US, STERN.

AND THIS IS AN OLD STORY.

I DREAMED ABOUT THE WAR.

WE WERE ALL SITTING AT TABLE

IN A KITCHEN IN CHICAGO.

THE RADIO HAD JUST SCREAMED

THAT ILLINOIS WAS THE TARGET.

NO ONE FELT LIKE LEAVING,

WE SAT BY THE OPEN WINDOW

AND TALKED IN THE SUNSET.

I’LL TELL YOU THAT JOKE TOMORROW,

YOU SAID WITH YOUR SADDEST SMILE,

IF I CAN REMEMBER.

THE END IS JUST A STRAW,

A FEATHER FURLING SLOWLY DOWN,

FLOATING TO LIGHT BY CHANCE, A BREATH

ON THE LONG-LOADED SCALES.

POSTERITY TREMBLES LIKE A LEAF

AND WE GO ON MAKING HEIRS AND HEIRLOOMS.

THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO MAKE IT,

MY COEXISTENT FRIEND SAID, LEANING

BACK IN HIS CELL.

SIBERIA VASTLY HULKS

BEHIND HIM, WHICH HE DID NOT MAKE.

OH FUTILE TENDERNESS

OF TOUCH IN A WORLD LIKE THIS!

HOW MUCH LONGER, DEAR CHILD,

DO YOU THINK SEX WILL MATTER?

THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A WEDDING

THAT NEVER WAS:

TWO CREATURES SPRUNG FREE

FROM CASTIRON COVENANTS.

INSTEAD OUR HANDS AND MINDS

EROTICALLY WAVER …

LIGHTNESS IS UNAVAILING.

CATALPAS WAVE AND SPILL

THEIR DULL STRINGS ACROSS THIS MURK OF SPRING.

I ACHE, BRILLIANTLY.

ONLY WHERE THERE IS LANGUAGE IS THERE WORLD.

IN THE HARP OF MY HAIR, COMPOSE ME

A SONG. DEATH’S IN THE AIR,

WE ALL KNOW THAT. STILL, FOR AN HOUR,

I’D LIKE TO BE GAY. HOW COULD A GAY SONG GO?

WHY THAT’S YOUR SECRET, AND IT SHALL BE MINE.

WE ARE OUR WORDS, AND BLACK AND BRUISED AND BLUE.

UNDER OUR SKINS, WE’RE LAUGHING.

IN TRISTE VERITAS?

TAKE HOLD, SWEET HANDS, COME ON …

BROKEN!

WHEN YOU FALTER, ALL ELUDES.

THIS IS A SEASICK WAY,

THIS ALMOST/NEVER TOUCHING, THIS

DRAWING-OFF, THIS TO-AND-FRO.

SUBTLETY STALKS IN YOUR EYES,

YOUR TONGUE KNOWS WHAT IT KNOWS.

I WANT YOUR SECRETS—I WILL HAVE THEM OUT.

SEASICK, I DROP INTO THE SEA.

1966

JERUSALEM

IN MY DREAM, CHILDREN

ARE STONING OTHER CHILDREN

WITH BLACKENED CAROB-PODS

I DREAM MY SON IS RIDING

ON AN OLD GREY MARE

TO A HALF-DEAD WAR

ON A DEAD-GREY ROAD

THROUGH THE CACTUS AND THISTLES

AND DRIED BROOK-BEDS.

IN MY DREAM, CHILDREN

ARE SWADDLED IN SMOKE

AND THEIR UNCUT HAIR SMOLDERS

EVEN HERE, HERE

WHERE TREES HAVE NO SHADE

AND ROCKS HAVE NO SHADOW

TREES HAVE NO MEMORIES

ONLY THE STONES AND

THE HAIRS OF THE HEAD.

I DREAM HIS HAIR IS GROWING

AND HAS NEVER BEEN SHORN

FROM SLENDER TEMPLES HANGING

LIKE CURLS OF BARBED WIRE

AND HIS FIRST BEARD IS GROWING

SMOLDERING LIKE FIRE

HIS BEARD IS SMOKE AND FIRE

AND I DREAM HIM RIDING

PATIENTLY TO THE WAR.

WHAT I DREAM OF THE CITY

IS HOW HARD IT IS TO LEAVE

AND HOW USELESS TO WALK

OUTSIDE THE BLASTED WALLS

PICKING UP THE SHELLS

FROM A HALF-DEAD WAR

AND I WAKE UP IN TEARS

AND HEAR THE SIRENS SCREAMING

AND THE CAROB-TREE IS BARE.

BALFOUR STREET, JULY 1966

CHARLESTON IN THE 1860’S

DERIVED FROM THE DIARIES OF MARY BOYKIN CHESNUT.

HE SEIZED ME BY THE WAIST AND KISSED MY THROAT …

YOUR EYES, DEAR, ARE THEY GREY OR BLUE,

EYES OF AN ANGEL?

THE CARTS HAVE PASSED ALREADY WITH THEIR HEAPED

NIGHT-SOIL, WE BREATHE AGAIN …

IS THIS WHAT WAR IS? NITRATE …

BUT SMELL THE PEAR,

THE JASMINE, THE VIOLETS.

WHY DOES THIS LANDSCAPE ALWAYS SADDEN YOU?

NOW THE FRESHET IS UP ON EVERY SIDE,

THE RIVER COMES TO OUR DOORS,

LIMBS OF PRIMEVAL TREES DIP IN THE SWAMP.

SO WE FOOL ON INTO THE BLACK

CLOUD AHEAD OF US.

EVERYTHING HUMAN GLITTERS FEVER-BRIGHT—

THE THRILL OF WAKING UP

OUT OF A STAGNANT LIFE?

THERE SEEMS A SPELL UPON

YOUR LOVERS, —ALL DEAD OF WOUNDS

OR BLOWN TO PIECES … NITRATE!

I’M WRITING, BLIND WITH TEARS OF RAGE.

IN VAIN. YEARS, DEATH, DEPOPULATION, FEARS,

BONDAGE—THESE SHALL ALL BE BORNE.

NO IMAGINATION TO FORESTALL WOE.

1966

NIGHT WATCH

AND NOW, OUTSIDE, THE WALLS

OF BLACK FLINT, EYELESS.

HOW PALE IN SLEEP YOU LIE.

LOVE: MY LOVE IS JUST A BREATH

BLOWN ON THE PANE AND DISSOLVED.

EVERYTHING, EVEN YOU,

CRIES SILENTLY FOR HELP, THE WEB

OF THE SPIDER IS RIPPED WITH RAIN,

THE GEESE FLY ON INTO THE BLACK CLOUD.

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

CAN THE TOUCH OF A FINGER MEND

WHAT A FINGER’S TOUCH HAS BROKEN?

BLUE-EYED NOW, YELLOW-HAIRED,

I STAND IN MY OLD NIGHTMARE

BESIDE THE TRACK, WHILE YOU,

AND OVER AND OVER AND ALWAYS YOU

PLOD INTO THE DEATHCARS.

SOMETIMES YOU SMILE AT ME

AND I—I SMILE BACK AT YOU.

HOW SWEET THE ODOR OF THE STATION-MASTER’S ROSES!

HOW PURE, HOW POSTER-LIKE THE COLORS OF THIS DREAM.

1967

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS

FROM THE YIDDISH OF KADIA MOLODOWSKY.

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS HERE,

WHEN A BLADE OF GRASS PUSHES UP THROUGH THE SOIL

AND THE FRESH DAWN IS A GREEN PILLOW

UNDER THE SKELETON OF A DEAD HORSE.

AND ALL THE LIMBS OF A WOMAN PLEAD FOR THE ACHE OF BIRTH.

AND WOMEN COME TO LIE DOWN LIKE SICK SHEEP

BY THE WELLS—TO HEAL THEIR BODIES,

THEIR FACES BLACKENED WITH YEARLONG THIRST FOR A CHILD’S CRY.

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS HERE

WHEN LIGHTNING PIERCES THE BLACK SOIL WITH SILVER KNIVES

AND PREGNANT WOMEN APPROACH THE WHITE TABLES OF THE HOSPITAL

WITH QUIET STEPS

AND SMILE AT THE UNBORN CHILD

AND PERHAPS AT DEATH.

THERE ARE SUCH SPRINGLIKE NIGHTS HERE

WHEN A BLADE OF GRASS PUSHES UP THROUGH THE SOIL.

1968

FOR A RUSSIAN POET

1. THE WINTER DREAM

EVERYWHERE, SNOW IS FALLING. YOUR BANDAGED FOOT

DRAGS ACROSS HUGE COBBLESTONES, BELLS

HAMMER IN DISTANT SQUARES.

EVERYTHING WE STOOD AGAINST HAS CONQUERED

AND NOW WE’RE PART

OF IT ALL. LIFE’S THE MAIN THING, I HEAR YOU SAY,

BUT A FOG IS SPREADING BETWEEN THIS LANDMASS

AND THE ONE YOUR VOICE

MAPPED SO LONG FOR ME. ALL THAT’S VISIBLE

IS WALLS, ENDLESSLY YELLOW-GREY, WHERE

SO MANY RISKS WERE TAKEN, THE SHREDDED SKIES

SLOWLY LITTERING BOTH OUR CONTINENTS WITH

THE ONLY JUSTICE LEFT, BURYING

FOOTPRINTS, BELLS AND VOICES WITH ALL DELIBERATE SPEED.

1967

2. SUMMER IN THE COUNTRY

NOW, AGAIN, EVERY YEAR FOR YEARS: THE LIFE-AND-DEATH TALK,

LATE AUGUST, FOREBODINGS

UNDER THE BIRCHES, ALONG THE WATER’S EDGE

AND BETWEEN THE TYPED LINES

AND EVENINGS, TRACING A PATTERN OF ABSURD HOPES

IN BROKEN NUTSHELLS

BUT THIS YEAR WE BOTH

SIT AFTER DARK WITH THE RADIO

UNABLE TO READ, UNABLE TO WRITE

TRYING THE BLURRED EDGES OF BROADCASTS

FOR A LITTLE TRUTH, TAKING A WALK BEFORE BED

WONDERING WHAT A MAN CAN DO, ASKING THAT

AT THE VERGE OF TEARS IN A LIGHTNING-FLASH OF LONELINESS.

3. THE DEMONSTRATION

NATALYA GORBANEVSKAYA

13/3 NOVOPESCHANAYA STREET

APARTMENT 34

AT NOON WE SIT DOWN QUIETLY ON THE PARAPET

AND UNFURL OUR BANNERS

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY

THE SOUND OF POLICE WHISTLES

FROM ALL CORNERS OF RED SQUARE

WE SIT

QUIETLY AND OFFER NO RESISTANCE

IS THIS YOUR LITTLE BOY

WE WILL RELIVE THIS OVER AND OVER

THE BANNERS TORN FROM OUR HANDS

BLOOD FLOWING

A GREAT JAGGED TORN PLACE

IN THE SILENCE OF COMPLICITY

THAT MUCH AT LEAST

WE DID HERE

IN YOUR FLAT, DRINKING TEA

WAITING FOR THE POLICE

YOUR CHILDREN ASLEEP WHILE YOU WRITE

QUICKLY, THE LETTERS YOU WANT TO GET OFF

BEFORE TOMORROW

I’M A GHOST AT YOUR TABLE

TOUCHING POEMS IN A SCRIPT I CAN’T READ

WE’LL MEET EACH OTHER LATER

AUGUST 1968

NIGHT IN THE KITCHEN

THE REFRIGERATOR FALLS SILENT.

THEN OTHER THINGS ARE AUDIBLE:

THIS DULL, SHEET-METAL MIND RATTLING LIKE STAGE THUNDER.

THE THICKNESS BUDGING FORWARD IN THESE VEINS

IS SURELY SOMETHING OTHER

THAN BLOOD:

SAY, MOLTEN LAVA.

YOU WILL BECOME A BLACK LACE CLIFF FRONTING A DEADPAN SEA;

NERVES, FRIABLE AS LIGHTNING

ENDING IN BURNT PINE FORESTS.

YOU ARE BEGUN, BEGINNING, YOUR BLACK HEART DRUMMING

SLOWLY, TRIUMPHANTLY

INSIDE ITS PACIFIC CAVE.

1967

5:30 A.M.

BIRDS AND PERIODIC BLOOD.

OLD RECAPITULATIONS.

THE FOX, PANTING, FIRE-EYED,

GONE TO EARTH IN MY CHEST.

HOW BEAUTIFUL WE ARE,

HE AND I, WITH OUR AUBURN

PELTS, OUR TRAILS OF BLOOD,

OUR MIRACLE ESCAPES,

OUR WHIPLASH PANIC FLOGGING US ON

TO NEW MIRACLES!

THEY’VE SUPPLIED US WITH PILLS

FOR BLEEDING, PILLS FOR PANIC.

WASH THEM DOWN THE SINK.

THIS IS TRUTH, THEN:

DULL NEEDLE GROPING IN THE SPINAL FLUID,

WEAK ACID IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CUP,

FOREBODING, FOREBODING.

NO ONE TELLS THE TRUTH ABOUT TRUTH,

THAT IT’S WHAT THE FOX

SEES FROM HIS SCUFFLED BURROW:

DULL-JAWED, ONRUSHING

KILLER, BEING THAT

INANELY SINGLE-MINDED

WILL HAVE OUR SKINS AT LAST.

1967

THE BREAK

ALL MONTH EATING THE HEART OUT,

SMOTHERING IN A FIERCE INSOMNIA …

FIRST THE LONG, SPONGY SUMMER, DRYING

OUT BY FITS AND STARTS, TILL A MORNING

TORN OFF ANOTHER CALENDAR

WHEN THE WIND STIFFENS, CHAIRS

AND TABLES ROUSE THEMSELVES

IN A NEW, UNPLANNED LIGHT

AND A WORD FLIES LIKE A DRY LEAF DOWN THE HALL

AT THE BANG OF A DOOR.

THEN BREAK, OCTOBER, SPEAK,

NON-EXISTENT AND DAMNING CLARITY.

STARE ME DOWN, THRUST

YOUR TONGUE AGAINST MINE, BREAK

DAY, LET ME STAND UP

LIKE A TABLE OR A CHAIR

IN A COLD ROOM WITH THE SUN BEATING IN

FULL ON THE DUSTY PANES.

1967

TWO POEMS

ADAPTED FROM ANNA AKHMATOVA.

1.

THERE’S A SECRET BOUNDARY HIDDEN IN THE WAVING GRASSES:

NEITHER THE LOVER NOR THE EXPERT SENSUALIST

PASSES IT, THOUGH MOUTHS PRESS SILENTLY TOGETHER

AND THE HEART IS BURSTING.

AND FRIENDS—THEY TOO ARE HELPLESS THERE,

AND SO WITH YEARS OF FIRE AND JOY,

WHOLE HISTORIES OF FREEDOM

UNBURDENED BY SENSUAL LANGUOR.

THE CRAZY ONES PUSH ON TO THAT FRONTIER

WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND IT ARE SICK WITH GRIEF …

AND NOW YOU KNOW

WHY MY HEART DOESN’T BEAT BENEATH YOUR HAND.

2.

ON THE TERRACE, VIOLINS PLAYED

THE MOST HEARTBREAKING SONGS.

A SHARP, FRESH SMELL OF THE SEA

CAME FROM OYSTERS ON A DISH OF ICE

HE SAID, I’M A FAITHFUL FRIEND,

TOUCHING MY DRESS.

HOW FAR FROM A CARESS,

THE TOUCH OF THAT HAND!

THE WAY YOU STROKE A CAT, A BIRD,

THE LOOK YOU GIVE A SHAPELY BAREBACK RIDER.

IN HIS CALM EYES, ONLY LAUGHTER

UNDER THE LIGHT-GOLD LASHES.

AND THE VIOLINS MOURN ON

BEHIND DRIFTING SMOKE:

THANK YOUR STARS, YOU’RE AT LAST ALONE

WITH THE MAN YOU LOVE.

1966

THE KEY

THROUGH A DRAIN GRATING, SOMETHING

GLITTERS AND FALTERS,

GLITTERS AGAIN. A SCRAP OF FOIL,

A COIN, A SIGNAL, A MESSAGE

FROM THE INDISTINCT

PIERCING MY INDISTINCTNESS?

HOW LONG I HAVE GONE ROUND

AND ROUND, SPIRITLESS WITH FOREKNOWN DEFEAT,

IN SEARCH OF THAT GLITTER?

HOURS, YEARS MAYBE. THE CRY OF METAL

ON ASPHALT, ON IRON, THE SUDDEN

CHING OF A PRECIOUS LOSS,

THE CLEAR STATEMENT

OF SOMETHING MISSING. OVER AND OVER

IT STOPS ME IN MY TRACKS

LIKE A FALLING STAR, ONLY

THIS IS NOT THE UNIVERSE’S LOSS

IT IS MINE. IF I WERE ONLY COLDER,

NEARER DEATH, NEARER BIRTH, I MIGHT LET GO

WHATEVER’S SO BENT ON STAYING LOST.

WHY NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE

LOCKED, TO COLLAPSE INWARD AMONG ITS WEEDS,

THE LETTERS TO DARKEN AND FLAKE

IN THE DRAWER, THE CAR

TO GROW SKELETAL, AFLAME WITH RUST

IN THE MOONLIT LOT, AND WALK

EVER AFTER?

O GOD I AM NOT SPIRITLESS,

BUT A SPIRIT CAN BE STUNNED,

A BATTERY FELT GOING DEAD

BEFORE THE LIGHT FLICKERS,

AND I’VE COVERED THIS GROUND TOO OFTEN

WITH THIS YELLOW DISC

WITHIN WHOSE BEAM ALL’S COMMONPLACE

AND WHOSE LIMITS ARE DESCRIBED

BY THE WHOLE NIGHT.

1967

PICNIC

SUNDAY IN INWOOD PARK

THE PICNIC EATEN

THE CHICKEN BONES SCATTERED

FOR THE FOX WE’LL NEVER SEE

THE CHILDREN PLAYING IN THE CAVES

MY DEATH IS FOLDED IN MY POCKET

LIKE A NYLON RAINCOAT

WHAT KIND OF SUNLIGHT IS IT

THAT LEAVES THE ROCKS SO COLD?

1967

THE BOOK

FOR RICHARD HOWARD

YOU, HIDING THERE IN YOUR WORDS

LIKE A DISGRACE

THE CAST-OFF SON OF A FAMILY

WHOSE FACE IS WRITTEN IN THEIRS

WHO MUST NOT BE MENTIONED

WHO CALLS COLLECT THREE TIMES A YEAR

FROM OBSCURE TOWNS OUT-OF-STATE

AND WHOSE CALLS ARE NEVER ACCEPTED

YOU WHO HAD TO LEAVE ALONE

AND FORGOT YOUR SHADOW HANGING UNDER THE STAIRS

LET ME TELL YOU: I HAVE BEEN IN THE HOUSE

I HAVE SPOKEN TO ALL OF THEM

THEY WILL NOT PRONOUNCE YOUR NAME

THEY ONLY ALLUDE TO YOU

RISING AND SITTING, GOING OR COMING,

FALLING ASLEEP AND WAKING,

GIVING AWAY IN MARRIAGE OR CALLING FOR WATER

ON THEIR DEATHBEDS

THEIR FACES LOOK INTO EACH OTHER AND SEE

YOU

WHEN THEY WRITE AT NIGHT IN THEIR DIARIES THEY ARE WRITING

TO YOU

1968

ABNEGATION

THE RED FOX, THE VIXEN

DANCING IN THE HALF-LIGHT AMONG THE JUNIPERS,

WISE-LOOKING IN A SEXY WAY,

EGYPTIAN-SUPPLE IN HER SHARPNESS—

WHAT DOES SHE WANT

WITH THE DREAMS OF DEAD VIXENS,

THE APOTHEOSIS OF REYNARD,

THE LITERATURE OF FOX-HUNTING?

ONLY IN HER NERVES THE PAST

SINGS, A THRILL OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

I GO ALONG DOWN THE ROAD

TO A HOUSE NAILED TOGETHER BY SCOTTISH

COVENANTERS, INSTINCT MORTIFIED

IN A VIRGIN FOREST,

AND SHE SPRINGS TOWARD HER DEN

EVERY HAIR ON HER PELT ALIVE

WITH TIDINGS OF THE IMMACULATE PRESENT.

THEY LEFT ME A WESTERNNESS,

A BIRTHRIGHT, A REDSTAINED, RAVELLED

AFGHAN OF SKY.

SHE HAS NO ARCHIVES,

NO HEIRLOOMS, NO FUTURE

EXCEPT DEATH

AND I COULD BE MORE

HER SISTER THAN THEIRS

WHO CHOPPED THEIR WAY ACROSS THESE HILLS

—A CHOSEN PEOPLE.

LEAFLETS

 

 

WOMEN

FOR C.R.G.

MY THREE SISTERS ARE SITTING

ON ROCKS OF BLACK OBSIDIAN.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, IN THIS LIGHT, I CAN SEE WHO THEY ARE.

MY FIRST SISTER IS SEWING HER COSTUME FOR THE PROCESSION.

SHE IS GOING AS THE TRANSPARENT LADY

AND ALL HER NERVES WILL BE VISIBLE.

MY SECOND SISTER IS ALSO SEWING,

AT THE SEAM OVER HER HEART WHICH HAS NEVER HEALED ENTIRELY.

AT LAST, SHE HOPES, THIS TIGHTNESS IN HER CHEST WILL EASE.

MY THIRD SISTER IS GAZING

AT A DARK-RED CRUST SPREADING WESTWARD FAR OUT ON THE SEA.

HER STOCKINGS ARE TORN BUT SHE IS BEAUTIFUL.

1968

IMPLOSIONS

THE WORLD’S

NOT WANTON

ONLY WILD AND WAVERING

I WANTED TO CHOOSE WORDS THAT EVEN YOU

WOULD HAVE TO BE CHANGED BY

TAKE THE WORD

OF MY PULSE, LOVING AND ORDINARY

SEND OUT YOUR SIGNALS, HOIST

YOUR DARK SCRIBBLED FLAGS

BUT TAKE

MY HAND

ALL WARS ARE USELESS TO THE DEAD

MY HANDS ARE KNOTTED IN THE ROPE

AND I CANNOT SOUND THE BELL

MY HANDS ARE FROZEN TO THE SWITCH

AND I CANNOT THROW IT

THE FOOT IS IN THE WHEEL

WHEN IT’S FINISHED AND WE’RE LYING

IN A STUBBLE OF BLISTERED FLOWERS

EYES GAPING, MOUTHS STARING

DUSTED WITH CRUSHED ARTERIAL BLUES

I’LL HAVE DONE NOTHING

EVEN FOR YOU?

1968

TO FRANTZ FANON

BORN MARTINIQUE, 1925; DEAD WASHINGTON D.C., 1961.

I DON’T SEE YOUR HEAD

SUNK, LISTENINGTO THE THROATS

OF THE TORTURERS AND THE TORTURED

I DON’T SEE YOUR EYES

DEEP IN THE BLACKNESSOF YOUR SKULL

THEY LOOK OFF FROM MEINTO THE EYES

OF RATS AND HAUNTED POLICEMEN.

WHAT I SEE BEST IS THE LENGTH

OF YOUR FINGERS

PRESSING THE PENCIL

INTO THE BARRED PAGE

OF THE FRENCH CHILD’S COPYBOOK

WITH ITS CARTESIAN SQUARESITS GRILLED

TRAP OF HOLY GEOMETRY

WHERE YOUR NIGHT-SWEATS STREAMED OUT

IN LANGUAGE

AND YOUR DEATH

A BLACK STREAK ON A WHITE BED

IN L’ENFANT’S CITY WHERE

THE FEVER-BUSH SWEATS OFF

ITS THICK

PETALSYEAR AFTER YEAR

ON THE MASS GRAVE

OF REVOLT

1968

CONTINUUM

WAKING THICKHEADED BY CROW’S LIGHT

I SEE THE SUITCASE PACKED

FOR YOUR EARLY PLANE; NOTHING TO DO

BUT FOLLOW THE WRISTWATCH HANDS

ROUND TO THE HOUR. LIFE IS LIKE MONEY

—YOU SAID, FINISHING THE BRANDY FROM THE CRACKED

PLASTIC BATHROOM CUP LAST NIGHT—

NO USE EXCEPT FOR WHAT YOU CAN GET WITH IT.

YET SOMETHING WANTS US DELIVERED UP

ALIVE, WHATEVER IT IS,

THAT CAUSES ME TO EDGE THE SLATTED BLIND

SOUNDLESSLY UP, LEAVING YOU

TEN MINUTES’ MORE SLEEP, WHILE I LOOK

SHIVERING, LUCIDIFYING, DOWN

AT THAT STREET WHERE THE POOR ARE ALREADY GETTING STARTED

AND THAT POSTER STREAKING THE OPPOSITE WALL

WITH THE BLURRED FACE OF A SINGER WHOSE SONGS

MONEY CAN’T BUY NOR AIR CONTAIN

SOMEONE YET UNLOVED, WHOSE VOICE

I MAY NEVER HEAR, BUT GO ON HOPING

TO HEAR, TONIGHT, TOMORROW, SOMEDAY,

AS I GO ON HOPING TO FEEL

TEARS OF MERCY IN THE OF COURSE IMPERSONAL RAIN.

1968

ON EDGES

WHEN THE ICE STARTS TO SHIVER

ALL ACROSS THE REFLECTING BASIN

OR WATER-LILY LEAVES

DISSECT A SIMPLE SURFACE

THE WORD ‘DROWNING’ FLOWS THROUGH ME.

YOU BUILT A GLASSY FLOOR

THAT HELD ME

AS I LEANED TO FISH FOR OLD

HOOKS AND TOOTHED TIN CANS,

STEMS LASHING OUT LIKE TIES OF

SILK DRESSING-GOWNS

ARCHANGELS OF LAKE-LIGHT

GRIPPED IN MUD.

NOW YOU HAND ME A TORN LETTER.

ON MY KNEES, IN THE ASHES, I COULD NEVER

FIT THESE RIPPED-UP FLAKES TOGETHER.

IN THE TAXI I AM STILL PIECING

WHAT SYLLABLES I CAN

TRANSLATING AT TOP SPEED LIKE A THINKING MACHINE

THAT TYPES OUT ‘USELESS’ AS ‘MONSTER’

AND ‘HISTORY’ AS ‘LAMPSHADE’.

CROSSING THE BRIDGE I NEED ALL MY NERVE

TO TRUST TO THE MAN-MADE CABLES.

THE BLADES ON THAT MACHINE

COULD CUT YOU TO RIBBONS

BUT ITS FUNCTION IS HUMANE.

IS THIS ALL I CAN SAY OF THESE

DELICATE HOOKS, SCYTHE-CURVED INTENTIONS

YOU AND I HANDLE? I’D RATHER

TASTE BLOOD, YOURS OR MINE, FLOWING

FROM A SUDDEN SLASH, THAN CUT ALL DAY

WITH BLUNT SCISSORS ON DOTTED LINES

LIKE THE TEACHER TOLD.

1968

VIOLENCE

NO ONE KNOWS YET

WHAT HE IS CAPABLE OF. THUS: IF YOU

(STILL DRAWING ME, MOUTH TO MOUTH

TOWARD THE DOOR) HAD PUSHED

A GUN INTO MY HAND

WOULD MY FINGERS HAVE BURNED, OR NOT,

TO DRY ICE ON THAT METAL?

IF YOU’D SAID, LEAVING

IN A PRE-DAWN THUNDERSTORM

USE THIS WHEN THE TIME COMES

WOULD I HAVE BLURTED MY FIRST NO THAT NIGHT

OR, BACK WITHOUT YOU, BUNDLED

THE COLD BULK INTO A DRAWER

IN A COCOON OF NIGHTGOWNS

PRINTED WITH KNOTS OF HONEYSUCKLE …

STILL FOLLOWING YOU AS IF YOUR BODY

WERE A LANTERN, AN ANGEL OF RADAR,

ALONG THE UNTRUSTWORTHY PARK

OR DOWN THAT BLOCK WHERE THE COPS SHOOT TO KILL—

COULD I HAVE DREAMED A VIOLENCE

LIKE THAT OF FINDING

YOUR BURNT-OUT CIGARETTES

PLANTED AT RANDOM, CHARRED

FUSES IN A BLOWN-UP FIELD?

1968

THE OBSERVER

COMPLETELY PROTECTED ON ALL SIDES

BY VOLCANOES

A WOMAN, DARKHAIRED, IN STAINED JEANS

SLEEPS IN CENTRAL AFRICA.

IN HER DREAMS, HER NOTEBOOKS, STILL

PRIVATE AS MAIDEN DIARIES,

THE MOUNTAIN GORILLAS MOVE THROUGH THEIR LIFE TERM;

THEIR GENTLENESS SURVIVES

OBSERVATION. SIX BANDS OF THEM

INHABIT, WITH HER, THE WOODED HIGHLAND.

WHEN I LAY ME DOWN TO SLEEP

UNSHELTERED BY ANY NATURAL GUARDIANS

FROM THE PANICKY LIFE-CYCLE OF MY TRIBE

I WAKE IN THE OLD CELLBLOCK

OBSERVING THE DAILY EXECUTIONS,

REHEARSING THE LAWS

I CANNOT SUBSCRIBE TO,

ENVYING THE PALE GORILLA-SCENTED DAWN

SHE WAKES INTO, THE STREAM WHERE SHE WASHES HER HAIR,

LEAFLETS

1.

THE BIG STAR, AND THAT OTHER

LONELY ON BLACK GLASS

OVERGROWN WITH FROZEN

LESIONS, ENDLESS NIGHT

THE COAL SACK GAPING

BLACK VEINS OF ICE ON THE PANE

SPELLING A WORD:

INSOMNIA

NOT MANIC BUT ORDINARY

TO START OUT OF SLEEP

TURNING OFF AND ON

THIS SEASICK NEON

VISION, THIS

DIVISION

THE HEAD CLEARS OF SWEET SMOKE

AND POISON GAS

LIFE WITHOUT CAUTION

THE ONLY WORTH LIVING

LOVE FOR A MAN

LOVE FOR A WOMAN

LOVE FOR THE FACTS

PROTECTLESS

THAT SELF-DEFENSE BE NOT

THE ARM’S FIRST MOTION

MEMORY NOT ONLY

CARDS OF IDENTITY

THAT I CAN LIVE HALF A YEAR

AS I HAVE NEVER LIVED UP TO THIS TIME—

CHEKHOV COUGHING UP BLOOD ALMOST DAILY

THE STEAMER EDGING IN TOWARD THE PENAL COLONY

CHAINED MEN DOZING ON DECK

FIVE FOREST FIRES LIGHTING THE ISLAND

LIFELONG THAT GLARE, WAITING.

2.

YOUR FACE

STRETCHED LIKE A MASK

BEGINS TO TEAR

AS YOU SPEAK OF CHE GUEVARA

BOLIVIA, NANTERRE

I’M TOO YOUNG TO BE YOUR MOTHER

YOU’RE TOO YOUNG TO BE MY BROTHER

YOUR TEARS ARE NOT POLITICAL

THEY ARE REAL WATER, BURNING

AS THE TEARS OF TELEMACHUS

BURNED

OVER SPANISH HARLEM THE MOON

SWELLS UP, A FIRE BALLOON

FIRE GNAWING THE EDGE

OF THIS CRUSHED-UP NEWSPAPER

NOW

THE BODIES COME WHIRLING

COAL-BLACK, ASH-WHITE

OUT OF TORN WINDOWS

AND THE DEATH COLUMNS BLACKEN

WHISPERING

WHO’D CHOOSE THIS LIFE?

WE’RE FIGHTING FOR A SLASH OF RECOGNITION,

A PIERCING TO THE PIERCED HEART.

TELL ME WHAT YOU ARE GOING THROUGH—

BUT THE ATTENTION FLICKERS

AND WILL FLICKER

A MATCHFLAME IN POISON AIR

A THREAD, A HAIR OF LIGHT

SUM OF ALL ANSWER

TO THE KNOW THAT I EXIST! OF ALL EXISTING THINGS.

3.

IF, SAYS THE DAHOMEYAN DEVIL,

SOMEONE HAS COURAGE TO ENTER THE FIRE

THE YOUNG MAN WILL BE RESTORED TO LIFE.

IF, THE GIRL WHISPERS,

I DO NOT GO INTO THE FIRE

I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH MY SOUL.

(HER FACE CALM AND DARK AS AMBER

UNDER THE DYED BUTTERFLY TURBAN

HER BACK SCARIFIED IN OSTRICH-SKIN PATTERNS.)

4.

CRUSADERS’ WIND GLINTING

OFF LINKED SCALES OF SEA

RIPPING THE GHOSTFLAGS

GALLOPING AT THE FORTRESS

ACRE, BLOODCAKED, LIONHEARTED

RAW VOMIT CURDLING IN THE SUN

GRAY WALKERS WALKING

STRAYING WITH A CURBED INTENTNESS

IN AND OUT THE INCLOSURES

THE GALLOWS, THE PHOTOGRAPHS

OF DEAD JEWISH TERRORISTS, AGED 15

THEIR FADING FACES WIDE-EYED

AND OUT IN THE CRUSADING SUNLIGHT

GRAY STRAYERS STILL STRAYING

DUSTY PATHS

THE MAD WHO LIVE IN THE DRIED-UP MOAT

OF THE WAR MUSEUM

WHAT ARE WE COMING TO

WHAT WANTS THESE THINGS OF US

WHO WANTS THEM

5.

THE STRAIN OF BEING BORN

OVER AND OVER HAS TORN YOUR SMILE INTO PIECES

OFTEN I HAVE SEEN IT BROKEN

AND THEN RE-MEMBERED

AND WONDERED HOW A BEAUTY

SO ANARCH, SO UNGELDED

WILL BE CARED FOR IN THIS WORLD.

I WANT TO HAND YOU THIS

LEAFLET STREAMING WITH RAIN OR TEARS

BUT THE WORDS COMING CLEAR

SOMETHING YOU MIGHT FIND CRUSHED INTO YOUR HAND

AFTER PASSING A BARRICADE

AND STUFF IN YOUR RAINCOAT POCKET.

I WANT THIS TO REACH YOU

WHO TOLD ME ONCE THAT POETRY IS NOTHING SACRED

NO MORE SACRED THAT IS

THAN OTHER THINGS IN YOUR LIFE—

TO ANSWER YES, IF LIFE IS UNCORRUPTED

NO BETTER POETRY IS WANTED.

I WANT THIS TO BE YOURS

IN THE SENSE THAT IF YOU FIND AND READ IT

IT WILL BE THERE IN YOU ALREADY

AND THE LEAFLET THEN MERELY SOMETHING

TO LEAVE BEHIND, A LITTLE LEAF

IN THE DRAWER OF A SUBLET ROOM.

WHAT ELSE DOES IT COME DOWN TO

BUT HANDING ON SCRAPS OF PAPER

LITTLE FIGURINES OR PHIALS

NO STRONGER THAN THE DRY CLAY THEY ARE BAKED IN

YET MORE THAN DRY CLAY OR PAPER

BECAUSE THE IMAGINATION CROUCHES IN THEM.

IF WE NEEDED FIRE TO REMIND US

THAT ALL TRUE IMAGES

WERE SCOOPED OUT OF THE MUD

WHERE OUR BODIES CURSE AND FLOUNDER

THEN PERHAPS THAT FIRE IS COMING

TO SPONGE AWAY THE SCRIBES AND TIME-SERVERS

AND MUCH THAT YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED WILL BE LOST AS WELL

BEFORE YOU COULD HANDLE IT AND KNOW IT

JUST AS WE ALMOST MISS EACH OTHER

IN THE ILL CLOUD OF MISTRUST, WHO MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED

HANDS QUICKLY, SHARED FOOD OR GIVEN BLOOD

FOR EACH OTHER. I AM THINKING HOW WE CAN USE WHAT WE HAVE

TO INVENT WHAT WE NEED.

WINTER–SPRING 1968

THE RAFTS

FOR DAVID, MICHAEL AND DAVID

DOWN THE RIVER, ON RAFTS YOU CAME

FLOATING. THE THREE OF YOU

AND OTHERS I CAN’T REMEMBER.

STUCK TO YOUR SLEEVES, TWISTS OF

BLURRED RED RAG, OLD BANDAGES, RIBBONS

OF HONOR.YOUR HANDS DRAGGED ME

ABOARD.

THEN I SPRAWLED

FULL LENGTH ON THE LASHED POLES

LAUGHING, DRENCHED, IN RAGS.

THE RIVER’S RISING!

THEY YELLED ON SHORE

THRU MEGAPHONES.

CAN’T YOU SEE

THAT WATER’S MAD, THOSE RAFTS

ARE CHILDREN’S TOYS, THAT CROWD

IS HEADING NOWHERE?

MY LIPS

TASTED YOUR LIPS AND FOREHEADS

SALTY WITH SWEAT,

THEN WE WERE LAUGHING, HOLDING OFF

THE SCOURGE OF DEAD BRANCHES

OVERHANGING FROM SHORE AS YOUR

HOMEMADE INVENTIONS

DANCED

ALONG

GHAZALS (HOMAGE

7/12/68

FOR SHEILA ROTNER

THE CLOUDS ARE ELECTRIC IN THIS UNIVERSITY.

THE LOVERS ASTRIDE THE TRACTOR BURN FISSURES THROUGH THE HAY.

WHEN I LOOK AT THAT WALL I SHALL THINK OF YOU

AND OF WHAT YOU DID NOT PAINT THERE.

ONLY THE TRUTH MAKES THE PAIN OF LIFTING A HAND WORTHWHILE:

THE PRISM STAGGERING UNDER THE BLOWS OF THE RAGA.

THE VANISHING-POINT IS THE POINT WHERE HE APPEARS.

TWO PARALLEL TRACKS CONVERGE, YET THERE HAS BEEN NO WRECK.

TO MUTILATE PRIVACY WITH A SINGLE FOOLISH SYLLABLE

IS TO THROW AWAY THE SEARCH FOR THE ONE NECESSARY WORD.

WHEN YOU READ THESE LINES, THINK OF ME

AND OF WHAT I HAVE NOT WRITTEN HERE.

7/13/68

THE ONES WHO CAMPED ON THE SLOPES, BELOW THE BARE SUMMIT,

SAW DIFFERENTLY FROM US, WHO BREATHED THIN AIR AND KEPT WALKING.

SLEEPING BACK-TO-BACK, MAN AND WOMAN, WE WERE MORE CONSCIOUS

THAN EITHER OF US AWAKE AND ALONE IN THE WORLD.

THESE WORDS ARE VAPOR-TRAILS OF A PLANE THAT HAS VANISHED;

BY THE TIME I WRITE THEM OUT, THEY ARE WHISPERING SOMETHING ELSE.

DO WE STILL HAVE TO FEEL JEALOUS OF OUR CREATIONS?

ONCE THEY MIGHT HAVE OUTLIVED US; IN THIS WORLD, WE’LL DIE TOGETHER.

DON’T LOOK FOR ME IN THE ROOM I HAVE LEFT;

THE PHOTOGRAPH SHOWS JUST A WHITE ROCKING-CHAIR, STILL ROCKING.

7/14/68: I

IN CENTRAL PARK WE TALKED OF OUR OWN COWARDICE.

HOW MANY TIMES A DAY, IN THIS CITY, ARE THOSE WORDS SPOKEN?

THE TEARS OF THE UNIVERSE AREN’T ALL STARS, DANTON;

SOME ARE SATELLITES OF BRUSHED ALUMINUM AND STAINLESS STEEL.

HE, WHO WAS TEMPORARY, HAS JOINED ETERNITY;

HE HAS DESERTED US, GONE OVER TO THE OTHER SIDE.

IN THE THEATRE OF THE DUST NO ACTOR BECOMES FAMOUS.

IN THE LAST SCENE THEY ALL ARE BLOWN AWAY LIKE DUST.

“IT MAY BE IF I HAD KNOWN THEM I WOULD HAVE LOVED THEM.”

YOU WERE AMERICAN, WHITMAN, AND THOSE WORDS ARE YOURS.

7/14/68: II

DID YOU THINK I WAS TALKING ABOUT MY LIFE?

I WAS TRYING TO DRIVE A TRADITION UP AGAINST THE WALL.

THE FIELD THEY BURNED OVER IS GREENER THAN ALL THE REST.

YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT, HE SAID, THE SPARKS CAN TRAVEL THE ROOTS.

SHOT BACK INTO THIS EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE

OUR CHILDREN’S CHILDREN MAY PHOTOGRAPH THESE STONES.

IN THE RED WASH OF THE DARKROOM, I SEE MYSELF CLEARLY;

WHEN THE PRINT IS DEVELOPED AND HANDED ABOUT, THE FACE IS

NOTHING TO ME.

FOR US THE WORK UNDOES ITSELF OVER AND OVER:

THE GRASS GROWS BACK, THE DUST COLLECTS, THE SCAR BREAKS OPEN.

7/16/68: I

BLACKED-OUT ON A WAGON, PART OF MY LIFE CUT OUT FOREVER—

FIVE GREEN HOURS AND FORTY VIOLET MINUTES.

A COLD SPRING SLOWED OUR LILACS, TILL A SURF BROKE

VIOLET/WHITE, TENDER AND SENSUAL, MISREAD IT IF YOU DARE.

I TELL YOU, TRUTH IS, AT THE MOMENT, HERE

BURNING OUTWARD THROUGH OUR SKINS.

ETERNITY STREAMS THROUGH MY BODY:

TOUCH IT WITH YOUR HAND AND SEE.

TILL THE WALLS OF THE TUNNEL CAVE IN

AND THE BLACK RIVER WALKS ON OUR FACES.

7/16/68: II

WHEN THEY MOW THE FIELDS, I SEE THE WORLD REFORMED

AS IF BY SNOW, OR FIRE, OR PHYSICAL DESIRE.

FIRST SNOW. DEATH OF THE CITY. GHOSTS IN THE AIR.

YOUR SHADE AMONG THE SHADOWS, INTERVIEWING THE MIST.

THE MAIL CAME EVERY DAY, BUT LETTERS WERE MISSING;

BY THIS I KNEW THINGS WERE NOT WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE.

THE TREES IN THE LONG PARK BLURRING BACK

INTO OLMSTED’S ORIGINAL DREAM-WORK.

THE IMPARTIAL SCHOLAR WRITES ME FROM UNDER HOUSE ARREST.

I HOPE YOU ARE ROTTING IN HELL, MONTAIGNE YOU BASTARD.

7/17/68

ARMITAGE OF SCRAPIRON FOR THE RADIATIONS OF A MOON.

FLOWER CAST IN METAL, PICASSO-WOMAN, SISTER.

TWO HESITANT LUNA MOTHS REGARD EACH OTHER

WITH THE SPOTS ON THEIR WINGS: FASCINATED.

TO RESIGN YOURSELF—WHAT AN ACT OF BETRAYAL!

—TO THROW A RUNAWAY SPIRIT BACK TO THE DOGS.

WHEN THE EBB-TIDE PULLS HARD ENOUGH, WE ARE ALL STARFISH.

THE MOON HAS HER WAY WITH US, MY COMPANION IN CRIME.

AT THE AQUARIUM THAT DAY, BETWEEN THE WHITE WHALE’S LONELINESS

AND THE GROUPERS’ MASS PROMISCUITIES, ONLY OURSELVES.

7/23/68

WHEN YOUR SPERM ENTERS ME, IT IS ALTERED;

WHEN MY THOUGHT ABSORBS YOURS, A WORLD BEGINS.

IF THE MIND OF THE TEACHER IS NOT IN LOVE WITH THE MIND OF THE STUDENT,

HE IS SIMPLY PRACTICING RAPE, AND DESERVES AT BEST OUR PITY.

TO LIVE OUTSIDE THE LAW! OR, BARELY WITHIN IT,

A TWIG ON BOILING WATERS, ENCLOSED INSIDE A BUBBLE

OUR WORDS ARE JAMMED IN AN ELECTRONIC JUNGLE;

SOMETIMES, THOUGH, THEY RISE AND WHEEL CROAKING ABOVE THE TREETOPS.

AN OPEN WINDOW; THICK SUMMER NIGHT; ELECTRIC FENCES TRILLING.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE DEATH-CAMPS, VIVALDI?

7/24/68: I

THE SAPLING SPRINGS, THE MILKWEED BLOOMS: OBSOLETE NATURE.

IN THE WOODS I HAVE A VISION OF ASPHALT, BLINDLY LINGERING.

I HARDLY KNOW THE NAMES OF THE WEEDS I LOVE.

I HAVE FORGOTTEN THE NAMES OF SO MANY FLOWERS.

I CAN’T LIVE AT THE HEMS OF THAT TRADITION—

WILL I LAST TO TRY THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT?

KILLING IS DIFFERENT NOW: NO FINGERS ROUND THE THROAT.

NO ONE FEELS THE WETNESS OF THE BLOOD ON HIS HANDS.

WHEN WE FUCK, THERE TOO ARE WE REMOTER

THAN THE FUCKING BODIES OF LOVERS USED TO BE?

HOW MANY MEN HAVE TOUCHED ME WITH THEIR EYES

MORE HOTLY THAN THEY LATER TOUCHED ME WITH THEIR LIPS.

7/24/68: II

THE FRIEND I CAN TRUST IS THE ONE WHO WILL LET ME HAVE MY DEATH.

THE REST ARE ACTORS WHO WANT ME TO STAY AND FURTHER THE PLOT.

AT THE DRIVE-IN MOVIE, ABOVE THE PANAVISION,

BEYOND THE PROJECTOR BEAMS, YOU PROJECT YOURSELF, GREAT STAR.

THE EYE THAT USED TO WATCH US IS DEAD, BUT OPEN.

SOMETIMES I STILL HAVE A SENSE OF BEING FOLLOWED.

HOW LONG WILL WE BE WAITING FOR THE POLICE?

HOW LONG MUST I WONDER WHICH OF MY FRIENDS WOULD HIDE ME?

DRIVING AT NIGHT I FEEL THE MILKY WAY

STREAMING ABOVE ME LIKE THE GRAPH OF A CRY.

7/26/68: I

LAST NIGHT YOU WROTE ON THE WALL: REVOLUTION IS POETRY.

TODAY YOU NEEDN’T WRITE; THE WALL HAS TUMBLED DOWN.

WE WERE TAUGHT TO RESPECT THE APPEARANCE BEHIND THE REALITY.

OUR SENSES WERE OUT ON PAROLE, UNDER SURVEILLANCE.

A PAIR OF EYES IMPRISONED FOR YEARS INSIDE MY SKULL

IS BURNING ITS WAY OUTWARD, THE HEADACHES ARE TERRIBLE.

I’M WALKING THROUGH A RUBBLE OF BROKEN SCULPTURE, STUMBLING

HERE ON THE SPINE OF A FRIEND, THERE ON THE HAND OF A BROTHER.

ALL THOSE JOININGS! AND YET WE FOUGHT SO HARD TO BE UNIQUE.

NEITHER ALONE, NOR IN ANYONE’S ARMS, WILL WE END UP SLEEPING.

7/26/68: II

A DEAD MOSQUITO, FLATTENED AGAINST A DOOR;

HIS IMAGE COULD SURVIVE OUR COMINGS AND OUR GOINGS.

LEROI! ELDRIDGE! LISTEN TO US, WE ARE GHOSTS

CONDEMNED TO HAUNT THE CITIES WHERE YOU WANT TO BE AT HOME.

THE WHITE CHILDREN TURN BLACK ON THE NEGATIVE.

THE SUMMER CLOUDS BLACKEN INSIDE THE CAMERA-SKULL.

EVERY MISTAKE THAT CAN BE MADE, WE ARE PREPARED TO MAKE;

ANYTHING LESS WOULD FALL SHORT OF THE REALITY WE’RE DREAMING.

SOMEONE HAS ALWAYS BEEN DESPERATE, NOW IT’S OUR TURN—

WE WHO WERE FREE TO WEEP FOR OTHELLO AND LAUGH AT CALIBAN.

I HAVE LEARNED TO SMELL A CONSERVATEUR A MILE AWAY:

THEY CARRY ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUES OF ALL THAT THERE IS TO LOSE.

7/26/68: III

SO MANY MINDS IN SEARCH OF BODIES

GROPING THEIR WAY AMONG ARTIFICIAL LIMBS.

OF LATE THEY WRITE ME HOW THEY ARE GETTING ON:

DESERTION, DESERTION, IS THE STORY OF THOSE PAGES.

A CHEWED-UP NAIL, THE PAST, SPLITTING YET GROWING,

THE SAME AND NOT THE SAME; A NERVOUS HABIT NEVER SHAKEN.

THOSE STAYS OF TOOLED WHALEBONE IN THE SALEM MUSEUM—

EROTIC SCRIMSHAW, PRACTICAL EVEN IN LUST.

WHOEVER THOUGHT OF INSERTING A SHIP IN A BOTTLE?

LONG WEEKS WITHOUT WOMEN DO THIS TO A MAN.

8/1/68

THE ORDER OF THE SMALL TOWN ON THE RIVERBANK,

FOREVER AT WAR WITH THE ORDER OF THE DARK AND STARLIT SOUL.

WERE YOU FREE THEN ALL ALONG, JIM, FREE AT LAST,

OF EVERYTHING BUT THE WHITE BOY’S FANTASIES?

WE PLEADED GUILTY TILL WE SAW WHAT RECTITUDE WAS LIKE:

ITS WASHED HANDS, AND DEAD NERVE, AND SCLEROTIC EYE.

I LONG AGO STOPPED DREAMING OF PURE JUSTICE, YOUR HONOR—

MY CRIME WAS TO BELIEVE WE COULD MAKE CRUELTY OBSOLETE.

THE BODY HAS BEEN EXHUMED FROM THE BURNT-OUT BUNKER;

THE TEETH COUNTED, THE CONTENTS OF THE STOMACH TOLD OVER.

AND YOU, CUSTER THE SQUAW-KILLER, HERO OF PRIMITIVE SCHOOLROOMS—

WHERE ARE YOU BURIED, WHAT IS THE CONDITION OF YOUR BONES?

8/4/68

FOR AIJAZ AHMAD

IF THESE ARE LETTERS, THEY WILL HAVE TO BE MISREAD.

IF SCRIBBLINGS ON A WALL, THEY MUST TANGLE WITH ALL THE OTHERS.

FUCK REDSBLACK POWERANGEL LOVES ROSITA

—AND A TRANSISTOR RADIO ANSWERS IN SPANISH: NIGHT MUST FALL.

PRISONERS, SOLDIERS, CROUCHING AS ALWAYS, WRITING,

EXPLAINING THE UNFORGIVABLE TO A WIFE, A MOTHER, A LOVER.

THOSE FACES ARE BLURRED AND SOME HAVE TURNED AWAY

TO WHICH I USED TO ADDRESS MYSELF SO HOTLY.

HOW IS IT, GHALIB, THAT YOUR GRIEF, RESURRECTED IN PIECES,

HAS FOUND ITS WAY TO THIS ROOM FROM YOUR DARK HOUSE IN DELHI?

WHEN THEY READ THIS POEM OF MINE, THEY ARE TRANSLATORS.

EVERY EXISTENCE SPEAKS A LANGUAGE OF ITS OWN.

8/8/68: I

FROM HERE ON, ALL OF US WILL BE LIVING

LIKE GALILEO TURNING HIS FIRST TUBE AT THE STARS.

OBEY THE LITTLE LAWS AND BREAK THE GREAT ONES

IS THE PREAMBLE TO THEIR CONSTITUTION.

EVEN TO HOPE IS TO LEAP INTO THE UNKNOWN,

UNDER THE MOCKING EYES OF THE WAY THINGS ARE.

THERE’S A WAR ON EARTH, AND IN THE SKULL, AND IN THE GLASSY SPACES,

BETWEEN THE EXISTING AND THE NON-EXISTING.

I NEED TO LIVE EACH DAY THROUGH, HAVE THEM AND KNOW THEM ALL,

THOUGH I CAN SEE FROM HERE WHERE I’LL BE STANDING AT THE END.

8/8/68: II

FOR A.H.C.

A PIECE OF THREAD RIPPED-OUT FROM A FIERCE DESIGN,

SOME WEAVING FIGURED AS MAGIC AGAINST OPPRESSION.

I’M SPEAKING TO YOU AS A WOMAN TO A MAN:

WHEN YOUR BLOOD FLOWS I WANT TO HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS.

HOW DID WE GET CAUGHT UP FIGHTING THIS FOREST FIRE,

WE, WHO WERE ONLY LOOKING FOR A STILL PLACE IN THE WOODS?

HOW FRAIL WE ARE, AND YET, DISPERSED, ALWAYS RETURNING,

THE BARNACLES THEY KEEP SCRAPING FROM THE WARSHIP’S HULL.

THE HAIRS ON YOUR BREAST CURL SO LIGHTLY AS YOU LIE THERE,

WHILE THE STRONG HEART GOES ON POUNDING IN ITS SLEEP.

IN ITSELF, EVERY IDEA IS NEUTRAL, OR SHOULD BE; BUT MAN ANIMATES IDEAS, PROJECTS HIS FLAMES AND FLAWS INTO THEM; IMPURE, TRANSFORMED INTO BELIEFS, IDEAS TAKE THEIR PLACE IN TIME, TAKE SHAPE AS EVENTS: THE TRAJECTORY IS COMPLETE, FROM LOGIC TO EPILEPSY . . . WHENCE THE BIRTH OF IDEOLOGIES, DOCTRINES, DEADLY GAMES.

IDOLATERS BY INSTINCT, WE CONVERT THE OBJECTS OF OUR DREAMS AND OUR INTERESTS INTO THE UNCONDITIONAL HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT A PROCESSION OF FALSE ABSOLUTES, A SERIES OF TEMPLES RAISED TO PRETEXTS, A DEGRADATION OF THE MIND BEFORE THE IMPROBABLE. EVEN WHEN HE TURNS FROM RELIGION, MAN REMAINS SUBJECT TO IT; DEPLETING HIMSELF TO CREATE FAKE GODS, HE THEN FEVERISHLY ADOPTS THEM: HIS NEED FOR FICTION, FOR MYTHOLOGY TRIUMPHS OVER EVIDENCE AND ABSURDITY ALIKE. HIS POWER TO ADORE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL HIS CRIMES: A MAN WHO LOVES A GOD UNDULY FORCES OTHER MEN TO LOVE HIS GOD, EAGER TO EXTERMINATE THEM IF THEY REFUSE. THERE IS NO FORM OF INTOLERANCE, OF PROSELYTISM OR IDEOLOGICAL INTRANSIGENCE WHICH FAILS TO REVEAL THE BESTIAL SUBSTRATUM OF ENTHUSIASM. ONCE MAN LOSES HIS FACULTY OF INDIFFERENCE HE BECOMES A POTENTIAL MURDERER; ONCE HE TRANSFORMS HIS IDEA INTO A GOD THE CONSEQUENCES ARE INCALCULABLE. WE KILL ONLY IN THE NAME OF A GOD OR OF HIS COUNTERFEITS: THE EXCESSES PROVOKED BY THE GODDESS REASON, BY THE CONCEPT OF NATION, CLASS, OR RACE ARE AKIN TO THOSE OF THE INQUISITION OR OF THE REFORMATION. THE AGES OF FERVOR ABOUND IN BLOODY EXPLOITS: A SAINT TERESA COULD ONLY BE THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE AUTO-DA-FÉ, A LUTHER OF THE REPRESSION OF THE PEASANTS’ REVOLT. IN EVERY MYSTIC OUTBURST, THE MOANS OF VICTIMS PARALLEL THE MOANS OF ECSTASY. . . . SCAFFOLDS, DUNGEONS, JAILS FLOURISH ONLY IN THE SHADOW OF A FAITH—OF THAT NEED TO BELIEVE WHICH HAS INFESTED THE MIND FOREVER. THE DEVIL PALES BESIDE THE MAN WHO OWNS A TRUTH, HIS TRUTH. WE ARE UNFAIR TO A NERO, A TIBERIUS: IT WAS NOT THEY WHO INVENTED THE CONCEPT HERETIC: THEY WERE ONLY DEGENERATE DREAMERS WHO HAPPENED TO BE ENTERTAINED BY MASSACRES. THE REAL CRIMINALS ARE MEN WHO ESTABLISH AN ORTHODOXY ON THE RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL LEVEL, MEN WHO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE FAITHFUL AND THE SCHISMATIC.

WHEN WE REFUSE TO ADMIT THE INTERCHANGEABLE CHARACTER OF IDEAS, BLOOD FLOWS . . . FIRM RESOLVES DRAW THE DAGGER; FIERY EYES PRESAGE SLAUGHTER. NO WAVERING MIND, INFECTED WITH HAMLETISM, WAS EVER PERNICIOUS: THE PRINCIPLE OF EVIL LIES IN THE WILL’S TENSION, IN THE INCAPACITY FOR QUIETISM, IN THE PROMETHEAN MEGALOMANIA OF A RACE THAT BURSTS WITH IDEALS, THAT EXPLODES WITH ITS CONVICTIONS, AND THAT, IN RETURN FOR HAVING FORSAKEN DOUBT AND SLOTH—VICES NOBLER THAN ALL ITS VIRTUES-—HAS TAKEN THE PATH TO PERDITION, INTO HISTORY, THAT INDECENT ALLOY OF BANALITY AND APOCALYPSE. . . . HERE CERTITUDES ABOUND: SUPPRESS THEM, BEST OF ALL SUPPRESS THEIR CONSEQUENCES, AND YOU RECOVER PARADISE. WHAT IS THE FALL BUT THE PURSUIT OF A TRUTH AND THE ASSURANCE YOU HAVE FOUND IT, THE PASSION FOR A DOGMA, DOMICILE WITHIN A DOGMA? THE RESULT IS FANATICISM—FUNDAMENTAL DEFECT WHICH GIVES MAN THE CRAVING FOR EFFECTIVENESS, FOR PROPHECY, FOR TERROR—A LYRICAL LEPROSY BY WHICH HE CONTAMINATES SOULS, SUBDUES THEM, CRUSHES OR EXALTS THEM. . . . ONLY THE SKEPTICS (OR IDLERS OR AESTHETES) ESCAPE, BECAUSE THEY PROPOSE NOTHING, BECAUSE THEY—HUMANITY’S TRUE BENEFACTORS—UNDERMINE FANATICISM’S PURPOSES, ANALYZE ITS FRENZY. I FEEL SAFER WITH A PYRRHO THAN WITH A SAINT PAUL, FOR A JESTING WISDOM IS GENTLER THAN AN UNBRIDLED SANCTITY. IN THE FERVENT MIND YOU ALWAYS FIND THE CAMOUFLAGED BEAST OF PREY; NO PROTECTION IS ADEQUATE AGAINST THE CLAWS OF A PROPHET. . . . ONCE HE RAISES HIS VOICE, WHETHER IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN, OF THE CITY, OR SOME OTHER EXCUSE, AWAY WITH YOU: SATYR OF YOUR SOLITUDE, HE WILL NOT FORGIVE YOUR LIVING ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HIS TRUTHS AND HIS TRANSPORTS; HE WANTS YOU TO SHARE HIS HYSTERIA, HIS FULLNESS, HE WANTS TO IMPOSE IT ON YOU, AND THEREBY TO DISFIGURE YOU. A HUMAN BEING POSSESSED BY A BELIEF AND NOT EAGER TO PASS IT ON TO OTHERS IS A PHENOMENON ALIEN TO THE EARTH, WHERE OUR MANIA FOR SALVATION MAKES LIFE UNBREATHABLE. LOOK AROUND YOU: EVERYWHERE, SPECTERS PREACHING; EACH INSTITUTION TRANSLATES A MISSION; CITY HALLS HAVE THEIR ABSOLUTE, EVEN AS THE TEMPLES—OFFICIALDOM, WITH ITS RULES—A METAPHYSICS DESIGNED FOR MONKEYS. . . EVERYONE TRYING TO REMEDY EVERYONE’S LIFE: EVEN BEGGARS, EVEN THE INCURABLE ASPIRE TO IT: THE SIDEWALKS AND HOSPITALS OF THE WORLD OVERFLOW WITH REFORMERS. THE LONGING TO BECOME A SOURCE OF EVENTS AFFECTS EACH MAN LIKE A MENTAL DISORDER OR A DESIRED MALEDICTION. SOCIETY—AN INFERNO OF SAVIORS! WHAT DIOGENES WAS LOOKING FOR WITH HIS LANTERN WAS AN INDIFFERENT MAN. . . .

IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO HEAR SOMEONE TALK SINCERELY ABOUT IDEALS, ABOUT THE FUTURE, ABOUT PHILOSOPHY, TO HEAR HIM SAY “WE” WITH A CERTAIN INFLECTION OF ASSURANCE, TO HEAR HIM INVOKE “OTHERS” AND REGARD HIMSELF AS THEIR INTERPRETER—-FOR ME TO CONSIDER HIM MY ENEMY. I SEE IN HIM A TYRANT MANQUÉ AN APPROXIMATE EXECUTIONER, QUITE AS DETESTABLE AS THE FIRST-RATE TYRANTS, THE FIRST-RATE EXECUTIONERS EVERY FAITH PRACTICES SOME FORM OF TERROR, ALL THE MORE DREADFUL WHEN THE “PURE” ARE ITS AGENTS. WE MISTRUST THE SWINDLER, THE TRICKSTER, THE CON MAN; YET TO THEM WE CAN IMPUTE NONE OF HISTORY’S GREAT CONVULSIONS; BELIEVING IN NOTHING, IT IS NOT THEY WHO RUMMAGE IN YOUR HEARTS, OR YOUR ULTERIOR MOTIVES; THEY LEAVE YOU TO YOUR APATHY, TO YOUR DESPAIR OR TO YOUR USELESSNESS; TO THEM HUMANITY OWES THE FEW MOMENTS OF PROSPERITY IT HAS KNOWN: IT IS THEY WHO SAVE THE PEOPLES WHOM FANATICS TORTURE AND “IDEALISTS” DESTROY. DOCTRINELESS, THEY HAVE ONLY WHIMS AND INTERESTS, ACCOMMODATING VICES A THOUSAND TIMES MORE ENDURABLE THAN THE RAVAGES PROVOKED BY PRINCIPLED DESPOTISM; FOR ALL OF LIFE’S EVILS COME FROM A “CONCEPTION OF LIFE.” AN ACCOMPLISHED POLITICIAN SHOULD SEARCH OUT THE ANCIENT SOPHISTS AND TAKE LESSONS IN ORATORY—AND IN CORRUPTION. . . .

WHEREAS THE FANATIC IS INCORRUPTIBLE: IF HE KILLS FOR AN IDEA, HE CAN JUST AS WELL GET HIMSELF KILLED FOR ONE; IN EITHER CASE, TYRANT OR MARTYR, HE IS A MONSTER. NO HUMAN BEINGS MORE DANGEROUS THAN THOSE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FOR A BELIEF: THE GREAT PERSECUTORS ARE RECRUITED AMONG THE MARTYRS NOT QUITE BEHEADED. FAR FROM DIMINISHING THE APPETITE FOR POWER, SUFFERING EXASPERATES IT; HENCE THE MIND FEELS MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE SOCIETY OF A BRAGGART THAN IN THAT OF A MARTYR; AND NOTHING IS MORE REPUGNANT TO IT THAN THE SPECTACLE OF DYING FOR AN IDEA. . . . REVOLTED BY THE SUBLIME AND BY CARNAGE, THE MIND DREAMS OF A PROVINCIAL ENNUI ON THE SCALE OF THE UNIVERSE, OF A HISTORY WHOSE STAGNATION WOULD BE SO GROT THAT DOUBT WOULD TAKE ON THE LINEAMENTS OF AN EVENT AND HOPE A CALAMITY. . .

THE ANTI-PROPHET
IN EVERY MAN SLEEPS A PROPHET, AND WHEN HE WAKES THERE IS A LITTLE MORE EVIL IN THE WORLD. . . .

THE COMPULSION TO PREACH IS SO ROOTED IN US THAT IT EMERGES FROM DEPTHS UNKNOWN TO THE INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION. EACH OF US AWAITS HIS MOMENT IN ORDER TO PROPOSE SOMETHING—ANYTHING. HE HAS A VOICE: THAT IS ENOUGH. IT COSTS US DEAR TO BE NEITHER DEAF NOR DUMB. . . .

FROM SNOBS TO SCAVENGERS, ALL EXPEND THEIR CRIMINAL GENEROSITY, ALL HAND OUT FORMULAS FOR HAPPINESS, ALL TRY TO GIVE DIRECTIONS: LIFE IN COMMON THEREBY BECOMES INTOLERABLE, AND LIFE WITH ONESELF STILL MORE SO; IF YOU FAIL TO MEDDLE IN OTHER PEOPLE’S BUSINESS YOU ARE SO UNEASY ABOUT YOUR, OWN THAT YOU CONVERT YOUR “SELF” INTO A RELIGION, OR, APOSTLE IN REVERSE, YOU DENY IT ALTOGETHER; WE ARE VICTIMS OF THE UNIVERSAL GAME. . . .

THE ABUNDANCE OF SOLUTIONS TO THE ASPECTS OF EXISTENCE IS EQUALED ONLY BY THEIR FUTILITY. HISTORY: A FACTORY OF IDEALS . . . LUNATIC MYTHOLOGY, FRENZY OF HORDES AND ©F SOLITARIES . . . REFUSAL TO LOOK REALITY IN THE FACE, MORTAL THIRST FOR FICTIONS. . . .

THE SOURCE OF OUR ACTIONS RESIDES IN AN UNCONSCIOUS PROPENSITY TO REGARD OURSELVES AS THE CENTER, THE CAUSE, AND THE CONCLUSION OF TIME. OUR REFLEXES AND OUR PRIDE TRANSFORM INTO A PLANET THE PARCEL OF FLESH AND CONSCIOUSNESS WE ARE. IF WE HAD THE RIGHT SENSE OF OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD, IF TO COMPARE WERE INSEPARABLE FROM TO LIVE, THE REVELATION OF OUR INFINITESIMAL PRESENCE WOULD CRUSH US. BUT TO LIVE IS TO BLIND OURSELVES TO OUR OWN DIMENSIONS. . . .

AND IF ALL OUR ACTIONS—FROM BREATHING TO THE FOUNDING OF EMPIRES OR METAPHYSICAL SYSTEMS—DERIVE FROM AN ILLUSION AS TO OUR IMPORTANCE, THE SAME IS TRUE A FORTIORI OF THE PROPHETIC INSTINCT. WHO, WITH THE EXACT VISION OF HIS NULLITY, WOULD TRY TO BE EFFECTIVE AND TO TURN HIMSELF INTO A SAVIOR?

NOSTALGIA FOR A WORLD WITHOUT “IDEALS,” FOR AN AGONY WITHOUT DOCTRINE, FOR AN ETERNITY WITHOUT LIFE . . . PARADISE. . . . BUT WE COULD NOT EXIST ONE SECOND WITHOUT DECEIVING OURSELVES: THE PROPHET IN EACH OF US IS JUST THE SEED OF MADNESS WHICH MAKES US FLOURISH IN OUR VOID.

THE IDEALLY LUCID, HENCE IDEALLY NORMAL, MAN SHOULD HAVE NO RECOURSE BEYOND THE NOTHING THAT IS IN HIM. . . . I CAN IMAGINE HIM SAYING: “TORN FROM THE GOAL, FROM ALL GOALS, I RETAIN, OF MY DESIRES AND MY DISPLEASURES, ONLY THEIR FORMULAS. HAVING RESISTED THE TEMPTATION TO CONCLUDE, I HAVE OVERCOME THE MIND, AS I HAVE OVERCOME LIFE ITSELF BY THE HORROR OF LOOKING FOR AN ANSWER TO IT. THE SPECTACLE OF MAN—WHAT AN EMETIC! LOVE—A DUEL OF SALIVAS. .. . ALL THE FEELINGS MILK THEIR ABSOLUTE FROM THE MISERY OF THE GLANDS. NOBILITY IS ONLY IN THE NEGATION OF EXISTENCE, IN A SMILE THAT SURVEYS ANNIHILATED LANDSCAPES. ONCE I HAD A 'SELF; NOW I AM NO MORE THAN AN OBJECT .. . I GORGE MYSELF ON ALL THE DRUGS OF SOLITUDE; THOSE OF THE WORLD WERE TOO WEAK TO MAKE ME FORGET IT. HAVING KILLED THE PROPHET IN ME, HOW COULD I STILL HAVE A PLACE AMONG MEN?”

IN THE GRAVEYARD OF DEFINITIONS
ARE WE ENTITLED TO IMAGINE A MIND EXCLAIMING: “EVERYTHING IS PURPOSELESS TO ME NOW, FOR I HAVE GIVEN THE DEFINITIONS OF ALL THINGS"? AND IF WE COULD IMAGINE SUCH A MIND, HOW LOCATE IT WITHIN DURATION?

WHAT SURROUNDS US WE ENDURE BETTER FOR GIVING IT A NAME—AND MOVING ON. BUT TO EMBRACE A THING BY A DEFINITION, HOWEVER ARBITRARY—AND ALL THE MORE SERIOUS THE MORE ARBITRARY IT IS, SINCE THE SOUL THEN OVERTAKES KNOWLEDGE—IS TO REJECT THAT THING, TO RENDER IT INSIPID AND SUPERFLUOUS, TO ANNIHILATE IT. THE IDLE, EMPTY MIND—WHICH JOINS THE WORLD ONLY BY THE GRACE OF SLEEP—CAN PRACTICE ONLY BY EXTENDING THE NAME OF THINGS, BY EMPTYING DIEM AND SUBSTITUTING FORMULAS FOR THEM. THEN IT MANEUVERS OVER THEIR DEBRIS; NO MORE SENSATIONS; NOTHING BUT MEMORIES. UNDER EACH FORMULA LIES A CORPSE: BEING AND OBJECT ALIKE DIE UNDER THE PRETEXT THEY HAVE OCCASIONED.

THIS IS THE MIND’S FRIVOLOUS, FUNEREAL DEBAUCH. AND THIS MIND HAS SQUANDERED ITSELF IN WHAT IT HAS NAMED AND CIRCUMSCRIBED. INFATUATED BY SYLLABLES, IT LOATHED THE MYSTERY OF HEAVY SILENCES AND TURNED THEM LIGHT AND PURE; AND IT TOO HAS BECOME LIGHT AND PURE, INDEED LIGHTENED AND PURIFIED OF EVERYTHING. THE VICE OF DEFINING HAS MADE IT A GRACIOUS ASSASSIN, AND A DISCREET VICTIM.

THIS IS HOW THE STAIN THE SOUL SPREAD OVER THE MIND HAS BEEN REMOVED-—THE ONLY THING WHICH REMINDED IT THAT IT WAS ALIVE.

CIVILIZATION AND FRIVOLITY
HOW COULD WE BEAR THE WEIGHT AND SHEER DEPTH OF WORKS AND MASTERPIECES, IF TO THEIR TEXTURE CERTAIN IMPERTINENT AND DELICIOUS MINDS HAD NOT ADDED THE FRINGES OF SUBTLE SCORN AND READY IRONIES? AND HOW COULD WE ENDURE THE CODES, THE CUSTOMS, THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE HEART WHICH INERTIA AND PROPRIETY HAVE SUPERIMPOSED UPON THE FUTILE AND INTELLIGENT VICES, IF IT WERE NOT FOR THOSE PLAYFUL BEINGS WHOSE REFINEMENT PUTS THEM AT ONCE AT THE APEX AND IN THE MARGIN OF SOCIETY?

WE MUST BE THANKFUL TO THE CIVILIZATIONS WHICH HAVE NOT TAKEN AN OVERDOSE OF SERIOUSNESS, WHICH HAVE PLAYED WITH VALUES AND TAKEN THEIR PLEASURE IN BEGETTING AND DESTROYING THEM. WHO KNOWS, OUTSIDE OF THE GREEK AND FRENCH CIVILIZATIONS, A MORE LUCIDLY FACETIOUS PROOF OF THE ELEGANT NOTHINGNESS OF THINGS? THE AGE OF ALCIBIADES AND THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY IN FRANCE ARE TWO SOURCES OF CONSOLATION. WHILE IT IS ONLY AT THEIR FINAL STAGES, AT THE DISSOLUTION OF A WHOLE SYSTEM OF BEHAVIOR AND BELIEF, THAT THE OTHER CIVILIZATIONS COULD ENJOY THAT LIVELY EXERCISE WHICH LENDS A FLAVOR OF FUTILITY TO LIFE, IT WAS IN FULL RIPENESS, IN FULL POSSESSION OF THEIR POWERS AND OF THE FUTURE THAT THESE TWO EPOCHS KNEW THE TEDIUM HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING AND PERMEABLE TO EVERYTHING. WHAT BETTER SYMBOL THAN THAT OF MADAME DU DEFFAND, OLD, BLIND, AND PERSPICACIOUS, WHO EVEN WHILE EXECRATING LIFE, NONETHELESS RELISHED TO THE LAST ITS EVERY AMENITY OF GALL?

NO ONE ACHIEVES FRIVOLITY STRAIGHT OFF. IT IS A PRIVILEGE AND AN ART; IT IS THE PURSUIT OF THE SUPERFICIAL BY THOSE WHO, HAVING DISCERNED THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ANY CERTITUDE, HAVE CONCEIVED A DISGUST FOR SUCH THINGS; IT IS THE ESCAPE FAR FROM ONE ABYSS OR ANOTHER WHICH, BEING BY NATURE BOTTOMLESS, CAN LEAD NOWHERE.

THERE REMAIN, NONETHELESS, THE APPEARANCES; WHY NOT RAISE THEM TO THE LEVEL OF A STYLE? THEREBY WE DEFINE EVERY INTELLIGENT PERIOD. THEREBY WE FIND MORE PRESTIGE IN EXPRESSION THAN IN THE SOUL WHICH SUPPORTS IT, IN GRACE THAN IN INTUITION; EMOTION ITSELF BECOMES POLITE. THE HUMAN BEING DELIVERED TO HIMSELF, WITHOUT ANY PARTIALITY FOR ELEGANCE, IS A MONSTER; HE FINDS ONLY DARK REGIONS THERE, WHERE TERROR AND NEGATION, IMMINENT, PROWL TO KNOW, BY ALL ONE’S VITALITY, THAT ONE WILL DIE, AND TO BE UNABLE TO CONCEAL IT, IS AN ACT OF BARBARISM. ANY SINCERE PHILOSOPHY RENOUNCES THE CLAIMS OF CIVILIZATION, WHOSE FUNCTION CONSISTS IN SIFTING OUR SECRETS AND DISGUISING THEM AS RECHERCHÉ EFFECTS. THUS, FRIVOLITY IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE ANTIDOTE TO THE DISEASE OF BEING WHAT ONE IS: BY FRIVOLITY WE ABUSE THE WORLD AND DISSIMULATE THE IMPROPRIETY OF OUR DEPTHS. WITHOUT ITS ARTIFICES, HOW COULD WE HELP BLUSHING TO HAVE A SOUL? OUR SKIN-DEEP SOLITUDES, WHAT AN INFERNO FOR OTHER PEOPLE! BUT IT IS ALWAYS FOR THEM, AND SOMETIMES FOR OURSELVES, THAT WE INVENT OUR APPEARANCES. . . .

DISSOLVING INTO GOD
THE MIND SCRUPULOUS OF ITS DISTINCT ESSENCE IS THREATENED AT EVERY TURN BY THE THINGS IT REJECTS. OFTEN ABANDONING ATTENTION—THE GREATEST OF ITS PRIVILEGES—SUCH A MIND YIELDS TO THE TEMPTATIONS IT HAS SOUGHT TO ESCAPE, OR BECOMES THE PREY OF IMPURE MYSTERIES . . . WHO HAS NOT KNOWN THOSE FEARS, THOSE DIZZY SPELLS, THOSE DELIRIUMS WHICH BRING US BACK TO THE BEAST, BACK TO THE LAST PROBLEMS? OUR KNEES TREMBLE BUT DO NOT BEND; OUR HANDS CLUTCH WITHOUT CLASPING EACH OTHER; OUR EYES LOOK UP AND SEE NOTHING. . . . WE PRESERVE THAT VERTICAL PRIDE WHICH STRENGTHENS ITS COURAGE; THAT HORROR OF GESTURES WHICH SAVES US FROM SPECTACLE; AND THE SUCCOR OF EYELIDS TO VEIL AN ABSURDLY INEFFABLE GAZE. OUR COLLAPSE IS IMMINENT BUT NOT INEVITABLE; THE ACCIDENT IS ODD, BUT SCARCELY NEW; ALREADY A SMILE DAWNS ON THE HORIZON OF OUR TERRORS . . . WE SHALL NOT TOPPLE INTO PRAYER. . . FOR AFTER ALL HE MUST NOT TRIUMPH; IT IS UP TO OUR IRONY TO COMPROMISE HIS CAPITAL LETTER; UP TO OUR HEART TO DISSOLVE THE SHUDDERS HE DISPENSES.

IF SUCH A BEING REALLY EXISTED, IF OUR WEAKNESSES VANQUISHED OUR RESOLUTIONS AND OUR DEPTHS OUR DELIBERATIONS, THEN WHY GO ON THINKING, SINCE OUR DIFFICULTIES WOULD BE SETTLED, OUR QUESTIONS SUSPENDED, AND OUR FEARS ALLAYED? WHICH WOULD BE TOO EASY. EVERY ABSOLUTE—PERSONAL OR ABSTRACT—IS A WAY OF AVOIDING THE PROBLEMS, AND NOT ONLY THE PROBLEMS BUT ALSO THEIR ROOT, WHICH IS NOTHING BUT A PANIC OF THE SENSES.

GOD: A PERPENDICULAR FALL UPON OUR FEAR, A SALVATION LANDING LIKE A THUNDERBOLT AMID OUR INVESTIGATIONS WHICH NO HOPE DECEIVES, THE IMMEDIATE ANNIHILATION OF OUR UNCONSOLED AND DETERMINEDLY INCONSCIABLE PRIDE, A SIDETRACKING OF THE INDIVIDUAL, THE SOUL ON THE DOLE FOR LACK OF ANXIETY. . .

WHAT GREATER RENUNCIATION THAN FAITH? TRUE, WITHOUT IT WE ARE COMMITTED TO AN INFINITY OF DEAD ENDS BUT EVEN WHEN WE KNOW THAT NOTHING LEADS ANYWHERE, THAT THE UNIVERSE IS ONLY A BY-PRODUCT OF OUR GLOOM, WHY SHOULD WE SACRIFICE THIS PLEASURE OF TOTTERING AND OF SPLITTING OUR SKULLS AGAINST HEAVEN AND EARTH?

THE SOLUTIONS OFFERED BY OUR ANCESTRAL COWARDICE ARE THE WORST DESERTIONS OF OUR DUTY TO INTELLECTUAL DECENCY. TO BE FOOLED, TO LIVE AND DIE DUPED, IS CERTAINLY WHAT MEN DO BUT THERE EXISTS A DIGNITY WHICH KEEPS US FROM DISAPPEARING INTO GOD AND WHICH TRANSFORMS ALL OUR MOMENTS INTO PRAYERS WE SHALL NEVER OFFER.

VARIATIONS ON DEATH
I. IT IS BECAUSE IT RESTS ON NOTHING, BECAUSE IT LACKS EVEN THE SHADOW OF AN ARGUMENT THAT WE PERSEVERE IN LIFE. DEATH IS TOO EXACT; IT HAS ALL THE REASONS ON ITS SIDE. MYSTERIOUS FOR OUR INSTINCTS, IT TAKES SHAPE, TO OUR REFLECTION, LIMPID, WITHOUT GLAMOR, AND WITHOUT THE FALSE LURES OF THE UNKNOWN.

BY DINT OF ACCUMULATING NON-MYSTERIES AND MONOPOLIZING NON-MEANINGS, LIFE INSPIRES MORE DREAD THAN DEATH: IT IS LIFE WHICH IS THE GREAT UNKNOWN.

WHERE CAN SO MUCH VOID AND INCOMPREHENSIBILITY LEAD? WE CLING TO THE DAYS BECAUSE THE DESIRE TO DIE IS TOO LOGICAL, HENCE INEFFECTIVE. IF LIFE HAD A SINGLE ARGUMENT IN ITS FAVOR—DISTINCT, INDISPUTABLE—IT WOULD ANNIHILATE ITSELF; INSTINCTS AND PREJUDICES COLLAPSE AT THE CONTACT OF RIGOR. EVERYTHING THAT BREATHES FEEDS ON THE UNVERIFIABLE; A DOSE OF LOGIC WOULD BE DEADLY TO EXISTENCE—THAT EFFORT TOWARD THE SENSELESS. . . . GIVE LIFE A SPECIFIC GOAL AND IT IMMEDIATELY LOSES ITS ATTRACTION. THE INEXACTITUDE OF ITS ENDS MAKES LIFE SUPERIOR TO DEATH; ONE TOUCH OF PRECISION WOULD DEGRADE IT TO THE TRIVIALITY OF THE TOMBS. FOR A POSITIVE SCIENCE OF THE MEANING OF LIFE WOULD DEPOPULATE THE EARTH IN A DAY, AND NOT EVEN A MADMAN COULD SUCCEED IN REVIVING THE FRUITFUL IMPROBABILITY OF DESIRE.

II. MEN CAN BE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE MOST WHIMSICAL CRITERIA: ACCORDING TO THEIR HUMORS, THEIR INCLINATIONS, THEIR DREAMS, OR THEIR GLANDS. WE CHANGE IDEAS LIKE NECKTIES; FOR EVERY IDEA, EVERY CRITERION COMES FROM OUTSIDE, FROM THE CONFIGURATIONS AND ACCIDENTS OF TIME. BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT COMES FROM OURSELVES, THAT IS OURSELVES, AN INVISIBLE BUT INWARDLY VERIFIABLE REALITY, AN UNWONTED AND ETERNAL PRESENCE THAT WE CAN CONCEIVE AT ANY MOMENT AND THAT WE NEVER DARE ADMIT, WHICH IS REAL ONLY BEFORE ITS CONSUMMATION: DEATH, THE TRUE CRITERION. . . . AND IT IS DEATH, THE MOST INTIMATE DIMENSION OF ALL THE LIVING, WHICH SEPARATES HUMANITY INTO TWO ORDERS SO IRREDUCIBLE, SO REMOVED FROM EACH OTHER, THAT THERE IS MORE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM THAN BETWEEN A VULTURE AND A MOLE, A STAR AND A STARFISH. THE ABYSS OF TWO INCOMMUNICABLE WORLDS OPENS BETWEEN THE MAN WHO HAS THE SENTIMENT OF DEATH AND THE MAN WHO DOES NOT; YET BOTH DIE; BUT ONE IS UNAWARE OF HIS DEATH, THE OTHER KNOWS-, ONE DIES ONLY FOR A MOMENT, THE OTHER UNCEASINGLY. . . . THEIR COMMON CONDITION LOCATES THEM PRECISELY AT EACH OTHER’S ANTIPODES, AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES AND WITHIN ONE AND THE SAME DEFINITION; IRRECONCILABLE, THEY SUFFER THE SAME FATE. . . . ONE LIVES AS IF HE WERE ETERNAL; THE OTHER THINKS CONTINUALLY OF HIS ETERNITY AND DENIES IT IN EACH THOUGHT.

NOTHING CAN CHANGE OUR LIFE BUT THE GRADUAL INSINUATION WITHIN US OF THE FORCES WHICH ANNIHILATE IT. NO NEW PRINCIPLE COMES TO IT FROM THE SURPRISES OF OUR GROWTH NOR FROM THE EFFLORESCENCE OF OUR GIFTS; THEY ARE MERELY NATURAL TO IT. AND NOTHING NATURAL CAN MAKE US ANYTHING BUT OURSELVES.

EVERYTHING WHICH PREFIGURES DEATH ADDS A QUALITY OF NOVELTY TO LIFE, MODIFIES AND AMPLIFIES IT. HEALTH PRESERVES LIFE AS SUCH, IN A STERILE IDENTITY; WHILE DISEASE IS AN ACTIVITY, THE MOST INTENSE A MAN CAN INDULGE IN, A FRENETIC AND . . . STATIONARY MOVEMENT, THE RICHEST EXPENDITURE OF ENERGY WITHOUT GESTURE, THE HOSTILE AND IMPASSIONED EXPECTATION OF AN IRREPARABLE LIGHTNING BOLT.

III. AGAINST THE OBSESSION WITH DEATH, BOTH THE SUBTERFUGES OF HOPE AND THE ARGUMENTS OF REASON LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS: THEIR INSIGNIFICANCE MERELY WHETS THE APPETITE TO DIE. IN ORDER TO TRIUMPH OVER THIS APPETITE, THERE IS BUT ONE “METHOD": TO LIVE IT TO THE END, TO SUBMIT TO ALL ITS PLEASURES, ALL ITS PANGS, TO DO NOTHING TO ELUDE IT. AN OBSESSION EXPERIENCED TO THE POINT OF SATIETY IS ANNIHILATED IN ITS OWN EXCESSES. BY DWELLING ON THE INFINITY OF DEATH, THOUGHT MANAGES TO USE IT UP TO INSPIRE DISGUST FOR IT IN US, DISGUST, THAT NEGATIVE SUPERFLUITY WHICH SPARES NOTHING AND WHICH, BEFORE COMPROMISING AND DIMINISHING THE PRESTIGE OF DEATH, SHOWS US THE INANITY OF LIFE.

THE MAN WHO HAS NOT GIVEN HIMSELF UP TO THE PLEASURES OF ANGUISH, WHO HAS NOT SAVORED IN HIS MIND THE DANGERS OF HIS OWN EXTINCTION NOR RELISHED SUCH CRUEL AND SWEET ANNIHILATIONS, WILL NEVER BE CURED OF THE OBSESSION WITH DEATH: HE WILL BE TORMENTED BY IT, FOR HE WILL HAVE RESISTED IT; WHILE THE MAN WHO, HABITUATED TO A DISCIPLINE OF HORROR, AND MEDITATING UPON HIS OWN CARRION, HAS DELIBERATELY REDUCED HIMSELF TO ASHES—THAT MAN WILL LOOK TOWARD DEATH’S PAST, AND HE HIMSELF WILL BE MERELY A RESURRECTED BEING WHO CAN NO LONGER LIVE. HIS “METHOD” WILL HAVE CURED HIM OF BOTH LIFE AND DEATH.

EVERY CRUCIAL EXPERIENCE IS FATAL: THE LAYERS OF EXISTENCE LACK DENSITY; THE MAN WHO EXPLORES THEM, ARCHAEOLOGIST OF THE HEART, OF BEING, FINDS HIMSELF, AT THE END OF HIS RESEARCHES, CONFRONTING EMPTY DEPTHS. HE WILL VAINLY REGRET THE PANOPLY OF APPEARANCES.

HENCE THE ANCIENT MYSTERIES, SO-CALLED REVELATIONS OF THE ULTIMATE SECRETS, HAVE BEQUEATHED US NOTHING BY WAY OF KNOWLEDGE. THE INITIATES WERE DOUBTLESS OBLIGED TO KEEP SILENCE; YET IT IS INCONCEIVABLE THAT NOT A SINGLE CHATTERBOX WAS AMONG THEIR NUMBER; WHAT IS MORE CONTRARY TO HUMAN NATURE THAN SUCH STUBBORNNESS IN SECRECY? THE FACT IS THAT THERE WERE NO SECRETS; THERE WERE RITES, THERE WERE SHUDDERS. ONCE THE VEILS HAD FALLEN, WHAT COULD THEY DISCOVER BUT INSIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES? THE ONLY INITIATION IS TO NOTHINGNESS—AND TO THE MOCKERY OF BEING ALIVE, . . . AND I DREAM OF AN ELEUSIS OF DISABUSED HEARTS, OF A LUCID MYSTERY, WITHOUT GODS AND WITHOUT THE VEHEMENCES OF ILLUSION.

IN THE MARGIN OF MOMENTS
IT IS OUR INCAPACITY TO WEEP WHICH SUSTAINS OUR TASTE FOR THINGS, WHICH MAKES THEM EXIST AT ALL: IT KEEPS US FROM EXHAUSTING THEIR SAVOR AND FROM TURNING AWAY. WHEN, ON SO MANY BRINKS AND BYROADS, OUR EYES REFUSED TO DROWN IN THEMSELVES, THEIR DRYNESS PRESERVED THE OBJECT WHICH AMAZED THEM. OUR TEARS SQUANDER NATURE, AS OUR TERRORS DO GOD . . . BUT IN THE END, THEY SQUANDER OURSELVES. FOR WE EXIST ONLY BY THE REFUSAL TO GIVE FREE REIN TO OUR SUPREME DESIRES: THE THINGS WHICH ENTER THE SPHERE OF OUR ADMIRATION OR OUR DESPAIR REMAIN THERE ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE NEITHER SACRIFICED THEM NOR BLESSED THEM WITH OUR LIQUID FAREWELLS.

SO IT IS THAT AFTER EACH NIGHT, FACING A NEW DAY, THE IMPOSSIBLE NECESSITY OF DEALING WITH IT FILLS US WITH DREAD; EXILED IN LIGHT AS IF THE WORLD HAD JUST STARTED, INVENTING THE SUN, WE FLEE FROM TEARS—JUST ONE OF WHICH WOULD BE ENOUGH TO WASH US OUT OF TIME.

DISLOCATION OF TIME
THE MOMENTS FOLLOW EACH OTHER; NOTHING LENDS THEM THE ILLUSION OF A CONTENT OR THE APPEARANCE OF A MEANING; THEY PASS; THEIR COURSE IS NOT OURS; WE CONTEMPLATE THAT PASSAGE, PRISONERS OF A STUPID PERCEPTION. THE HEART’S VOID CONFRONTING TIME’S: TWO MIRRORS, REFLECTING EACH OTHER’S ABSENCE, ONE AND THE SAME IMAGE OF NULLITY. .. . AS THOUGH BY THE EFFECT OF A DREAMY IDIOCY, EVERYTHING IS LEVELED: NO MORE PEAKS, NO MORE PLUNGES. . . . WHERE TO LOCATE THE POETRY OF LIES, THE GOAD OF AN ENIGMA?

THE MAN WHO KNOWS NOTHING OF ENNUI IS STILL IN THE WORLD’S CHILDHOOD, WHEN THE AGES WERE WAITING TO BE BORN; HE REMAINS CLOSED OFF FROM THAT TIRED TIME WHICH OUTLIVES ITSELF, WHICH LAUGHS AT ITS DIMENSIONS, AND SUCCUMBS ON THE THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN . . . FUTURE, DRAGGING ALONG MATTER, SUDDENLY RAISED TO A LYRICISM OF NEGATION. ENNUI IS THE ECHO IN US OF TIME TEARING ITSELF APART . . . THE REVELATION OF THE VOID, THE DRYING UP OF THAT DELIRIUM WHICH SUSTAINS—OR INVENTS—LIFE. . . .

CREATOR OF VALUES, MAN IS THE DELIRIOUS CREATURE PAR EXCELLENCE VICTIM OF THE BELIEF THAT SOMETHING EXISTS, WHEREAS HE NEED MERELY HOLD HIS BREATH: EVERYTHING STOPS; SUSPEND HIS EMOTIONS: NOTHING STIRS; SUPPRESS HIS WHIMS: THE WORLD TURNS TO ASHES. REALITY IS A CREATION OF OUR EXCESSES, OF OUR DISPROPORTIONS AND DERANGEMENTS. REIN IN YOUR PALPITATIONS AND THE COURSE OF EVENTS SLOWS DOWN; WITHOUT OUR ARDORS, SPACE IS ICE. TIME ITSELF PASSES ONLY BECAUSE OUR DESIRES BEGET THAT DECORATIVE UNIVERSE WHICH A JOT OF LUCIDITY WOULD LAY BARE. ONE TOUCH OF CLEARSIGHTEDNESS REDUCES US TO OUR PRIMAL STATE: NAKEDNESS; A SUSPICION OF IRONY STRIPS US OF THAT TRUMPERY HOPE WHICH LET US DUPE OURSELVES AND DEVISE ILLUSION: EVERY CONTRARY PATH LEADS OUTSIDE OF LIFE. ENNUI IS MERELY THE BEGINNING OF SUCH AN ITINERARY. . . . IT MAKES US FIND TIME LONG, TOO LONG—UNSUITED TO SHOW US AN END. DETACHED FROM EVERY OBJECT, HAVING NOTHING EXTERNAL TO ASSIMILATE, WE DESTROY OURSELVES IN SLOW MOTION, SINCE THE FUTURE HAS STOPPED OFFERING US A RAISON D'ÊTRE.

ENNUI SHOWS US AN ETERNITY WHICH IS NOT THE TRANSCENDENCE OF TIME, BUT ITS WRECK; IT IS THE INFINITY OF SOULS THAT HAVE ROTTED FOR LACK OF SUPERSTITIONS, A BANAL ABSOLUTE WHERE NOTHING ANY LONGER KEEPS THINGS FROM TURNING IN CIRCLES, IN SEARCH OF THEIR OWN FALL.

LIFE CREATES ITSELF IN DELIRIUM AND IS UNDONE IN ENNUI.

(THE MAN SUFFERING FROM A CHARACTERIZED SICKNESS IS NOT ENTITLED TO COMPLAIN: HE HAS AN OCCUPATION. THE GREAT SUFFERERS ARE NEVER BORED: DISEASE FILLS THEM, THE WAY REMORSE FEEDS THE GREAT CRIMINALS. FOR ANY INTENSE SUFFERING PRODUCES A SIMULACRUM OF PLENITUDE AND PROPOSES A TERRIBLE REALITY TO CONSCIOUSNESS, WHICH IT CANNOT ELUDE; WHILE SUFFERING WITHOUT SUBSTANCE IN THAT TEMPORAL MOURNING OF ENNUI AFFORDS CONSCIOUSNESS NOTHING THAT FORCES IT TO FRUITFUL ACTION. HOW TO CURE AN UNLOCALIZED AND SUPREMELY IMPALPABLE DISEASE WHICH INFECTS THE BODY WITHOUT LEAVING ANY TRACE UPON IT, WHICH INSINUATES ITSELF INTO THE SOUL WITHOUT MARKING IT BY ANY SIGN? ENNUI IS LIKE A SICKNESS WE HAVE SURVIVED, BUT ONE WHICH HAS ABSORBED OUR POSSIBILITIES, OUR RESERVES OF ATTENTION AND HAS LEFT US IMPOTENT TO FILL THE VOID WHICH FOLLOWS UPON THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OUR PANGS AND THE FADING OF OUR TORMENTS. HELL IS A HAVEN NEXT TO THIS DISPLACEMENT IN TIME, THIS EMPTY AND PROSTRATE LANGUOR IN WHICH NOTHING STOPS US BUT THE SPECTACLE OF THE UNIVERSE DECAYING BEFORE OUR EYES.

WHAT THERAPEUTICS TO INVOKE AGAINST A DISEASE WE NO LONGER REMEMBER AND WHOSE AFTERMATH ENCROACHES UPON OUR DAYS? HOW INVENT A REMEDY FOR EXISTENCE, HOW CONCLUDE THIS ENDLESS CURE? AND HOW RECOVER FROM YOUR OWN BIRTH?

ENNUI, THAT INCURABLE CONVALESCENCE . . .)

MAGNIFICENT FUTILITY
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE GREEK SKEPTICS AND THE ROMAN EMPERORS OF THE DECADENCE, ALL MINDS SEEM ENSLAVED BY A MUNICIPAL VOCATION. ONLY THESE TWO GROUPS ARE EMANCIPATED, THE FORMER BY DOUBT, THE LATTER BY DEMENTIA, FROM THE INSIPID OBSESSION OF BEING USEFUL. HAVING PROMOTED THE ARBITRARY TO THE RANK OF DRILL OR DELIRIUM, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY WERE PHILOSOPHERS OR DISABUSED SCIONS OF THE OLD CONQUERORS, THEY WERE ATTACHED TO NOTHING: IN THIS REGARD, THEY SUGGEST THE SAINTS. BUT WHILE THE SAINTS WERE NEVER TO COLLAPSE, THESE OTHERS FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE MERCY OF THEIR OWN GAME, MASTERS AND VICTIMS OF THEIR WHIMS—TRUE SOLITARIES, SINCE THEIR SOLITUDE WAS STERILE. NO ONE HAS FOLLOWED THEIR EXAMPLE AND THEY THEMSELVES PROPOSED NO SUCH THING; HENCE THEY COMMUNICATED WITH THEIR “KIND” ONLY BY IRONY AND TERROR. . .

TO BE THE DISSOLVENT OF A PHILOSOPHY OR OF AN EMPIRE: WHAT PRIDE COULD BE MORE MELANCHOLY AND MORE MAJESTIC? TO KILL, ON THE ONE HAND, TRUTH, AND GREATNESS ON THE OTHER, MANIAS WHICH NOURISH THE MIND AND THE CITY; TO UNDERMINE THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FACADES PROTECTING THE THINKER’S PRIDE AND THE CITIZEN’S; TO FLEX TO THE POINT OF FRACTURING THE SPRINGS OF THEIR IMPULSE TO CONCEIVE AND TO WILL; TO DISCREDIT, BY THE SUBTLETIES OF SARCASM AND TORTURE, BOTH TRADITIONAL ABSTRACTIONS AND HONORABLE CUSTOMS—WHAT DELICATE AND BRUTAL EFFERVESCENCE! NOTHING BEGUILES WHERE THE GODS DIE BEFORE OUR EYES. IN ROME, WHERE THEY WERE REPLACED, IMPORTED, WHERE THEY COULD BE SEEN TO WITHER, WHAT PLEASURE TO INVOKE GHOSTS WITH YET THE ONE FEAR THAT THIS SUBLIME VERSATILITY MIGHT CAPITULATE TO THE ASSAULT OF SOME SEVERE AND IMPURE DEITY . . . WHICH IS WHAT HAPPENED.

IT IS NOT EASY TO DESTROY AN IDOL: IT TAKES AS MUCH TIME AS IS REQUIRED TO PROMOTE AND TO WORSHIP ONE. FOR IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO ANNIHILATE ITS MATERIAL SYMBOL, WHICH IS EASY; BUT ITS ROOTS IN THE SOUL. HOW TURN YOUR EYES TOWARD THE TWILIGHT AGES—WHEN THE PAST WAS LIQUIDATED UNDER A SCRUTINY WHICH ONLY THE VOID COULD DAZZLE—WITHOUT BEING MOVED BY THAT GREAT ART WHICH IS THE DEATH OF A CIVILIZATION?

. . . AND SO I DREAM OF HAVING BEEN ONE OF THOSE SLAVES, COMING FROM AN IMPROBABLE COUNTRY, BARBAROUS AND BROODING, TO LANGUISH IN THE AGONY OF ROME, MY VAGUE DESOLATION EMBELLISHED BY GREEK SOPHISTRIES. IN THE VACANT EYES OF THE STATUES, IN THE IDOLS SHRUNKEN BY SAGGING SUPERSTITIONS, I SHOULD HAVE FORGOTTEN ALL ABOUT MY ANCESTORS, MY YOKES, AND MY REGRETS. ESPOUSING THE MELANCHOLY OF THE ANCIENT SYMBOLS, I SHOULD HAVE LIBERATED MYSELF; I SHOULD HAVE SHARED THE DIGNITY OF THE ABANDONED GODS, DEFENDING THEM AGAINST THE INSIDIOUS CROSSES, AGAINST THE INVASION OF SERVANTS AND MARTYRS, AND MY NIGHTS WOULD HAVE SOUGHT THEIR REST IN THE DELIRIUM AND DEBAUCHERY OF THE CAESARS. EXPERT IN DISILLUSIONS, RIDDLING THE NEW FERVORS WITH ALL THE ARROWS OF A DISSOLUTE WISDOM—AMONG THE COURTESANS, IN SKEPTICAL BROTHELS OR CIRCUSES WITH THEIR SUMPTUOUS CRUELTIES, I SHOULD HAVE SWELLED MY REASONINGS WITH VICE AND WITH BLOOD, DILATING LOGIC TO DIMENSIONS IT HAD NEVER DREAMED OF, TO THE DIMENSIONS OF WORLDS THAT DIE.

EXEGESIS OF FAILURE
EACH OF US IS BORN WITH A SHARE OF PURITY, PREDESTINED TO BE CORRUPTED BY OUR COMMERCE WITH MANKIND, BY THAT SIN AGAINST SOLITUDE. FOR EACH OF US WILL DO ANYTHING IN ORDER NOT TO BE DOOMED TO HIMSELF. OUR KIND IS NOT A FATALITY BUT THE TEMPTATION TO FAIL. INCAPABLE OF KEEPING OUR HANDS CLEAN AND OUR HEARTS UNDILUTED, WE SOIL OURSELVES UPON CONTACT WITH STRANGE SWEATS, WE WALLOW—CRAVING FOR DISGUST AND FERVENT FOR PESTILENCE—IN THE UNANIMOUS MUD. AND WHEN WE DREAM OF SEAS CHANGED INTO HOLY WATER, IT IS TOO LATE TO DIVE INTO THEM, AND OUR ADVANCED STATE OF CORRUPTION KEEPS US FROM DROWNING THERE: THE WORLD HAS INFESTED OUR SOLITUDE; UPON US THE TRACES OF OTHERS BECOME INDELIBLE.

IN THE GAMUT OF CREATURES, ONLY MAN INSPIRES A SUSTAINED DISGUST. THE REPUGNANCE WHICH AN ANIMAL BEGETS IS PROVISIONAL; IT NEVER RIPENS IN THOUGHT, WHEREAS OUR KIND OBSESSES OUR REFLECTIONS, INFILTRATES THE MECHANISM OF OUR DETACHMENT FROM THE WORLD IN ORDER TO CONFIRM US IN OUR SYSTEM OF REFUSAL AND NON-ADHERENCE. AFTER EACH CONVERSATION, WHOSE REFINEMENT ALONE IS ENOUGH TO INDICATE THE LEVEL OF A CIVILIZATION, WHY IS IT IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO REGRET THE SAHARA AND NOT TO ENVY THE PLANTS OR THE ENDLESS MONOLOGUES OF ZOOLOGY?

IF WITH EACH WORD WE WIN A VICTORY OVER NOTHINGNESS, IT IS ONLY THE BETTER TO ENDURE ITS REIGN. WE DIE IN PROPORTION TO THE WORDS WHICH WE FLING AROUND US . . . THOSE WHO SPEAK HAVE NO SECRETS. AND WE ALL SPEAK. WE BETRAY OURSELVES, WE EXHIBIT OUR HEART; EXECUTIONER OF THE UNSPEAKABLE, EACH OF US LABORS TO DESTROY ALL THE MYSTERIES, BEGINNING WITH OUR OWN. AND IF WE MEET OTHERS, IT IS TO DEGRADE OURSELVES TOGETHER IN A RACE TO THE VOID, WHETHER IN THE EXCHANGE OF IDEAS, SCHEMES, OR CONFESSIONS. CURIOSITY HAS PROVOKED NOT ONLY THE FIRST FALL BUT THE COUNTLESS ONES OF EVERY DAY OF OUR LIVES. LIFE IS ONLY THAT IMPATIENCE TO FALL, TO FAIL, TO PROSTITUTE THE SOUL’S VIRGINAL SOLITUDES BY DIALOGUE, AGELESS AND EVERYDAY NEGATION OF PARADISE. MAN SHOULD LISTEN ONLY TO HIMSELF IN THE ENDLESS ECSTASY OF THE INTRANSMISSIBLE WORD, SHOULD CREATE WORDS FOR HIS OWN SILENCES AND ASSENTS AUDIBLE ONLY TO HIS REGRETS. BUT HE IS THE CHATTERBOX OF THE UNIVERSE; HE SPEAKS IN THE NAME OF OTHERS; HIS SELF LOVES THE PLURAL. AND ANYONE WHO SPEAKS IN THE NAME OF OTHERS IS ALWAYS AN IMPOSTOR. POLITICIANS, REFORMERS, AND ALL WHO RELY ON A COLLECTIVE PRETEXT ARE CHEATS. THERE IS ONLY THE ARTIST WHOSE LIE IS NOT A TOTAL ONE, FOR HE INVENTS ONLY HIMSELF. OUTSIDE OF THE SURRENDER TO THE INCOMMUNICABLE, THE SUSPENSION AMID OUR MUTE AND UNCONSOLED ANXIETIES, LIFE IS MERELY A FRACAS ON AN UNMAPPED TERRAIN, AND THE UNIVERSE A GEOMETRY STRICKEN WITH EPILEPSY.

(THE IMPLICIT PLURAL OF “ONE” AND THE AVOWED PLURAL OF “WE” CONSTITUTE THE COMFORTABLE REFUGE OF FALSE EXISTENCE. ONLY THE POET TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR “I,” HE ALONE SPEAKS IN HIS OWN NAME, HE ALONE IS ENTITLED TO DO SO. POETRY IS BASTARDIZED WHEN IT BECOMES PERMEABLE TO PROPHECY OR TO DOCTRINE: “MISSION” SMOTHERS MUSIC, IDEA SHACKLES INSPIRATION. SHELLY’S “GENEROUS” ASPECT CRIPPLES MOST OF HIS WORK; SHAKESPEARE, BY A STROKE OF LUCK, NEVER “SERVED” ANYTHING.

THE VICTORY OF NON-AUTHENTICITY IS FULFILLED IN PHILOSOPHICAL ACTIVITY, THAT COMPLACENCE IN “ONE,” AND IN PROPHETIC ACTIVITY [WHETHER RELIGIOUS, MORAL, OR POLITICAL], THAT APOTHEOSIS OF “WE.” DEFINITION IS THE LIE OF THE ABSTRACT MIND; INSPIRED FORMULA THE LIE OF THE MILITANT ONE; A DEFINITION IS ALWAYS THE CORNERSTONE OF A TEMPLE; A FORMULA INESCAPABLY MUSTERS THE FAITHFUL. THUS ALL TEACHINGS BEGIN.

HOW THEN FAIL TO TURN TO POETRY? IT HAS, LIKE LIFE, THE EXCUSE OF PROVING NOTHING.)

COALITION AGAINST DEATH
HOW IMAGINE OTHER PEOPLE’S LIVES, WHEN OUR OWN SEEMS SCARCELY CONCEIVABLE? WE MEET SOMEONE, WE SEE HIM PLUNGED INTO AN IMPENETRABLE AND UNJUSTIFIABLE WORLD, IN A MASS OF DESIRES AND CONVICTIONS SUPERIMPOSED ON REALITY LIKE A MORBID STRUCTURE. HAVING MADE A SYSTEM OF MISTAKES FOR HIMSELF, HE SUFFERS FOR REASONS WHOSE NULLITY ALARMS THE MIND AND SURRENDERS HIMSELF TO VALUES WHOSE ABSURDITY LEAPS TO THE EYE. WHAT ARE HIS UNDERTAKINGS BUT TRIFLES, AND IS THE FEVERISH SYMMETRY OF HIS CONCERNS ANY BETTER BUILT THAN AN ARCHITECTURE OF TWADDLE? TO THE OUTSIDE OBSERVER, THE ABSOLUTE OF EACH LIFE LOOKS INTERCHANGEABLE, AND EVERY FATE, HOWEVER FIXED IN ITS ESSENCE, ARBITRARY. WHEN OUR CONVICTIONS SEEM THE FRUIT OF A FRIVOLOUS LUNACY, HOW TOLERATE OTHER PEOPLE’S PASSIONS FOR THEMSELVES AND FOR THEIR OWN MULTIPLICATION IN EACH DAY’S UTOPIA? BY WHAT NECESSITY DOES THIS MAN SHUT HIMSELF UP IN A PARTICULAR WORLD OF PREDILECTIONS, AND THAT MAN IN ANOTHER?

WHEN WE ENDURE THE CONFIDENCES OF A FRIEND OR A STRANGER, THE REVELATION OF HIS SECRETS FILLS US WITH ASTONISHMENT. ARE WE TO RELATE HIS TORMENTS TO DRAMA OR TO FARCE? THIS DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON THE GOOD WILL OR THE EXASPERATIONS OF OUR LASSITUDE. EACH FATE BEING NO MORE THAN A REFRAIN FLUTTERING AROUND A FEW BLOODSTAINS, IT IS UP TO OUR MOODS TO SEE IN THE DISPOSITION OF SUCH SUFFERINGS A SUPERFLUOUS AND PIQUANT ORDER, OR A PRETEXT FOR PITY.

SINCE IT IS DIFFICULT TO APPROVE THE REASONS PEOPLE INVOKE, EACH TIME WE LEAVE ONE OF OUR FELLOW MEN, THE QUESTION WHICH COMES TO MIND IS INVARIABLY THE SAME: HOW DOES HE KEEP FROM KILLING HIMSELF? FOR NOTHING IS MORE NATURAL THAN TO IMAGINE OTHER PEOPLE’S SUICIDE. WHEN WE HAVE GLIMPSED, BY AN OVERWHELMING AND READILY RENEWABLE INTUITION, ANYONE’S OWN USELESSNESS, IT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT EVERYONE HAS NOT DONE THE SAME. TO DO AWAY WITH ONESELF SEEMS SUCH A CLEAR AND SIMPLE ACTION! WHY IS IT SO RARE, WHY DOES EVERYONE AVOID IT? BECAUSE, IF REASON DISAVOWS THE APPETITE FOR LIFE, THE NOTHING WHICH EXTENDS OUR ACTS IS NONETHELESS OF A POWER SUPERIOR TO ALL ABSOLUTES; IT EXPLAINS THE TACIT COALITION OF MORTALS AGAINST DEATH; IT IS NOT ONLY THE SYMBOL OF EXISTENCE, BUT EXISTENCE ITSELF; IT IS EVERYTHING. AND THIS NOTHING, THIS EVERYTHING, CANNOT GIVE LIFE A MEANING, BUT IT NONETHELESS MAKES LIFE PERSEVERE IN WHAT IT IS: A STATE OF NON-SUICIDE.

SUPREMACY OF THE ADJECTIVE
SINCE THERE CAN BE ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF WAYS TO FACE THE ULTIMATE PROBLEMS, THE MIND IS LIMITED IN ITS EXPANSION BY THAT NATURAL BOUNDARY WHICH IS THE ESSENTIAL, BY THAT IMPOSSIBILITY OF INDEFINITELY MULTIPLYING THE CAPITAL DIFFICULTIES: HISTORY IS SOLELY CONCERNED WITH CHANGING THE ASPECT OF A SUM OF QUESTIONS AND SOLUTIONS. WHAT THE MIND INVENTS IS MERELY A SERIES OF NEW QUALIFICATIONS; IT REBAPTIZES THE ELEMENTS OR SEEKS IN ITS LEXICONS LESS ERODED EPITHETS FOR THE ONE IMMUTABLE PAIN. WE HAVE ALWAYS SUFFERED, BUT OUR SUFFERING HAS BEEN EITHER “SUBLIME” OR “LEGITIMATE” OR “ABSURD,” ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL VIEWS WHICH THE PHILOSOPHIC MOMENT MAINTAINED. MISERY CONSTITUTES THE TEXTURE OF ALL THAT BREATHES; BUT ITS MODALITIES HAVE CHANGED COURSE; THEY HAVE COMPOSED THAT SERIES OF IRREDUCIBLE APPEARANCES WHICH LEAD EACH OF US TO BELIEVE HE IS THE FIRST TO HAVE SUFFERED SO. THE PRIDE OF SUCH UNIQUENESS INCITES US TO CHERISH OUR OWN PAIN AND TO ENDURE IT. IN A WORLD OF SUFFERINGS, EACH OF THEM IS A SOLIPSIST IN RELATION TO ALL THE REST. MISERY’S ORIGINALITY IS DUE TO THE VERBAL QUALITY WHICH ISOLATES IT IN THE SUM OF WORDS AND SENSATIONS. . . .

THE QUALIFIERS CHANGE: THIS CHANGE IS CALLED INTELLECTUAL PROGRESS. SUPPRESS THEM ALL AND WHAT WOULD REMAIN OF CIVILIZATION? THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTELLIGENCE AND STUPIDITY RESIDES IN THE MANIPULATION OF THE ADJECTIVE, WHOSE USE WITHOUT DIVERSITY CONSTITUTES BANALITY. GOD HIMSELF LIVES ONLY BY THE ADJECTIVES WE ADD TO HIM; WHEREBY THE RAISON D'ETRE OF THEOLOGY. HENCE MAN, BY MODULATING THE MONOTONY OF HIS MISERY EVER VARIOUSLY, JUSTIFIES HIMSELF TO THE MIND ONLY BY THE IMPASSIONED SEARCH FOR A NEW ADJECTIVE.

(AND YET THIS SEARCH IS PITIABLE. THE POVERTY OF EXPRESSION WHICH IS THE MIND’S POVERTY, IS MANIFEST IN THE INDIGENCE OF WORDS, IN THEIR EXHAUSTION AND THEIR DEGRADATION: THE ATTRIBUTES BY WHICH WE DETERMINE THINGS AND SENSATIONS FINALLY LIE BEFORE US LIKE SO MUCH VERBAL CARRION. AND WE GLANCE REGRETFULLY AT THE TIME WHEN THEY GAVE OFF NO MORE THAN AN ODOR OF CONFINEMENT. ALL ALEXANDRIANISM BEGINS WITH THE NEED TO VENTILATE WORDS, TO MAKE UP FOR THEIR BLEMISHES BY A LIVELY REFINEMENT; BUT IT ENDS IN A LASSITUDE IN WHICH MIND AND WORD ARE MINGLED AND DECOMPOSE. [IDEALLY, THE FINAL STAGE OF A LITERATURE AND OF A CIVILIZATION: IMAGINE A VALÉRY WITH THE SOUL OF A NERO. . . .]

SO LONG AS OUR UNTRIED SENSES AND OUR NAIVE HEART RECOGNIZE THEMSELVES AND DELIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE OF QUALIFICATIONS, THEY FLOURISH WITH THE AID AND AT THE RISK OF THE ADJECTIVE, WHICH, ONCE DISSECTED, PROVES INADEQUATE, DEFICIENT. WE SAY OF SPACE, OF TIME, AND OF SUFFERING THAT THEY ARE INFINITE; BUT INFINITE HAS NO MORE BEARING THAN BEAUTIFUL, SUBLIME, HARMONIOUS, UGLY. . . . SUPPOSE WE FORCE OURSELVES TO SEE TO THE BOTTOM OF WORDS? WE SEE NOTHING—EACH OF THEM, DETACHED FROM THE EXPANSIVE AND FERTILE SOUL, BEING NULL AND VOID. THE POWER OF THE INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS BY PROJECTING A CERTAIN LUSTER UPON THEM, BY POLISHING THEM AND MAKING THEM GLITTER; THIS POWER, ERECTED INTO A SYSTEM, IS CALLED CULTURE—PYROTECHNICS AGAINST A NIGHT SKY OF NOTHINGNESS.)

THE DEVIL REASSURED
WHY IS GOD SO DULL, SO FEEBLE, SO INADEQUATELY PICTURESQUE? WHY DOES HE LACK INTEREST, VIGOR, ACTUALITY AND RESEMBLE US SO LITTLE? IS THERE ANY IMAGE LESS ANTHROPOMORPHIC AND MORE GRATUITOUSLY REMOTE? HOW COULD WE HAVE PROJECTED INTO HIM LIGHTS SO DIM AND POWERS SO UNSTEADY? WHERE HAVE OUR ENERGEIS LEAKED AWAY TO, WHERE HAVE OUR DESIRES RUN OUT? WHO THEN HAS ABSORBED OUR OVERFLOW OF VITAL INSOLENCE?

SHALL WE TURN TO THE DEVIL? BUT WE CANNOT ADDRESS OUR PRAYERS TO HIM: TO WORSHIP HIM WOULD BE TO PRAY IRRESPECTIVELY, TO PRAY TO OURSELVES. WE DO NOT PRAY TO WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE: THE EXACT IS NOT AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP. WE HAVE PLACED IN OUR DOUBLE ALL OUR ATTRIBUTES, AND, IN ORDER TO AFFORD HIM A SEMBLANCE OF SOLEMNITY, WE HAVE DRESSED HIM IN BLACK: OUR VICES AND OUR VIRTUES IN MOURNING. BY ENDOWING HIM WITH WICKEDNESS AND PERSEVERANCE OUR DOMINANT QUALITIES, WE HAVE EXHAUSTED OURSELVES TO MAKE HIM AS LIVELY AS POSSIBLE; OUR POWERS HAVE BEEN USED UP IN CREATING HIS IMAGE, IN MAKING HIM AGILE, FRISKY, INTELLIGENT, IRONIC, AND ABOVE ALL PETTY. THE RESERVES OF ENERGY WE STILL HAD LEFT TO PRODUCE GOD WERE REDUCED TO NOTHING. THEN WE RESORTED TO THE IMAGINATION AND TO WHAT LITTLE BLOOD WE HAD LEFT: GOD COULD BE ONLY THE FRUIT OF OUR ANEMIA: A TOTTERING AND RACHITIC IMAGE. HE IS MILD, GOOD, SUBLIME, JUST. BUT WHO RECOGNIZES HIMSELF IN THAT MIXTURE REDOLENT OF ROSE WATER, RELEGATED TO TRANSCENDENCE? A BEING WITHOUT DUPLICITY LACKS DEPTH, LACKS MYSTERY; HE HIDES NOTHING. ONLY IMPURITY IS A SIGN OF REALITY. AND IF THE SAINTS ARE NOT COMPLETELY STRIPPED OF INTEREST, IT IS BECAUSE THEIR SUBLIMITY IS TINGED WITH THE NOVELISTIC, THEIR ETERNITY LENDS ITSELF TO BIOGRAPHY; THEIR LIVES INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE LEFT THE WORLD FOR A GENRE CAPABLE OF CAPTIVATING US FROM TIME TO TIME. . . .

BECAUSE HE OVERFLOWS WITH LIFE, THE DEVIL HAS NO ALTAR: MAN RECOGNIZES HIMSELF TOO READILY IN HIM TO WORSHIP HIM; HE DETESTS HIM FOR GOOD REASON; HE REPUDIATES HIMSELF, AND MAINTAINS THE INDIGENT ATTRIBUTES OF GOD. BUT THE DEVIL NEVER COMPLAINS AND NEVER ASPIRES TO FOUND A RELIGION: ARE WE NOT HERE TO SAFEGUARD HIM FROM INANITION AND OBLIVION?

PROMENADE AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE
WITHIN THE CIRCLE WHICH ENCLOSES HUMAN BEINGS IN A COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS AND HOPES, THE MIND OPPOSED TO MIRAGES CLEARS A PATH FROM THE CENTER TOWARD THE PERIPHERY. IT CAN NO LONGER HEAR AT CLOSE RANGE THE HUM OF HUMANITY; IT WANTS TO CONSIDER FROM AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE THE ACCURSED SYMMETRY WHICH LINKS MEN TOGETHER. IT SEES MARTYRS EVERYWHERE: SOME SACRIFICING THEMSELVES FOR VISIBLE NEEDS, OTHERS FOR INESTIMABLE NECESSITIES, ALL READY TO BURY THEIR NAMES UNDER A CERTITUDE; AND, SINCE NOT ALL OF THEM CAN SUCCEED, THE MAJORITY EXPIATE BY BANALITY THE OVERFLOW OF BLOOD THEY HAVE DREAMED OF . . . THEIR LIVES CONSIST OF AN ENORMOUS FREEDOM TO DIE WHICH THEY HAVE NOT TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF: INEXPRESSIVE HOLOCAUST OF HISTORY, THE BONEYARD SWALLOWS THEM UP.

BUT THE ENTHUSIAST OF SEPARATIONS, SEEKING PATHS UNHAUNTED BY THE HORDES, WITHDRAWS TO THE EXTREME MARGIN AND FOLLOWS THE RIM OF THE CIRCLE, WHICH HE CANNOT CROSS SO LONG AS HE IS SUBJECT TO THE BODY; YET CONSCIOUSNESS SOARS FARTHER, QUITE PURE IN AN ENNUI WITHOUT BEINGS OR OBJECTS. NO LONGER SUFFERING, SUPERIOR TO THE EXCUSES WHICH INVITE DYING, CONSCIOUSNESS FORGETS THE MAN WHO SUPPORTS IT. MORE UNREAL THAN A STAR GLIMPSED IN SOME HALLUCINATION, IT SUGGESTS THE CONDITION OF A SIDEREAL PIROUETTE—WHILE ON LIFE’S CIRCUMFERENCE THE SOUL PROMENADES, MEETING ONLY ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN, ITSELF AND ITS IMPOTENCE TO ANSWER THE CALL OF THE VOID.

THE SUNDAYS OF LIFE
IF SUNDAY AFTERNOONS WERE EXTENDED FOR MONTHS, WHERE WOULD HUMANITY GET TO, LIBERATED FROM SWEAT, FROM THE WEIGHT OF THE FIRST CURSE? THE EXPERIMENT WOULD BE WORTH THE TROUBLE. IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT CRIME WOULD BECOME THE SOLE DIVERSION, THAT DEBAUCHERY WOULD SEEM CANDOR, SHOUTING MELODY AND JEERS TENDERNESS. THE SENSATION OF TIME’S IMMENSITY WOULD MAKE EACH SECOND INTO AN INTOLERABLE TORMENT, A SUBLIME FIRING SQUAD. IN HEARTS IMBUED WITH POETRY WOULD APPEAR A BLASÉ CANNIBALISM AND A HYENA’S MELANCHOLY; BUTCHERS AND EXECUTIONERS WOULD DIE OUT—OF LETHARGY; CHURCHES AND BROTHELS WOULD SPLIT WITH SIGHS. THE UNIVERSE TRANSFORMED INTO A SUNDAY AFTERNOON . . . IT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF ENNUI, AND THE END OF THE UNIVERSE. . . . TAKE AWAY THE CURSE HANGING OVER HISTORY AND IT IMMEDIATELY VANISHES, LIKE EXISTENCE ITSELF, IN ABSOLUTE VACANCY, EXPOSING ITS FICTION. LABOR BUILDS ON NOTHINGNESS, CREATES AND CONSOLIDATES MYTHS; ELEMENTARY INTOXICATION, IT EXCITES AND MAINTAINS THE BELIEF IN “REALITY"; BUT CONTEMPLATION OF PURE EXISTENCE, CONTEMPLATION INDEPENDENT OF ACTIONS AND OBJECTS, ASSIMILATES ONLY WHAT IS NOT. . . .

THE IDLE APPREHEND MORE THINGS, ARE DEEPER THAN THE INDUSTRIOUS: NO TASK LIMITS THEIR HORIZON; BORN INTO AN ETERNAL SUNDAY, THEY WATCH-—AND WATCH THEMSELVES WATCHING. SLOTH IS A SOMATIC SKEPTICISM, THE WAY THE FLESH DOUBTS. IN A WORLD OF INACTION, THE IDLE WOULD BE THE ONLY ONES NOT TO BE MURDERERS. BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO HUMANITY, AND, SWEAT NOT BEING THEIR STRONG POINT, THEY LIVE WITHOUT SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES OF LIFE AND OF SIN. DOING NEITHER GOOD NOR EVIL, THEY DISDAIN—SPECTATORS OF THE HUMAN CONVULSION—THE WEEKS OF TIME, THE EFFORTS WHICH ASPHYXIATE CONSCIOUSNESS. WHAT WOULD THEY HAVE TO FEAR FROM A LIMITLESS EXTENSION OF CERTAIN AFTERNOONS EXCEPT THE REGRET OF HAVING SUPPORTED A CRUDELY ELEMENTARY OBVIOUSNESS? THEN, EXASPERATION IN THE TRUTH MIGHT INDUCE THEM TO IMITATE THE OTHERS AND TO INDULGE IN THE DEGRADING TEMPTATION OF TASKS. THIS IS THE DANGER WHICH THREATENS SLOTH, THAT MIRACULOUS RESIDUE OF PARADISE.

(LOVE’S ONE FUNCTION IS TO HELP US ENDURE THOSE CRUEL AND INCOMMENSURABLE SUNDAY AFTERNOONS WHICH TORMENT US FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK—AND FOR ETERNITY.

WITHOUT THE ALLUREMENT OF THE ANCESTRAL SPASM, WE SHOULD REQUIRE A THOUSAND EYES FOR HIDDEN TEARS, OR ELSE NAILS TO BITE, MILE-LONG NAILS. . . . HOW ELSE KILL THIS TIME WHICH NO LONGER PASSES? ON THOSE INTERMINABLE SUNDAYS THE DISEASE OF BEING IS UTTERLY PLAIN. SOMETIMES WE MANAGE TO FORGET OURSELVES IN SOMETHING; BUT HOW FORGET OURSELVES IN THE WORLD ITSELF? THIS IMPOSSIBILITY IS THE DEFINITION OF THE DISEASE. THE MAN WHO IS AFFLICTED BY IT WILL NEVER BE CURED, EVEN IF THE UNIVERSE CHANGED ALTOGETHER. ONLY HIS HEART SHOULD CHANGE, BUT IT IS UNCHANGEABLE; HENCE FOR HIM, TO EXIST HAS ONLY ONE MEANING: TO DIVE INTO SUFFERING—UNTIL THE EXERCISE OF A DAY-BY-DAY NIRVANIZATION RAISES HIM TO THE PERCEPTION OF UNREALITY. . . .)

RESIGNATION
IT WAS IN A CLINIC WAITING ROOM: AN OLD WOMAN WAS TELLING ME ABOUT HER DISEASES. . . . THE CONTROVERSIES OF MEN, THE HURRICANES OF HISTORY—IN HER EYES, TRIFLES: HER SICKNESS ALONE PREVAILED OVER TIME AND SPACE. “1 CAN’T EAT, I CAN’T SLEEP, I’M AFRAID, THERE MUST BE SOME PUS HERE . . .” SHE BEGAN CARESSING HER JAW WITH MORE INTEREST THAN IF THE FATE OF THE WORLD DEPENDED ON IT. AT FIRST THIS EXCESS OF SELF-CONCERN ON THE PART OF A DECREPIT CRONE LEFT ME TORN BETWEEN DREAD AND DISGUST; THEN I LEFT THE CLINIC BEFORE IT WAS MY TURN, DETERMINED TO RENOUNCE MY DISCOMFORTS FOREVER. . . .

“FIFTY-NINE SECONDS OUT OF EACH OF MY MINUTES,” I REFLECTED AS I WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS, “WERE DEDICATED TO SUFFERING OR TO . . . THE IDEA OF SUFFERING. IF ONLY I HAD A STONE’S VOCATION! A HEART: ORIGIN OF EVERY TORMENT. . . I ASPIRE TO THE OBJECT, TO THE BLESSING OF MATTER AND OPACITY. THE ZIGZAGGING OF A GNAT SEEMS TO ME AN APOCALYPTIC ENTERPRISE. IT IS A SIN TO GET OUTSIDE YOURSELF. . . THE WIND—AIR’S INSANITY! MUSIC, THE MADNESS OF SILENCE! BY CAPITULATING TO LIFE, THIS WORLD HAS BETRAYED NOTHINGNESS. . . . I RESIGN FROM MOVEMENT, AND FROM MY DREAMS. ABSENCE! YOU SHALL BE MY SOLE GLORY. . . . LET “DESIRE” BE FOREVER STRICKEN FROM THE DICTIONARY, AND FROM THE SOUL! I RETREAT BEFORE THE DIZZYING FARCE OF TOMORROWS. AND IF I STILL CLING TO A FEW HOPES, I HAVE LOST FOREVER THE FACULTY OF HOPING™

THE INDIRECT ANIMAL
WHAT A DOWNFALL, WHEN YOU BEAR IN MIND, BY SOME RADICAL OBSESSION, THAT MAN EXISTS, THAT HE IS WHAT HE IS—AND THAT HE CANNOT BE OTHERWISE. BUT WHAT HE IS A THOUSAND DEFINITIONS EXPOSE AND NONE COMPELS RECOGNITION: THE MORE ARBITRARY THEY ARE, THE MORE VALID THEY SEEM. THE AIRIEST ABSURDITY AND THE WEIGHTIEST BANALITY ARE EQUALLY APPROPRIATE. THE INFINITY OF HIS ATTRIBUTES COMPOSES THE MOST IMPRECISE BEING WE CAN CONCEIVE. WHEREAS THE ANIMALS PROCEED DIRECTLY TO THEIR GOAL, MAN LOSES HIMSELF IN DETOURS; HE IS THE INDIRECT ANIMAL PAR EXCELLENCE. HIS IMPROBABLE REFLEXES—FROM WHOSE SLACKENING CONSCIOUSNESS DERIVES—TRANSFORM MM INTO A CONVALESCENT ASPIRING TO DISEASE. NOTHING IN HIM IS HEALTHY EXCEPT THE FACT OF HAVING BEEN SO. WHETHER HE IS AN ANGEL THAT HAS LOST HIS WINGS OR AN APE THAT HAS LOST HIS HAIR, HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEAVE THE ANONYMITY OF CREATURES ONLY BY THE ECLIPSES OF HIS HEALTH. HIS POORLY CONSTITUTED BLOOD HAS ALLOWED THE INFILTRATION OF UNCERTAINTIES, APPROXIMATIONS, PROBLEMS; HIS WAVERING VITALITY, THE INTRUSION OF QUESTION MARKS AND EXCLAMATION POINTS. HOW DEFINE THE VIRUS WHICH, ERODING HIS SOMNOLENCE, HAS STUNNED HIM WITH INSOMNIA AMONG THE UNIVERSAL SIESTA? WHAT WORM HAS BURROWED INTO HIS REPOSE, WHAT PRIMAL AGENT OF KNOWLEDGE HAS FORCED HIM TO THE BACKWARDNESS OF ACTIONS, THE ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT OF DESIRES? WHO HAS INTRODUCED THE FIRST LANGUOR INTO HIS FEROCITY? EMERGING FROM THE THRONG OF THE OTHER LIVING CREATURES, HE HAS CREATED A SUBTLER CONFUSION FOR HIMSELF; HE HAS SCRUPULOUSLY EXPLOITED THE ILLS OF A LIFE WRESTED FROM ITSELF OUT OF ALL HE HAS UNDERTAKEN TO BE HEALED OF HIMSELF, A STRANGER DISEASE HAS BEEN CONSTITUTED:, HIS “CIVILIZATION” IS MERELY THE EFFORT TO FIND REMEDIES FOR AN INCURABLE—AND COVETED—STATE. THE MIND WILTS AT THE APPROACH OF HEALTH: MAN IS AN INVALID—OR HE IS NOTHING. WHEN, HAVING THOUGHT OF EVERYTHING, HE THINKS OF HIMSELF—FOR HE MANAGES THIS ONLY BY THE DETOUR OF THE UNIVERSE, AS IF HE WERE THE LAST PROBLEM HE PROPOSES TO HIMSELF—HE REMAINS ASTONISHED, CONFUSED, EMBARRASSED. BUT HE CONTINUES TO PREFER, TO THE NATURE WHICH ETERNALLY CAPSIZES INTO HEALTH, HIS OWN DEFEAT.

(SINCE ADAM MEN’S ENTIRE EFFORT HAS BEEN TO MODIFY MAN. THE AIMS OF REFORM AND OF PEDAGOGY, ARTICULATED AT THE EXPENSE OF IRREDUCIBLE DATA, DENATURE THOUGHT AND DISTORT ITS MOVEMENT. KNOWLEDGE HAS NO MORE DESPERATE ENEMY THAN THE EDUCATIVE INSTINCT, AT ONCE OPTIMISTIC AND VIRULENT, WHICH NO PHILOSOPHER CAN ESCAPE: HOW WOULD THEIR SYSTEMS BE UNSCATHED BY IT? OUTSIDE THE IRREMEDIABLE, EVERYTHING IS FALSE; FALSE THIS CIVILIZATION WHICH SEEKS TO COMBAT IT, FALSE THE TRUTHS WITH WHICH IT ARMS ITSELF.

EXCEPT FOR THE ANCIENT SKEPTICS AND THE FRENCH MORALISTS, IT WOULD BE HARD TO CITE A SINGLE MIND WHOSE THEORIES, SECRETLY OR EXPLICITLY, DO NOT TEND TO MOLD MAN. BUT HE SUBSISTS UNCHANGED, THOUGH HE HAS FOLLOWED THE PARADE OF NOBLE PRECEPTS, PROPOSED TO HIS CURIOSITY, OFFERED TO HIS ARDOR AND TO HIS UNCERTAINTY. WHEREAS ALL BEINGS HAVE THEIR PLACE IN NATURE, MAN REMAINS A METAPHYSICALLY STRAYING CREATURE, LOST IN LIFE, A STRANGER TO THE CREATION. NO ONE HAS FOUND A VALID GOAL FOR HISTORY; BUT EVERYONE HAS PROPOSED ONE; AND IN THE PULLULATION OF GOALS SO DIVERGENT AND SO FANTASTIC, THE NOTION OF FINALITY HAS BEEN CANCELED OUT AND VANISHES INTO A MOCKING CLAUSE OF THE MIND.

EACH OF US TAKES ON HIMSELF THAT UNIT OF DISASTER WHICH IS THE PHENOMENON MAN. AND THE ONLY MEANING TIME HAS IS TO MULTIPLY THESE UNITS, ENDLESSLY TO ENLARGE THESE VERTICAL SUFFERINGS WHICH DEPEND UPON A NONENTITY OF MATTER, UPON THE PRIDE OF A GIVEN NAME, AND UPON A SOLITUDE WITHOUT APPEAL.)

THE KEY TO OUR ENDURANCE
THE MAN WHO MANAGED, BY AN IMAGINATION OVERFLOWING WITH PITY, TO RECORD ALL THE SUFFERINGS, TO BE CONTEMPORARY WITH ALL THE PAIN AND ALL THE ANGUISH OF ANY GIVEN MOMENT—SUCH A MAN—SUPPOSING HE COULD EVER EXIST—WOULD BE A MONSTER OF LOVE AND THE GREATEST VICTIM IN THE HISTORY OF THE HUMAN HEART. BUT IT IS FUTILE TO IMAGINE SUCH AN IMPOSSIBILITY. WE NEED MERELY PROCEED TO AN INVESTIGATION OF OURSELVES, ONLY UNDERTAKE THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF OUR ALARMS. IF WE VENTURE INTO THE TORMENT OF THE DAYS, IT IS BECAUSE NOTHING HALTS THIS MARCH EXCEPT OUR PANGS; THOSE OF OTHERS SEEM TO US EXPLICABLE AND CAPABLE OF BEING TRANSCENDED: WE BELIEVE THEY SUFFER BECAUSE THEY LACK SUFFICIENT WILL, COURAGE, OR LUCIDITY. EACH SUFFERING, EXCEPT OURS, SEEMS TO US LEGITIMATE OR ABSURDLY INTELLIGIBLE; OTHERWISE, MOURNING WOULD BE THE UNIQUE CONSTANT IN THE VERSATILITY OF OUR SENTIMENTS. BUT WE WEAR ONLY THE MOURNING OF OURSELVES. IF WE COULD UNDERSTAND AND LOVE THE INFINITY OF AGONIES WHICH LANGUISH AROUND US, ALL THE LIVES WHICH ARE HIDDEN DEATHS, WE SHOULD REQUIRE AS MANY HEARTS AS THERE ARE SUFFERING BEINGS. AND IF WE HAD A MIRACULOUSLY PRESENT MEMORY WHICH SUSTAINED THE TOTALITY OF OUR PAST PAINS, WE SHOULD SUCCUMB BENEATH SUCH A BURDEN. LIFE IS POSSIBLE ONLY BY THE DEFICIENCIES OF OUR IMAGINATION AND OUR MEMORY.

WE DERIVE OUR POWER FROM OUR FORGETTING AND FROM OUR INCAPACITY TO CONCEIVE OF THE PLURALITY OF SIMULTANEOUS FATES. NO ONE COULD SURVIVE THE INSTANTANEOUS COMPREHENSION OF UNIVERSAL GRIEF, EACH HEART BEING STIRRED ONLY FOR A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF SUFFERINGS. THERE ARE SOMETHING LIKE MATERIAL LIMITS TO OUR ENDURANCE; YET THE EXPANSION OF EACH PANG REACHES AND OCCASIONALLY EXCEEDS SUCH LIMITS: THIS IS TOO OFTEN THE SOURCE OF OUR RUIN. WHEREUPON THE IMPRESSION THAT EACH MISERY, EACH DISAPPOINTMENT IS INFINITE. INDEED THEY ARE, BUT ONLY FOR US, FOR THE LIMITS OF OUR OWN HEART; AND IF THE LATTER HAD THE DIMENSIONS OF SPACE ITSELF, OUR ILLS WOULD BE MORE SPACIOUS STILL, SINCE EVERY PAIN REPLACES THE WORLD, AND FOR EACH UNHAPPINESS WE REQUIRE ANOTHER UNIVERSE. REASON VAINLY STRIVES TO SHOW US THE INFINITESIMAL PROPORTIONS OF OUR DISASTERS; IT FAILS, CONFRONTED WITH OUR PENCHANT FOR COSMOGONIC PROLIFERATION. THUS TRUE MADNESS IS NEVER DUE TO CHANCE OR TO THE DISASTERS OF THE BRAIN, BUT TO THE FALSE CONCEPTION OF SPACE THE HEART CREATES FOR ITSELF. . . .

ANNIHILATION BY DELIVERANCE
A DOCTRINE OF SALVATION HAS MEANING ONLY IF WE START FROM THE EQUATION “EXISTENCE EQUALS SUFFERING.” IT IS NEITHER A SUDDEN REALIZATION, NOR A SERIES OF REASONINGS WHICH LEAD US TO THIS EQUATION, BUT THE UNCONSCIOUS ELABORATION OF OUR EVERY MOMENT, THE CONTRIBUTION OF ALL OUR EXPERIENCES, MINUTE OR CRUCIAL. WHEN WE CARRY GERMS OF DISAPPOINTMENTS AND A KIND OF THIRST TO SEE THEM DEVELOP, THE DESIRE THAT THE WORLD SHOULD UNDERMINE OUR HOPES AT EACH STEP MULTIPLIES THE VOLUPTUOUS VERIFICATIONS OF THE DISEASE. THE ARGUMENTS COME LATER; THE DOCTRINE IS CONSTRUCTED: THERE STILL REMAINS ONLY THE DANGER OF “WISDOM.” BUT, SUPPOSE WE DO NOT WANT TO BE FREE OF SUFFERING NOR TO CONQUER OUR CONTRADICTIONS AND CONFLICTS—WHAT IF WE PREFER THE NUANCES OF THE INCOMPLETE AND AN AFFECTIVE DIALECTIC TO THE EVENNESS OF A SUBLIME IMPASSE? SALVATION ENDS EVERYTHING; AND ENDS US. WHO, ONCE SAVED, DARES STILL CALL HIMSELF ALIVE? WE REALLY LIVE ONLY BY THE REFUSAL TO BE DELIVERED FROM SUFFERING AND BY A KIND OF RELIGIOUS TEMPTATION OF IRRELIGIOSITY. SALVATION HAUNTS ONLY ASSASSINS AND SAINTS, THOSE WHO HAVE KILLED OR TRANSCENDED THE CREATURE; THE REST WALLOW—DEAD DRUNK—IN IMPERFECTION. . . . THE MISTAKE OF EVERY DOCTRINE OF DELIVERANCE IS TO SUPPRESS POETRY, CLIMATE OF THE INCOMPLETE. THE POET WOULD BETRAY HIMSELF IF HE ASPIRED TO BE SAVED: SALVATION IS THE DEATH OF SONG, THE NEGATION OF ART AND OF THE MIND. HOW TO FEEL INTEGRAL WITH A CONCLUSION? WE CAN REFINE, WE CAN FARM OUR SUFFERINGS, BUT BY WHAT MEANS CAN WE FREE OURSELVES FROM THEM WITHOUT SUSPENDING OURSELVES? DOCILE TO MALEDICTION, WE EXIST ONLY INSOFAR AS WE SUFFER. A SOUL ENLARGES AND PERISHES ONLY BY AS MUCH INSUPPORTABLE AS IT ASSUMES.

THE ABSTRACT VENOM
EVEN OUR VAGUE ILLS, OUR DIFFUSE ANXIETIES, DEGENERATING INTO PHYSIOLOGY, SHOULD BY A CONVERSE IMPULSE BE RESTORED TO THE MANEUVERS OF THE INTELLIGENCE. IF WE RAISED ENNUI—TAUTOLOGICAL PERCEPTION OF THE WORLD, THE DULL RIPPLE OF DURATION—TO THE DIGNITY OF A DEDUCTIVE ELEGY, IF WE OFFERED IT THE TEMPTATION OF A GLAMOROUS STERILITY? WITHOUT RESORTING TO AN ORDER SUPERIOR TO THE SOUL, THE SOUL COLLAPSES INTO THE FLESH—AND PHYSIOLOGY BECOMES THE LAST WORD OF OUR PHILOSOPHIC STUPORS. TO TRANSPOSE IMMEDIATE POISONS INTO INTELLECTUAL CURRENCY, TO MAKE AN INSTRUMENT OUT OF OUR PALPABLE CORRUPTION, OR ELSE TO MASK THE IMPURITY OF EVERY SENTIMENT AND SENSATION BY NORMS IS A PURSUIT OF ELEGANCE NECESSARY TO THE MIND, NEXT TO WHICH THE SOUL—THAT PATHETIC HYENA—IS MERELY PROFOUND AND SINISTER. THE MIND IN ITSELF CAN BE ONLY SUPERFICIAL, ITS NATURE BEING UNIQUELY CONCERNED WITH THE ARRANGEMENT OF CONCEPTUAL EVENTS AND NOT WITH THEIR IMPLICATIONS IN THE SPHERES THEY SIGNIFY. OUR STATES INTEREST IT ONLY INSOFAR AS THEY ARE TRANSPOSABLE. THUS MELANCHOLIA EMANATES FROM OUR VISCERA AND JOINS THE COSMIC VOID; BUT THE MIND ADOPTS MELANCHOLIA ONLY FILTERED OF WHAT ATTACHES IT TO THE FRAGILITY OF THE SENSES; THE MIND INTERPRETS IT; REFINED, MELANCHOLIA BECOMES POINT OF VIEW: DEPARTMENTAL MELANCHOLIA. THEORY LIES IN WAIT AND SEIZES UPON OUR VENOMS, AND RENDERS THEM LESS NOXIOUS. IT IS A DEGRADATION FROM ABOVE, THE MIND-AS-AMATEUR OF PURE INTOXICATIONS—SINCE IT IS THE ENEMY OF INTENSITIES.

THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISERY
EVERYTHING CONSPIRES, ELEMENTS AND ACTIONS ALIKE, TO HARM YOU. ARM YOURSELF IN DISDAIN, ISOLATE YOURSELF IN A FORTRESS OF DISGUST, DREAM OF SUPERHUMAN INDIFFERENCE? THE ECHOES OF TIME WOULD PERSECUTE YOU IN YOUR ULTIMATE ABSENCES. . . . WHEN NOTHING CAN KEEP YOU FROM BLEEDING, IDEAS THEMSELVES TURN RED OR ENCROACH ON EACH OTHER LIKE TUMORS. THERE IS NO SPECIFIC IN OUR PHARMACIES AGAINST EXISTENCE; NOTHING BUT MINOR REMEDIES FOR BRAGGARTS. BUT WHERE IS THE ANTIDOTE FOR LUCID DESPAIR, PERFECTLY ARTICULATED, PROUD, AND SURE? ALL OF US ARE MISERABLE, BUT HOW MANY KNOW IT? THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISERY IS TOO SERIOUS A DISEASE TO FIGURE IN AN ARITHMETIC OF AGONIES OR IN THE CATALOGUES OF THE INCURABLE. IT BELITTLES THE PRESTIGE OF HELL, AND CONVERTS THE SLAUGHTERHOUSES OF TIME INTO IDYLS. WHAT SIN HAVE YOU COMMITTED TO BE BORN, WHAT CRIME TO EXIST? YOUR SUFFERING LIKE YOUR FATE IS WITHOUT MOTIVE. TO SUFFER, TRULY TO SUFFER, IS TO ACCEPT THE INVASION OF ILLS WITHOUT THE EXCUSE OF CAUSALITY, AS A FAVOR OF DEMENTED NATURE, AS A NEGATIVE MIRACLE. . . .

IN TIME’S SENTENCE MEN TAKE THEIR PLACE LIKE COMMAS, WHILE, IN ORDER TO END IT, YOU HAVE IMMOBILIZED YOURSELF INTO A PERIOD.

INTERJECTIVE THOUGHT
THE IDEA OF INFINITY MUST HAVE BEEN BORN ON A DAY OF SLACKENING WHEN SOME VAGUE LANGUOR INFILTRATED INTO GEOMETRY, LIKE THE FIRST ACT OF KNOWLEDGE AT THE MOMENT WHEN, IN THE SILENCE OF REFLEXES, A MACABRE SHUDDER ISOLATED THE PERCEPTION OF ITS OBJECT. HOW MANY DISGUSTS OR NOSTALGIAS HAVE WE HAD TO ACCUMULATE IN ORDER TO WAKEN AT THE END ALONE, TRAGICALLY SUPERIOR TO THE EVIDENCE! A FORGOTTEN SIGH HAS MADE US TAKE A STEP OUTSIDE THE IMMEDIATE; A BANAL FATIGUE HAS ALIENATED US FROM A LANDSCAPE OR A PERSON; DIFFUSE MOANS HAVE SEPARATED US FROM SWEET OR TIMID INNOCENCES. THE SUM OF THESE ACCIDENTAL DISTANCES CONSTITUTES—LEDGER OF OUR DAYS AND NIGHTS—THE GAP WHICH DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE WORLD, AND WHICH THE MIND STRIVES TO REDUCE AND TO RESTORE TO OUR FRAGILE PROPORTIONS. BUT THE CREATION OF EACH LASSITUDE MAKES ITSELF FELT: WHERE NOW TO SEEK FOR THE SUBSTANCE UNDER OUR STEPS?

AT FIRST, IT IS IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THINGS THAT WE THINK; THEN, WHEN WE HAVE GONE TOO FAR, IN ORDER TO LOSE OURSELVES IN THE REGRET FOR OUR ESCAPE. . . . AND SO OUR CONCEPTS ARE LINKED TOGETHER LIKE DISSIMULATED SIGHS, EVERY REFLECTION REPLACES AN INTERJECTION, A PLAINTIVE TONALITY SUBMERGES THE DIGNITY OF LOGIC. FUNEREAL HUES DIM OUR IDEAS, HINTS OF THE GRAVEYARD ENCUMBER OUR PARAGRAPHS: A WHIFF OF MILDEW IN OUR PRECEPTS, THE LAST DAY OF AUTUMN IN A TIMELESS CRYSTAL. . . . THE MIND IS DEFENSELESS AGAINST THE MIASMAS WHICH ASSAIL IT, FOR THEY RISE FROM THE MOST CORRUPT PLACE THAT EXISTS BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN, FROM THE PLACE WHERE MADNESS LIES DOWN IN TENDERNESS, CLOACA OF UTOPIAS AND DEN OF DREAMS: OUR SOUL AND EVEN THEN WHEN WE COULD CHANGE THE LAWS OF THE UNIVERSE OR FORESEE ITS WHIMS, OUR SOUL WOULD SUBJUGATE US BY ITS MISERIES, BY THE PRINCIPLE OF ITS RUIN. A SOUL WHICH IS NOT LOST? WHERE IS SUCH A THING, SO THAT WE MAY DRAW UP THE INTERROGATION, SO THAT SCIENCE, SANCTITY, AND COMEDY MAY SEIZE UPON IT!

APOTHEOSIS OF THE VAGUE
WE MIGHT APPREHEND THE ESSENCE OF NATIONS—EVEN MORE THAN THAT OF INDIVIDUALS—-BY THEIR WAY OF PARTICIPATING IN THE VAGUE. THE SPECIFICS IN WHICH THEY LIVE REVEAL ONLY THEIR TRANSITORY CHARACTER, THEIR PERIPHERIES, THEIR APPEARANCES.

WHAT A NATION CAN EXPRESS HAS ONLY A HISTORICAL VALUE: ITS SUCCESS IN BECOMING; BUT WHAT IT CANNOT EXPRESS, ITS FAILURE IN THE ETERNAL, IS THE UNPRODUCTIVE THIRST FOR ITSELF: ITS EFFORT TO EXHAUST ITSELF IN EXPRESSION BEING STRICKEN WITH IMPOTENCE, IT FILLS THE GAP BY CERTAIN WORDS—ALLUSIONS TO THE UNSPEAKABLE. . . .

HOW MANY TIMES, IN OUR PEREGRINATIONS OUTSIDE THE INTELLECT, HAVE WE NOT RESTED OUR TROUBLES IN THE SHADE OF THOSE SEHNSUCHTS, YEARNINGS, SAUDADES, THOSE SONOROUS FRUITS GROWN FOR OVERRIPE HEARTS!

LIFT THE VEIL FROM THESE WORDS: DO THEY CONCEAL THE SAME CONTENT? IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE SAME MEANING LIVES AND DIES IN THE VERBAL RAMIFICATIONS OF AN IDENTICAL STOCK? IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT SUCH DIVERSE PEOPLES EXPERIENCE NOSTALGIA IN THE SAME WAY?

THE MAN WHO STRUGGLES TO FIND THE FORMULA FOR THE DISEASE OF THE DISTANT BECOMES THE VICTIM OF A RICKETY ARCHITECTURE. TO GET BACK TO THE SOURCE OF THESE EXPRESSIONS OF THE VAGUE, WE MUST MAKE AN AFFECTIVE REGRESSION TOWARD THEIR ESSENCE, MUST DROWN IN THE INEFFABLE AND EMERGE FROM IT WITH OUR CONCEPTS IN TATTERS. ONCE OUR THEORETICAL ASSURANCE AND OUR PRIDE IN THE INTELLIGIBLE IS LOST, WE CAN TRY TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING FOR ITSELF THEN WE MANAGE TO REJOICE IN THE INEXPRESSIBLE, TO SPEND OUR DAYS IN THE MARGIN OF THE COMPREHENSIBLE, AND TO WALLOW IN THE SUBURBS OF THE SUBLIME. IN ORDER TO ESCAPE STERILITY, WE MUST WEAR REASON’S MOURNING. . . .

TO LIVE IN EXPECTATION, IN WHAT IS NOT YET, IS TO ACCEPT THE STIMULATING DISEQUILIBRIUM IMPLIED BY THE VERY NOTION OF FUTURE. EVERY NOSTALGIA IS A TRANSCENDENCE OF THE PRESENT. EVEN IN THE FORM OF REGRET, IT ASSUMES A DYNAMIC CHARACTER: WE WANT TO FORCE THE PAST, WE WANT TO ACT RETROACTIVELY, TO PROTEST AGAINST THE IRREVERSIBLE. LIFE HAS A CONTENT ONLY IN THE VIOLATION OF TIME. THE OBSESSION OF ELSEWHERE IS THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF THE MOMENT; AND THIS IMPOSSIBILITY IS NOSTALGIA ITSELF.

THAT THE FRENCH SHOULD HAVE REFUSED TO FEEL AND ABOVE ALL TO CULTIVATE THE IMPERFECTION OF THE INDEFINITE IS CERTAINLY SUGGESTIVE. IN A COLLECTIVE FORM, THIS DISEASE DOES NOT EXIST IN FRANCE: WHAT THE FRENCH CALL CAFARD HAS NO METAPHYSICAL QUALITY AND ENNUI IS MANAGED ANGULARLY. THE FRENCH REPEL ALL COMPLACENCY TOWARD THE POSSIBLE; THEIR LANGUAGE ITSELF ELIMINATES ANY COMPLICITY WITH ITS DANGERS. IS THERE ANY OTHER NATION WHICH FINDS ITSELF MORE AT EASE IN THE WORLD, FOR WHICH BEING CHEZ SOI HAS MORE MEANING AND MORE WEIGHT, FOR WHICH IMMANENCE OFFERS MORE ATTRACTIONS?

IN ORDER TO DESIRE SOMETHING ELSE FUNDAMENTALLY, WE MUST BE STRIPPED OF SPACE AND TIME, WE MUST LIVE IN A MINIMUM OF RELATIONSHIP WITH A SITE, A MOMENT. THE REASON THE HISTORY OF FRANCE OFFERS SO FEW DISCONTINUITIES IS THAT FIDELITY TO ITS ESSENCE, WHICH FLATTERS OUR INCLINATION TO PERFECTION AND DISAPPOINTS THE CRAVING FOR THE INCOMPLETE WHICH A TRAGIC VISION IMPLIES. THE ONLY CONTAGIOUS THING IN FRANCE IS LUCIDITY, THE HORROR OF BEING FOOLED, OF BEING THE VICTIM OF ANYTHING. THIS IS WHY A FRENCHMAN ACCEPTS A RISK ONLY WHEN HE IS FULLY CONSCIOUS OF IT; HE WANTS TO BE FOOLED; HE BANDAGES HIS EYES; UNCONSCIOUS HEROISM RIGHTLY SEEMS TO HIM A LAPSE OF TASTE, AN INELEGANT SACRIFICE. BUT LIFE’S BRUTAL AMBIGUITY REQUIRES THE TRIUMPH OF THE IMPULSE AND NOT OF THE WILL, TO BE A CORPSE, TO BE METAPHYSICALLY FOOLED.

IF THE FRENCH HAVE BURDENED NOSTALGIA WITH TOO MUCH CLARITY, IF THEY HAVE STRIPPED IT OF A CERTAIN INTIMATE AND DANGEROUS GLAMOR, SEHNSUCHT, ON THE OTHER HAND, EXHAUSTS WHATEVER IS INSOLUBLE ABOUT IT IN THE CONFLICTS OF THE GERMAN SOUL, TORN BETWEEN HEIMAT AND INFINITY. 

HOW COULD IT FIND SATISFACTION? ON ONE SIDE, THE LONGING TO BE PLUNGED INTO THE UNDIFFERENTIATION OF HEART AND HEARTH; ON THE OTHER, TO KEEP ABSORBING SPACE IN AN UNSLAKED DESIRE. AND SINCE EXTENT OFFERS NO LIMITS, AND SINCE WITH IT GROWS THE PENCHANT FOR NEW WANDERINGS, THE GOAL RETREATS ACCORDING TO THE PROGRESS MADE. WHENCE THE EXOTIC TASTE, THE PASSION FOR JOURNEYS, THE DELECTATION IN LANDSCAPE AS LANDSCAPE, THE LACK OF INNER FORM, THE TORTUOUS DEPTH AT ONCE SEDUCTIVE AND DISHEARTENING. THERE IS NO SOLUTION TO THE TENSION BETWEEN HEIMAT AND INFINITY: FOR IT IS TO BE ROOTED AND UPROOTED AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME, AND TO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO FIND A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE FIRESIDE AND THE FAR-OFF . . . IMPERIALISM, DEADLY CONSTANT IN ITS ULTIMATE ESSENCE—WHAT IS IT BUT THE POLITICAL AND VULGARLY CONCRETE TRANSLATION OF SEHNSUCHT?

WE CANNOT OVEREMPHASIZE THE HISTORICAL CONSEQUENCES OF CERTAIN INNER APPROXIMATIONS. NOW, NOSTALGIA IS ONE OF THESE; IT KEEPS US FROM RESTING IN EXISTENCE OR IN THE ABSOLUTE; IT FORCES US TO DRIFT IN THE INDISTINCT, TO LOSE OUR FOUNDATIONS, TO LIVE UNCOVERED IN TIME.

TO BE TORN FROM THE EARTH, EXILED IN DURATION, CUT OFF FROM ONE’S IMMEDIATE ROOTS, IS TO LONG FOR A REINTEGRATION IN THE ORIGINAL SOURCES DATING FROM BEFORE THE SEPARATION AND THE SEVERANCE. NOSTALGIA IS PRECISELY TO FEEL ETERNALLY DISTANT FROM CHEZ SOT\ AND, OUTSIDE THE LUMINOUS PROPORTIONS OF ENNUI, AND OUTSIDE OF THE CONTRADICTORY POSTULATION OF HEIMAT AND INFINITY, IT TAKES THE FORM OF THE RETURN TO THE FINITE, TO THE IMMEDIATE, TO A TERRESTRIAL AND MATERNAL APPEAL. LIKE THE MIND, THE HEART CREATES UTOPIAS: AND OF THEM ALL, THE STRANGEST IS THE UTOPIA OF A NATAL UNIVERSE, WHERE WE REST FROM OURSELVES, A UNIVERSE THAT IS THE COSMIC PILLOW OF ALL OUR LASSITUDES.

IN NOSTALGIC ASPIRATION WE DO NOT WANT SOMETHING PALPABLE, BUT A KIND OF ABSTRACT WARMTH, HETEROGENEOUS TO TIME AND CLOSE TO A PARADISIAC PRESENTIMENT. WHATEVER DOES NOT ACCEPT EXISTENCE AS SUCH BORDERS ON THEOLOGY. NOSTALGIA IS MERELY A SENTIMENTAL THEOLOGY, IN WHICH THE ABSOLUTE IS BUILT WITH THE ELEMENTS OF DESIRE, IN WHICH GOD IS INDETERMINACY ELABORATED BY LANGUOR.

SOLITUDE—SCHISM OF THE HEART
WE ARE DOOMED TO PERDITION EACH TIME LIFE DOES NOT REVEAL ITSELF AS A MIRACLE, EACH TIME THE MOMENT NO LONGER MOANS IN A SUPERNATURAL SHUDDER. HOW RENEW THAT SENSATION OF PLENITUDE, THOSE SECONDS OF DELIRIUM, THOSE VOLCANIC FLASHES, THOSE WONDERS OF FERVOR WHICH REDUCE GOD TO AN ACCIDENT OF OUR CLAY? BY WHAT SUBTERFUGE REVIVE THAT EXPLOSION IN WHICH EVEN MUSIC SEEMS SUPERFICIAL, THE CASTOFF OF OUR INNER ORGAN?

IT IS NOT IN OUR POWER TO REMEMBER THE SEIZURES WHICH MADE US COINCIDE WITH THE START OF MOVEMENT, MADE US MASTERS OF THE FIRST MOMENT OF TIME AND INSTANTANEOUS ARTISANS OF THE CREATION. WE PERCEIVE NO MORE OF CREATION THAN ITS DESTITUTION, THE GRIM REALITY; WE LIVE IN ORDER TO UNLEARN ECSTASY. AND IT IS NOT THE MIRACLE WHICH DETERMINES OUR TRADITION AND OUR SUBSTANCE, BUT THE VOID OF A UNIVERSE FRUSTRATED OF ITS FLAMES, ENGULFED IN ITS OWN ABSENCES, EXCLUSIVE OBJECT OF OUR RUMINATION: A LONELY UNIVERSE BEFORE A LONELY HEART, EACH PREDESTINED TO DISJOIN AND TO EXASPERATE EACH OTHER IN THE ANTITHESIS. WHEN THE SOLITUDE IS INTENSIFIED TO THE POINT OF CONSTITUTING NOT SO MUCH OUR DATUM AS OUR SOLE FAITH, WE CEASE TO BE INTEGRAL WITH THE WHOLE: HERETICS OF EXISTENCE, WE ARE BANISHED FROM THE COMMUNITY OF THE LIVING, WHOSE SOLE VIRTUE IS TO WAIT, GASPING, FOR SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT DEATH. BUT WE, EMANCIPATED FROM THE FASCINATION OF SUCH WAITING, REJECTED FROM THE ECUMENICITY OF ILLUSION—WE ARE THE MOST HERETICAL SECT OF ALL, FOR OUR SOUL ITSELF IS BORN IN HERESY.

("WHEN THE SOUL IS IN A STATE OF GRACE, ITS BEAUTY IS SO HIGH AND SO ADMIRABLE THAT IT FAR SURPASSES ALL THAT IS BEAUTIFUL IN NATURE, AND DELIGHTS THE EYES OF GOD AND THE ANGELS”—IGNATIUS LOYOLA.

I HAVE SOUGHT TO SETTLE IN AN ORDINARY GRACE; I HAVE TRIED TO LIQUIDATE ALL INTERROGATIONS AND VANISH IN AN IGNORANT LIGHT, IN ANY LIGHT DISDAINFUL OF THE INTELLECT. BUT HOW ATTAIN TO THE SIGH OF FELICITY SUPERIOR TO PROBLEMS, WHEN NO “BEAUTY” ILLUMINATES YOU, AND WHEN GOD AND THE ANGELS ARE BLIND?

ONCE, WHEN TERESA, PATRON SAINT OF SPAIN AND OF YOUR SOUL, PRESCRIBED A COURSE OF TEMPTATIONS AND INTOXICATIONS, THE TRANSCENDENT ABYSS AMAZED YOU LIKE A FALL INTO THE HEAVENS. BUT THOSE HEAVENS HAVE VANISHED—LIKE THE TEMPTATIONS AND INTOXICATIONS—AND IN THE COLD HEART THE FEVERS OF AVILA ARE EXTINGUISHED FOREVER.

BY WHAT PECULIARITY OF FATE DO CERTAIN BEINGS, HAVING REACHED THE POINT WHERE THEY MIGHT COINCIDE WITH A FAITH, RETREAT TO FOLLOW A PATH WHICH LEADS THEM ONLY TO THEMSELVES—AND HENCE NOWHERE? IS IT OUT OF FEAR THAT ONCE INSTALLED IN GRACE THEY MIGHT LOSE THERE THEIR DISTINCT VIRTUES? EACH MAN DEVELOPS AT THE EXPENSE OF HIS DEPTHS, EACH MAN IS A MYSTIC WHO DENIES HIMSELF: THE EARTH IS INHABITED BY VARIOUS FORMS OF GRACE MANQUÉ, BY TRAMPLED MYSTERIES.)

TWILIGHT THINKERS
ATHENS WAS DYING, AND WITH IT THE WORSHIP OF KNOWLEDGE. THE GREAT SYSTEMS HAD RUN THEIR COURSE: LIMITED TO THE CONCEPTUAL REALM, THEY REJECTED THE INTERVENTION OF TORMENTS, THE PURSUIT OF DELIVERANCE AND OF INORDINATE MEDITATION UPON SUFFERING. THE DECLINING CITY, HAVING PERMITTED THE CONVERSION OF HUMAN DISASTERS INTO THEORY, NO MATTER WHAT—SNEEZE OR SUDDEN DEATH—WAS SUPPLANTING THE OLD PROBLEMS. THE OBSESSION WITH REMEDIES MARKS THE END OF A CIVILIZATION; THE SEARCH FOR SALVATION, THAT OF A PHILOSOPHY. PLATO AND ARISTOTLE HAD YIELDED TO SUCH PREOCCUPATIONS ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF EQUILIBRIUM; AFTER THEM, SUCH CONCERNS PREVAILED IN EVERY DOMAIN.

ROME, WANING, TOOK FROM ATHENS ONLY THE ECHOES OF ITS DECADENCE AND THE REFLECTIONS OF ITS COLLAPSE. WHEN THE GREEKS EXERCISED THEIR DOUBTS THROUGHOUT THE EMPIRE, THE LATTER’S DOWNFALL AND THAT OF PHILOSOPHY WERE VIRTUALLY CONSUMMATED. ALL QUESTIONS SEEMING LEGITIMATE, THE SUPERSTITION OF FORMAL LIMITS NO LONGER PREVENTED THE DEBAUCH OF ARBITRARY CURIOSITIES. THE INFILTRATION OF EPICUREANISM AND OF STOICISM WAS EASY: ETHICS REPLACED THE ABSTRACT STRUCTURES, BASTARDIZED REASON BECAME THE INSTRUMENT OF PRAXIS. IN THE STREETS OF ROME, WITH VARIOUS RECIPES FOR “HAPPINESS,” SWARMED THE EPICUREANS AND THE STOICS, EXPERTS IN WISDOM, NOBLE CHARLATANS APPEARING AT THE PERIPHERY OF PHILOSOPHY TO TREAT AN INCURABLE AND GENERALIZED LASSITUDE. BUT THEIR THERAPEUTICS LACKED THE MYTHOLOGY AND THE STRANGE ANECDOTES WHICH, IN THE UNIVERSAL ENERVATION, WERE TO CONSTITUTE THE VIGOR OF A RELIGION UNCONCERNED WITH NUANCE, A RELIGION ORIGINATING MORE REMOTELY THAN THEY. WISDOM IS THE LAST WORD OF AN EXPIRING CIVILIZATION, THE NIMBUS OF HISTORIC TWILIGHTS, FATIGUE TRANSFIGURED INTO A VISION OF THE WORLD, THE LAST TOLERANCE BEFORE THE ADVENT OF OTHER, NEWER GODS—AND OF BARBARISM; WISDOM, WHAT WE CALL SAGESSE, IS ALSO A VAIN ATTEMPT AT MELODY AMONG THE ENVIRONING DEATH RATTLES. FOR THE SAGE-—THEORETICIAN OF A LIMPID DEATH, HERO OF INDIFFERENCE, AND SYMBOL OF THE LAST STAGE OF PHILOSOPHY, OF ITS DEGENERESCENCE AND ITS VACUITY—HAS SOLVED THE PROBLEM OF HIS OWN DEATH . . . AND HAS THEREUPON SUPPRESSED ALL PROBLEMS. PROVIDED WITH RARER ABSURDITIES, HE IS A LIMIT-CASE, WHICH WE ENCOUNTER IN EXTREME PERIODS AS AN EXCEPTIONAL CONFIRMATION OF THE GENERAL PATHOLOGY.

FINDING OURSELVES AT A POINT SYMMETRICAL TO THE AGONY OF THE ANCIENT WORLD, A VICTIM OF THE SAME SICKNESSES AND UNDER SIMILARLY INELUCTABLE CHARMS, WE SEE THE GREAT SYSTEMS DESTROYED BY THEIR LIMITED PERFECTION. FOR US TOO, EVERYTHING BECOMES THE SUBSTANCE OF A PHILOSOPHY WITHOUT DIGNITY AND WITHOUT RIGOR. . . . THOUGHT’S IMPERSONAL FATE HAS BEEN SCATTERED INTO A THOUSAND SOULS, A THOUSAND HUMILIATIONS OF THE IDEA. . . . NOT LEIBNITZ, KANT, OR HEGEL ARE OF ANY HELP TO US ANY LONGER. WE HAVE COME WITH OUR OWN DEATH TO THE DOORS OF PHILOSOPHY: ROTTING ON THEIR HINGES, HAVING NOTHING MORE TO PROTECT, THEY OPEN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD . . . AND ANYTHING BECOMES A PHILOSOPHICAL SUBJECT. PARAGRAPHS ARE REPLACED BY CRIES: THE CONSEQUENCE IS A PHILOSOPHY OF THE FUNDUS ANIMAE, WHOSE INTIMACY WILL BE RECONNOITERED IN THE APPEARANCES OF HISTORY AND THE SURFACES OF TIME.

WE TOO SEEK “HAPPINESS,” EITHER BY FRENZY OR BY DISDAIN: TO SCORN IT IS NOT YET TO FORGET IT, AND TO REJECT IT IS A WAY OF RETAINING IT; WE TOO SEEK “SALVATION,” IF ONLY BY WANTING NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. AND IF WE ARE THE NEGATIVE HEROES OF AN OVERRIPE AGE, THEREBY WE ARE ITS CONTEMPORARIES: TO BETRAY ONE’S AGE OR TO BE ITS FERVENT ADEPT EXPRESSES—IN AN APPARENT CONTRADICTION—ONE AND THE SAME ACT OF PARTICIPATION. THE LOFTY DEFEATS, THE SUBTLE DECREPITUDES, THE ASPIRATIONS TO TIMELESS HALOS—ALL LEADING TO WISDOM—WHO WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE THEM IN HIMSELF? WHO DOES NOT FEEL THE RIGHT TO ASSERT EVERYTHING IN THE VOID AROUND HIM, BEFORE THE WORLD VANISHES IN THE DAWN OF AN ABSOLUTE OR OF A NEW NEGATION? A GOD IS ALWAYS THREATENING ON THE HORIZON. WE ARE IN THE MARGIN OF PHILOSOPHY, SINCE WE CONSENT TO ITS END. LET US CONDUCT OURSELVES SO THAT THE GOD DOES NOT SETTLE IN OUR THOUGHTS, LET US STILL KEEP OUR DOUBTS, THE APPEARANCES OF EQUILIBRIUM, AND THE TEMPTATION OF IMMANENT DESTINY, ANY ARBITRARY AND FANTASTIC ASPIRATION BEING PREFERABLE TO THE INFLEXIBLE TRUTHS. WE CHANGE CURES, FINDING NONE EFFECTIVE, NONE VALID, BECAUSE WE HAVE FAITH NEITHER IN THE PEACE WE SEEK NOR IN THE PLEASURES WE PURSUE. VERSATILE SAGES, WE ARE THE STOICS AND EPICUREANS OF MODERN ROMES. . . .

RESOURCES OF SELF-DESTRUCTION
BORN IN A PRISON, WITH BURDENS ON OUR SHOULDERS AND OUR THOUGHTS, WE COULD NOT REACH THE END OF A SINGLE DAY IF THE POSSIBILITIES OF ENDING IT ALL DID NOT INCITE US TO BEGIN THE NEXT DAY ALL OVER AGAIN. . . . IRONS AND THE UNBREATHABLE AIR OF THIS WORLD STRIP US OF EVERYTHING, EXCEPT THE FREEDOM TO KILL OURSELVES; AND THIS FREEDOM GRANTS US A STRENGTH AND A PRIDE TO TRIUMPH OVER THE LOADS WHICH OVERWHELM US.

WHAT GIFT IS MORE MYSTERIOUS THAN BEING ABLE TO DO WHAT WE WILL WITH OURSELVES AND TO REFUSE TO DO IT? CONSOLATION BY A POSSIBLE SUICIDE WIDENS INTO INFINITE SPACE THIS REALM WHERE WE ARE SUFFOCATING. THE NOTION OF DESTROYING OURSELVES, THE MULTIPLICITY OF MEANS FOR DOING SO, THEIR EASE AND THEIR PROXIMITY DELIGHT US AND FILL US WITH DREAD; FOR THERE IS NOTHING SIMPLER AND MORE TERRIBLE THAN THE ACTION BY WHICH WE DECIDE IRREVOCABLY UPON OURSELVES. IN A SINGLE SECOND WE DO AWAY WITH ALL SECONDS; GOD HIMSELF COULD NOT DO AS MUCH. BUT, BRAGGART DEMONS, WE POSTPONE OUR END: HOW COULD WE RENOUNCE THE DISPLAY OF OUR FREEDOM, THE SHOW OF OUR PRIDE? . . .

THE MAN WHO HAS NEVER IMAGINED HIS OWN ANNIHILATION, WHO HAS NOT ANTICIPATED RECOURSE TO THE ROPE, THE BULLET, POISON, OR THE SEA, IS A DEGRADED GALLEY SLAVE OR A WORM CRAWLING UPON THE COSMIC CARRION. THIS WORLD CAN TAKE EVERYTHING FROM US, CAN FORBID US EVERYTHING, BUT NO ONE HAS THE POWER TO KEEP US FROM WIPING OURSELVES OUT. EVERY TOOL OFFERS ITS HELP, EVERY ABYSS INVITES US IN; BUT ALL OUR INSTINCTS OPPOSE THE ACT. THIS CONTRADICTION DEVELOPS AN INSOLUBLE CONFLICT IN THE MIND. WHEN WE BEGIN TO REFLECT UPON LIFE, TO DISCOVER IN IT AN INFINITY OF EMPTINESS, OUR INSTINCTS HAVE ALREADY TURNED THEMSELVES INTO GUIDES AND MIDDLEMEN OF OUR ACTS; THEY REIN IN THE FLIGHT OF OUR INSPIRATION AND THE PLIABILITY OF OUR DETACHMENT. IF, AT THE MOMENT OF OUR BIRTH, WE WERE AS CONSCIOUS AS WE ARE AT THE END OF ADOLESCENCE, IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT AT THE AGE OF FIVE SUICIDE WOULD BE A HABITUAL PHENOMENON OR EVEN A QUESTION OF HONOR. BUT WE WAKE TOO LATE: WE HAVE AGAINST US THE YEARS NOURISHED SOLELY BY THE PRESENCE OF THE INSTINCTS, WHICH CAN BE ONLY STUPEFIED BY THE CONCLUSIONS TO WHICH OUR MEDITATIONS AND OUR DISAPPOINTMENTS LEAD. AND THEY REACT; YET, HAVING ACQUIRED THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF OUR FREEDOM, WE ARE MASTERS OF A RESOLVE ALL THE MORE TEMPTING IN THAT WE DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT. IT MAKES US ENDURE THE DAYS AND, WHAT IS MORE, THE NIGHTS; WE ARE NO LONGER POOR, OR CRUSHED BY ADVERSITY: WE POSSESS SUPREME RESOURCES. AND EVEN WHEN WE NEVER EXPLOIT THEM, WHEN WE EXPIRE IN THE USUAL WAY, WE HAVE HAD A TREASURE IN OUR VERY ABANDONMENTS: WHAT GREATER WEALTH THAN THE SUICIDE EACH OF US BEARS WITHIN HIMSELF?

IF THE RELIGIONS HAVE FORBIDDEN US TO DIE BY OUR OWN HAND, IT IS BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT SUCH PRACTICES SET AN EXAMPLE OF INSUBORDINATION WHICH HUMILIATED TEMPLES AND GODS ALIKE. THE COUNCIL OF ORLEANS REGARDED SUICIDE AS A SIN MORE GRIEVOUS THAN MURDER, FOR THE MURDERER CAN ALWAYS REPENT, BE SAVED, WHEREAS THE MAN WHO HAS TAKEN HIS OWN LIFE HAS PASSED BEYOND THE LIMITS OF SALVATION. BUT THE ACT OF SUICIDE ORIGINATES IN A RADICAL FORMULA OF SALVATION. IS NOT NOTHINGNESS THE EQUAL OF ETERNITY? THE SOLITARY BEING HAS NO NEED TO DECLARE WAR ON THE UNIVERSE—HE SENDS THE ULTIMATUM TO HIMSELF. HE NO LONGER ASPIRES TO BE FOREVER, IF IN AN INCOMPARABLE ACTION HE HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY HIMSELF. HE REJECTS HEAVEN AND EARTH AS HE REJECTS HIMSELF. AT LEAST HE WILL HAVE ACHIEVED A PLENITUDE OF FREEDOM INACCESSIBLE TO THE MAN WHO KEEPS LOOKING FOR IT IN THE FUTURE. . . .

NO CHURCH, NO CIVIL INSTITUTION HAS AS YET INVENTED A SINGLE ARGUMENT VALID AGAINST SUICIDE. WHAT ANSWER IS THERE TO THE MAN WHO CAN NO LONGER ENDURE LIFE? NO ONE IS QUALIFIED TO TAKE ANOTHER’S BURDENS UPON HIMSELF. AND WHAT POWER DOES DIALECTIC HAVE AGAINST THE ASSAULT OF IRREFUTABLE DESPAIRS AND AGAINST A THOUSAND UNCONSOLED MANIFESTATIONS? SUICIDE IS ONE OF MAN’S DISTINCTIVE CHARACTERISTICS, ONE OF HIS DISCOVERIES; NO ANIMAL IS CAPABLE OF IT, AND THE ANGELS HAVE SCARCELY GUESSED ITS EXISTENCE; WITHOUT IT, HUMAN REALITY WOULD BE LESS CURIOUS, LESS PICTURESQUE: WE SHOULD LACK A STRANGE CLIMATE AND A SERIES OF DEADLY POSSIBILITIES WHICH HAVE THEIR AESTHETIC VALUE, IF ONLY TO INTRODUCE INTO TRAGEDY CERTAIN NEW SOLUTIONS AND A VARIETY OF DENOUEMENTS.

THE SAGES OF ANTIQUITY, WHO PUT THEMSELVES TO DEATH AS A PROOF OF THEIR MATURITY, HAD CREATED A DISCIPLINE OF SUICIDE WHICH THE MODERNS HAVE UNLEARNED. DOOMED TO AN UNINSPIRED AGONY, WE ARE NEITHER AUTHORS OF OUR EXTREMITIES NOR ARBITERS OF OUR ADIEUX; THE END IS NO LONGER OUR END: WE LACK THE EXCELLENCE OF A UNIQUE INITIATIVE—BY WHICH WE MIGHT RANSOM AN INSIPID AND TALENTLESS LIFE, AS WE LACK THE SUBLIME CYNICISM, THE ANCIENT SPLENDOR OF AN ART OF DYING. HABITUES OF DESPAIR, COMPLACENT CORPSES, WE ALL OUTLIVE OURSELVES AND DIE ONLY TO FULFILL A FUTILE FORMALITY. IT IS AS IF OUR LIFE WERE ATTACHED TO ITSELF ONLY TO POSTPONE THE MOMENT WHEN WE COULD GET RID OF IT.

THE REACTIONARY ANGELS
IT IS DIFFICULT TO SIT IN JUDGMENT ON THE REVOLT OF THE LEAST PHILOSOPHICAL OF THE ANGELS WITHOUT A TINGE OF SYMPATHY, AMAZEMENT, AND . . . BLAME. INJUSTICE GOVERNS THE UNIVERSE. EVERYTHING WHICH IS DONE AND UNDONE THERE BEARS THE STAMP OF A FILTHY FRAGILITY, AS IF MATTER WERE THE FRUIT OF A SCANDAL AT THE CORE OF NOTHINGNESS. EACH BEING FEEDS ON THE AGONY OF SOME OTHER; THE MOMENTS RUSH LIKE VAMPIRES UPON TIME’S ANEMIA; THE WORLD IS A RECEPTACLE OF SOBS. . . . IN THIS SLAUGHTERHOUSE, TO FOLD ONE’S ARMS OR TO DRAW ONE’S SWORD ARE EQUALLY VAIN GESTURES. NO PROUD FRENZY CAN SHAKE SPACE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS OR ENNOBLE MEN’S SOULS. TRIUMPHS AND FAILURES FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER ACCORDING TO AN UNKNOWN LAW NAMED DESTINY, A NAME TO WHICH WE RESORT WHEN, PHILOSOPHICALLY UNPROVIDED FOR, OUR SOJOURN HERE ON EARTH OR ANYWHERE SEEMS INSOLUBLE TO US, A KIND OF CURSE TO ENDURE, SENSELESS AND UNDESERVED. DESTINY—FAVORITE WORD IN THE VOCABULARY OF THE VANQUISHED. . . . GREEDY FOR A NOMENCLATURE OF THE IRREMEDIABLE, WE SEEK RELIEF IN VERBAL INVENTION, IN LIGHTS SUSPENDED OVER OUR DISASTERS. WORDS ARE CHARITABLE: THEIR FRAIL REALITY DECEIVES AND CONSOLES US. . . .

THUS “DESTINY,” WHICH CAN WILL NOTHING, IS WHAT HAS WILLED WHAT HAPPENS TO US. . . . INFATUATED WITH THE IRRATIONAL AS THE SOLE MODE OF EXPLANATION, WE WATCH IT TIP THE SCALE OF OUR FATE, WHICH WEIGHS ONLY NEGATIVE ELEMENTS. WHERE FIND THE PRIDE TO PROVOKE THE FORCES WHICH HAVE SO DECREED, AND WHAT IS MORE, ARE NOT TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS DECREE? AGAINST WHOM WAGE THE STRUGGLE, AND WHERE LEAD THE ASSAULT WHEN INJUSTICE HAUNTS THE AIR OF OUR LUNGS, THE SPACE OF OUR THOUGHTS, THE SILENCE AND THE STUPOR OF THE STARS? OUR REVOLT IS AS ILL CONCEIVED AS THE WORLD WHICH PROVOKES IT. HOW TAKE IT ON OURSELVES TO RIGHT WRONGS WHEN, LIKE DON QUIXOTE ON HIS DEATHBED, WE HAVE LOST—MADNESS AT ITS END, EXHAUSTED—VIGOR AND ILLUSION TO CONFRONT THE HIGHROADS, COMBATS, AND DEFEATS? AND HOW REGAIN THE ENERGY OF THAT SEDITIOUS ANGEL WHO, STILL AT TIME’S START, KNEW NOTHING OF THAT PESTILENTIAL WISDOM IN WHICH OUR IMPULSES ASPHYXIATE? WHERE FIND ENOUGH VERVE AND PRESUMPTION TO STIGMATIZE THE HERD OF THE OTHER ANGELS, WHILE HERE ON EARTH TO FOLLOW THEIR COLLEAGUE IS TO CAST ONESELF STILL LOWER, WHILE MEN’S INJUSTICE IMITATES GOD’S, AND ALL REBELLION SETS THE SOUL AGAINST INFINITY AND BREAKS IT THERE? THE ANONYMOUS ANGELS—HUDDLED UNDER THEIR AGELESS WINGS, ETERNALLY VICTORS AND VANQUISHED IN GOD, NUMB TO THE DEADLY CURIOSITIES, DREAMERS PARALLEL TO THE EARTHLY GRIEFS—WHO WOULD DARE TO CAST THE FIRST STONE AT THEM AND, IN DEFIANCE, DIVIDE THEIR SLEEP? REVOLT, THE PRIDE OF DOWNFALL, TAKES ITS NOBILITY ONLY FROM ITS USELESSNESS: SUFFERINGS AWAKEN IT AND THEN ABANDON IT; FRENZY EXALTS IT AND DISAPPOINTMENT DENIES IT. . . . REVOLT CANNOT HAVE A MEANING IN A NON-VALID UNIVERSE. . . .

(IN THIS WORLD NOTHING IS IN ITS PLACE, BEGINNING WITH THIS WORLD ITSELF. WE MUST THEREFORE NOT BE SURPRISED BY THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN INJUSTICE. IT IS EQUALLY FUTILE TO REFUSE OR TO ACCEPT THE SOCIAL ORDER: WE MUST ENDURE ITS CHANGES FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE WITH A DESPAIRING CONFORMISM, AS WE ENDURE BIRTH, LOVE, THE WEATHER, AND DEATH. DECOMPOSITION PRESIDES OVER THE LAWS OF LIFE: CLOSER TO OUR DUST THAN INANIMATE OBJECTS TO THEIRS, WE SUCCUMB BEFORE THEM AND RASH UPON OUR DESTINY UNDER THE GAZE OF THE APPARENTLY INDESTRUCTIBLE STARS. BUT THEY THEMSELVES WILL CRUMBLE IN A UNIVERSE WHICH ONLY OUR HEART TAKES SERIOUSLY, LATER EXPIATING ITS LACK OF IRONY BY TERRIBLE LACERATIONS. . . .

NO ONE CAN CORRECT GOD’S INJUSTICE OR THAT OF MEN: EVERY ACTION IS MERELY A SPECIAL, APPARENTLY ORGANIZED CASE OF THE ORIGINAL CHAOS. WE ARE SWEPT ON BY A WHIRLWIND WHICH DATES BACK TO THE DAWN OF TIME; AND IF THIS WHIRLWIND HAS ASSUMED THE ASPECT OF AN ORDER, IT IS ONLY THE BETTER TO DO AWAY WITH US. . . .)

THE CONCERN FOR DECENCY
UNDER THE GOAD OF PAIN, THE FLESH AWAKENS; LUCID AND LYRICAL SUBSTANCE, IT SINGS ITS DISSOLUTION. SO LONG AS IT WAS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM NATURE, IT RESTED IN THE OBLIVION OF ELEMENTS: THE SELF HAD NOT YET SEIZED UPON IT. SUFFERING MATTER FREES ITSELF FROM GRAVITATION, NO LONGER PARTICIPATES IN THE UNIVERSE, ISOLATES ITSELF FROM THE SOMNOLENT SUM; FOR PAIN, AN AGENT OF SEPARATION, THE ACTIVE PRINCIPLE OF INDIVIDUATION, DENIES THE PLEASURES OF A STATISTICAL DESTINY.

THE TRULY SOLITARY BEING IS NOT THE MAN WHO IS ABANDONED BY MEN, BUT THE MAN WHO SUFFERS IN THEIR MIDST, WHO DRAGS HIS DESERT THROUGH THE MARKETPLACE AND DEPLOYS HIS TALENTS AS A SMILING LEPER, A MOUNTEBANK OF THE IRREPARABLE. THE GREAT SOLITARIES WERE HAPPY IN THE OLD DAYS, KNEW NOTHING OF DUPLICITY, HAD NOTHING TO HIDE: THEY CONVERSED ONLY WITH THEIR OWN SOLITUDE. . . .

OF ALL THE BONDS WHICH LINK US TO THINGS, THERE IS NOT ONE WHICH FAILS TO SLACKEN AND DISSOLVE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SUFFERING, WHICH FREES US FROM EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE OBSESSION OF OURSELVES AND THE SENSATION OF BEING IRREVOCABLY INDIVIDUAL SUFFERING IS SOLITUDE HYPOSTATIZED AS ESSENCE BY WHAT MEANS, THEN, COMMUNICATE WITH OTHERS EXCEPT BY THE PRESTIDIGITATION OF LYING? FOR IF WE WERE NOT JUGGLERS, IF WE HAD NOT LEARNED THE ARTIFICES OF A KNOWING CHARLATANISM, IF INDEED WE WERE SINCERE TO THE POINT OF SHAMELESSNESS OR TRAGEDY—OUR UNDERGROUND WORLDS WOULD VOMIT UP OCEANS OF GALL, IN WHICH IT WOULD BE A POINT OF HONOR FOR US TO VANISH: THEREBY WE SHOULD FLEE THE UNSEEMLINESS OF SO MUCH GROTESQUERIE AND SUBLIMITY. AT A CERTAIN DEGREE OF MISERY, ALL FRANKNESS BECOMES INDECENT. JOB STOPPED JUST IN TIME: ONE STEP FURTHER, AND NEITHER GOD NOR HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE ANSWERED HIM AGAIN.

(ONE IS “CIVILIZED” INSOFAR AS ONE DOES NOT PROCLAIM ONE’S LEPROSY, AS ONE EVINCES RESPECT FOR THE ELEGANT FALSEHOODS FORGED BY THE AGES. NO ONE IS ENTITLED TO STAGGER UNDER THE BURDEN OF HIS HOURS . . . EVERY MAN HARBORS A POSSIBILITY OF APOCALYPSE, BUT EVERY MAN MAKES IT A RULE TO LEVEL HIS OWN ABYSSES. IF EACH OF US GAVE FREE REIN TO HIS SOLITUDE, GOD WOULD HAVE TO REMAKE THE WORLD, WHOSE EXISTENCE DEPENDS AT EVERY POINT ON OUR EDUCATION AND ON THIS FEAR WE HAVE OF OURSELVES. . . CHAOS? CHAOS IS REJECTING ALL YOU HAVE LEARNED, CHAOS IS BEING YOURSELF. . .)

GAMUT OF THE VOID
I HAVE SEEN ONE MAN PURSUE THIS GOAL, ANOTHER THAT ONE; I HAVE SEEN MEN FASCINATED BY DISPARATE OBJECTS, UNDER THE SPELL OF DREAMS AND PLANS AT ONCE VILE AND INDEFINABLE. ANALYZING EACH CASE IN ISOLATION IN ORDER TO PENETRATE THE REASONS FOR SO MUCH FERVOR SQUANDERED, I HAVE REALIZED THE NON-MEANING OF ALL ACTION AND ALL EFFORT. IS THERE A SINGLE LIFE WHICH IS NOT IMPREGNATED WITH LIFE-GIVING ERRORS, A SINGLE CLEAR, TRANSPARENT LIFE WITHOUT HUMILIATING ROOTS, WITHOUT INVENTED MOTIVES, WITHOUT MYTHS EMERGING FROM DESIRES? WHERE IS THE ACTION PURE OF ALL UTILITY: SUN ABHORRING INCANDESCENCE, ANGEL IN A UNIVERSE WITHOUT FAITH, OR IDLE WORM IN A WORLD ABANDONED TO IMMORTALITY?

I HAVE TRIED TO PROTECT MYSELF AGAINST MEN, TO REACT AGAINST THEIR MADNESS, TO DISCERN ITS SOURCE; I HAVE LISTENED AND I HAVE SEEN—AND I HAVE BEEN AFRAID—AFRAID OF ACTING FOR THE SAME MOTIVES OR FOR ANY MOTIVE WHATEVER, OF BELIEVING IN THE SAME GHOSTS OR IN ANY OTHER GHOST, OF LETTING MYSELF BE ENGULFED BY DIE SAME INTOXICATIONS OR BY SOME OTHER . . . AFRAID, IN SHORT, OF RAVING IN COMMON AND OF EXPIRING IN A HORDE OF ECSTASIES. I KNEW THAT BY SEPARATING FROM SOMEONE, I WAS DISPOSSESSED OF A FALLACY, I WAS DEPRIVED OF THE ILLUSION I WAS LOVING HIM . . . HIS FEVERISH WORDS REVEALED HIM THE CAPTIVE OF AN EVIDENCE ABSOLUTE FOR HIM AND ABSURD FOR ME; ON CONTACT WITH HIS VACUITY, I STRIPPED MYSELF OF MINE. . . . WHOM CAN WE ADHERE TO WITHOUT THE FEELING OF DECEPTION—WITHOUT BLUSHING? WE CAN JUSTIFY ONLY THE MAN WHO PRACTICES, IN FULL AWARENESS THE IRRATIONAL NECESSARY TO EVERY ACTION, AND WHO EMBELLISHES WITH NO DREAM THE FICTION TO WHICH HE SURRENDERS HIMSELF, AS WE CAN ADMIRE ONLY A HERO WHO DIES WITHOUT CONVICTION, ALL THE MORE READY FOR SACRIFICE IN THAT HE HAS SEEN THROUGH IT. AS FOR LOVERS, THEY WOULD BE HATEFUL IF AMONG THEIR GRIMACES THE PRESENTIMENT OF DEATH DID NOT HOVER, CARESSING. . . . IT IS DISTURBING TO THINK THAT WE CARRY OUR SECRET—OUR ILLUSION—INTO THE GRAVE, THAT WE HAVE NOT SURVIVED THE MYSTERIOUS MISTAKE THAT VIVIFIED OUR EVERY BREATH, THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE SKEPTICS AND WHORES AMONG US, ALL FOUNDER IN FALSEHOOD BECAUSE THEY FAIL TO DIVINE THE EQUIVALENCE, IN NULLITY, OF TRIUMPHS AND TRUTHS.

I WANTED TO SUPPRESS IN MYSELF THE REASONS MEN INVOKE IN ORDER TO EXIST, IN ORDER TO ACT. I WANTED TO BECOME UNSPEAKABLY NORMAL—AND HERE I AM IN DAZED CONFUSION, ON A FOOTING WITH FOOLS, AND AS EMPTY AS THEY.

CERTAIN MORNINGS
REGRET NOT TO BE ATLAS, NOT TO BE ABLE TO SHRUG MY SHOULDERS AND WATCH THE COLLAPSE OF THIS LAUGHABLE MATTER. . . . RAGE TAKES THE OPPOSITE PATH OF COSMOGONY. BY WHAT MYSTERIES DO WE WAKE, CERTAIN MORNINGS, WITH THE THIRST TO DEMOLISH THE WHOLE OF CREATION, INERT AND ANIMATE ALIKE? WHEN THE DEVIL DROWNS HIMSELF IN OUR VEINS, WHEN OUR IDEAS TURN CONVULSIVE AND OUR DESIRES CLEAVE THE LIGHT, THE ELEMENTS CATCH FIRE AND CONSUME THEMSELVES, WHILE OUR FINGERS SIFT THEIR ASHES.

WHAT NIGHTMARES HAVE WE SUSTAINED FOR NIGHTS ON END TO WAKE UP IN THE MORNINGS ENEMIES OF THE SUN? MUST WE LIQUIDATE OURSELVES TO PUT AN END TO EVERYTHING? WHAT COMPLICITY, WHAT BONDS EXTEND US INTO AN INTIMACY WITH TIME? LIFE WOULD BE INTOLERABLE WITHOUT THE FORCES WHICH DENY IT. MASTERS OF A POSSIBLE EXIT, OF THE IDEA OF AN ESCAPE, WE MIGHT READILY ABOLISH OURSELVES AND, AT THE APEX OF DELIRIUM, EXPECTORATE THIS UNIVERSE.

. . . OR ELSE PRAY AND WAIT FOR OTHER MORNINGS.

(TO WRITE WOULD BE AN INSIPID AND SUPERFLUOUS ACTION IF WE COULD WEEP AT WILL, IMITATING WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN THEIR FITS OF RAGE. . . . IN THE SUBSTANCE OF WHICH WE ARE MADE, IN ITS DEEPEST IMPURITY, ABIDES A PRINCIPLE OF BITTERNESS WHICH ONLY TEARS CAN SWEETEN. IF, EACH TIME DISAPPOINTMENTS ASSAIL US, WE HAD THE POSSIBILITY TO BE RELEASED FROM THEM BY TEARS, ALL VAGUE MALADIES AND POETRY ITSELF WOULD DISAPPEAR. BUT A NATIVE RETICENCE, AGGRAVATED BY EDUCATION, OR A DEFECTIVE FUNCTIONING OF THE LACHRYMAL GLANDS, DOOMS US TO THE MARTYRDOM OF DRY EYES. AND THEN SHRIEKS, STORMS OF SWEARING, SELF-MACERATION, AND FINGERNAILS FURROWING THE FLESH, WITH THE CONSOLATIONS OF A SPECTACLE OF BLOOD, NO LONGER FIGURE AMONG OUR THERAPEUTIC METHODS. IT FOLLOWS THAT WE ARE ALL SICK, AND THAT EACH OF US WOULD REQUIRE A SAHARA IN ORDER TO SCREAM OUR LUNGS OUT, OR THE SHORES OF A WILD AND ELEGIAC SEA IN ORDER TO MINGLE WITH ITS FIERCE LAMENTATIONS OUR EVEN FIERCER ONES. OUR PAROXYSMS REQUIRE THE CONTEXT OF A PARODIC SUBLIMITY, OF AN APOPLECTIC INFINITY, THE VISION OF A HANGING WHERE THE FIRMAMENT WOULD SERVE AS A GALLOWS TO OUR CARCASSES AND TO THE ELEMENTS.)

MILITANT MOURNING
ALL TRUTHS ARE AGAINST US. BUT WE GO ON LIVING, BECAUSE WE ACCEPT THEM IN THEMSELVES, BECAUSE WE REFUSE TO DRAW THE CONSEQUENCES. WHERE IS THE MAN WHO HAS TRANSLATED—IN HIS BEHAVIOR—A SINGLE CONCLUSION OF THE LESSONS OF ASTRONOMY, OF BIOLOGY, AND WHO HAS DECIDED NEVER TO LEAVE HIS BED AGAIN OUT OF REBELLION OR HUMILITY IN THE FACE OF THE SIDEREAL DISTANCES OR THE NATURAL PHENOMENA? HAS PRIDE EVER BEEN CONQUERED BY THE EVIDENCE OF OUR UNREALITY? AND WHO WAS EVER BOLD ENOUGH TO DO NOTHING BECAUSE EVERY ACTION IS SENSELESS IN INFINITY? THE SCIENCES PROVE OUR NOTHINGNESS. BUT WHO HAS GRASPED THEIR ULTIMATE TEACHING? WHO HAS BECOME A HERO OF TOTAL SLOTH? NO ONE FOLDS HIS ARMS: WE ARE BUSIER THAN THE ANTS AND THE BEES. YET IF AN ANT, IF A BEE—BY THE MIRACLE OF AN IDEA OR BY SOME TEMPTATION OF SINGULARITY— WERE TO ISOLATE HERSELF IN THE ANTHILL OR THE HIVE, IF SHE CONTEMPLATED FROM OUTSIDE THE SPECTACLE OF HER LABORS, WOULD SHE STILL PERSIST IN HER PAINS?

ONLY THE RATIONAL ANIMAL HAS BEEN ABLE TO LEARN NOTHING FROM HIS PHILOSOPHY: HE LOCATES HIMSELF APART—AND PERSEVERES NONETHELESS IN THE SAME ERRORS OF EFFECTIVE APPEARANCE AND VOID REALITY. SEEN FROM OUTSIDE, FROM ANY ARCHIMEDEAN POINT, LIFE—WITH ALL ITS BELIEFS—IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE, NOR EVEN CONCEIVABLE. WE CAN ACT ONLY AGAINST THE TRUTH. MAN STARTS OVER AGAIN EVERY DAY, IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING HE KNOWS, AGAINST EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. HE HAS EXTENDED THIS AMBIGUITY TO THE POINT OF VICE: PERSPICACITY IS IN MOURNING, BUT—STRANGE CONTAGION—THIS VERY MOURNING IS ACTIVE; THUS WE ARE LED INTO A FUNERAL PROCESSION TO THE LAST JUDGMENT; THUS, OUT OF THE ULTIMATE REST ITSELF, OUT OF HISTORY’S FINAL SILENCE, WE HAVE MADE AN ACTIVITY: THE STAGING OF THE AGONY, THE NEED FOR DYNAMISM EVEN IN THE DEATH-RATTLES. . . .

(THE PANTING CIVILIZATIONS EXHAUST THEMSELVES FASTER THAN THOSE THAT LOLL IN ETERNITY. CHINA ALONE, THRIVING FOR MILLENNIA IN THE FLOWER OF HER OLD AGE, OFFERS AN EXAMPLE TO BE FOLLOWED; CHINA ALONE LONG SINCE ARRIVED AT A REFINED WISDOM SUPERIOR TO PHILOSOPHY: TAOISM SURPASSES ALL THE MIND HAS CONCEIVED BY WAY OF DETACHMENT. WE COUNT BY GENERATIONS: IT IS THE CURSE OF SCARCELY CENTURY-OLD CIVILIZATIONS TO HAVE LOST, IN THEIR RUSHED CADENCE, THE ATEMPORAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

BY ALL EVIDENCE WE ARE IN THE WORLD TO DO NOTHING; BUT INSTEAD OF NONCHALANTLY PROMENADING OUR CORRUPTION, WE EXUDE OUR SWEAT AND GROW WINDED UPON THE FETID AIR. ALL HISTORY IS IN A STATE OF PUTREFACTION; ITS ODORS SHIFT TOWARD THE FUTURE: WE RUSH TOWARD IT, IF ONLY FOR THE FEVER INHERENT IN ANY DECOMPOSITION.

IT IS TOO LATE FOR HUMANITY TO BE RELEASED FROM THE ILLUSION OF ACTION, IT IS ESPECIALLY TOO LATE FOR IT TO BE RAISED TO THE SANCTITY OF SLOTH)

IMMUNITY TO RENUNCIATION
EVERYTHING WHICH DEALS WITH ETERNITY INEVITABLY TURNS INTO A COMMONPLACE. THE WORLD ENDS BY ACCEPTING ANY REVELATION AND RESIGNS ITSELF TO ANY SHUDDER, PROVIDED THAT A FORMULA IS FOUND FOR IT. THE NOTION OF UNIVERSAL FUTILITY—MORE DANGEROUS THAN ANY SCOURGE—HAS BEEN DEBASED INTO THE OBVIOUS: EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES AS MUCH, AND NO ONE BEHAVES ACCORDINGLY. THE TERROR OF AN ULTIMATE TRUTH HAS BEEN TAMED; ONCE IT TURNS INTO A REFRAIN, MEN NO LONGER THINK ABOUT IT, FOR THEY HAVE LEARNED BY HEART A THING WHICH, MERELY GLIMPSED, SHOULD CAST THEM INTO THE ABYSS OR SALVATION. THE VISION OF TIME’S NULLITY HAS BEGOTTEN SAINTS AND POETS, AND THE DESPAIRS OF A FEW SOLITARIES, INFATUATED WITH ANATHEMA. . . .

THIS VISION IS NO NEWS TO THE CROWD; THE CROWD CONTINUALLY ASKS: “WHAT’S THE USE?"; “WHAT DOES IT MATTER?"; “IT’S NOT THE FIRST TIME"; “PLUS ÇA CHANGE . . . “—AND YET NOTHING HAPPENS, NOTHING INTERVENES: NOT ONE SAINT, NOT ONE POET MORE. .. . IF THE CROWD CONFORMED TO A SINGLE ONE OF THESE REFRAINS, THE FACE OF THE WORLD WOULD BE TRANSFORMED. BUT ETERNITY—APPEARING FROM AN ANTI-VITAL THOUGHT—CANNOT BE A HUMAN REFLEX WITHOUT DANGER FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF ACTIONS: IT BECOMES A COMMONPLACE, SO THAT WE CAN FORGET IT BY A MECHANICAL REPETITION. SANCTITY IS A RISK LIKE POETRY. MEN SAY “EVERYTHING PASSES"—BUT HOW MANY GRASP THE BEARING OF THIS TERRIFYING BANALITY? HOW MANY FLEE LIFE, CELEBRATE OR BEWAIL IT? WHO IS NOT IMBUED WITH THE CONVICTION THAT ALL IS VANITY? BUT WHO DARES CONFRONT THE CONSEQUENCES? THE MAN WITH A METAPHYSICAL VOCATION IS RARER THAN A MONSTER—AND YET EACH MAN CONTAINS THE POTENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THIS VOCATION. IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ONE HINDU PRINCE TO SEE A CRIPPLE, AN OLD MAN, AND A CORPSE TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING; WE SEE THEM AND UNDERSTAND NOTHING, FOR NOTHING CHANGES IN OUR LIFE. WE CANNOT RENOUNCE ANYTHING; YET THE EVIDENCES OF VANITY ARE IN OUR REACH. INVALIDS OF HOPE, WE ARE STILL WAITING; AND LIFE IS ONLY THE HYPOSTATIZATION OF WAITING. WE WAIT FOR EVERYTHING—EVEN NOTHINGNESS—RATHER THAN BE REDUCED TO AN ETERNAL SUSPENSION, TO A CONDITION OF NEUTRAL DIVINITY, OF A CORPSE. THUS THE HEART, WHICH HAS MADE THE IRREPARABLE INTO AN AXIOM, STILL HOPES FOR SURPRISES FROM IT. HUMANITY LIVES IN LOVE WITH THE EVENTS WHICH DENY IT. . . .

THE WORLD’S EQUILIBRIUM
THE APPARENT SYMMETRY OF JOYS AND PAINS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THEIR EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION: IT RESULTS FROM THE INJUSTICE WHICH STRIKES CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS, THEREBY FORCING THEM TO COMPENSATE BY THEIR DESPONDENCY FOR THE OTHERS' UNCONCERN. TO ENDURE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR ACTIONS, OR TO BE SAVED FROM THEM—SUCH IS THE LOT OF MEN. THIS DISCRIMINATION IS EFFECTED WITHOUT ANY CRITERION: IT IS A FATALITY, AN ABSURD APPORTIONMENT, A FANTASTIC SELECTION. NO ONE CAN ELUDE THE CONDEMNATION TO HAPPINESS OR MISERY, NOR THE INNATE SENTENCE AT THE PREPOSTEROUS TRIBUNAL WHOSE DECISION EXTENDS BETWEEN THE SPERMATOZOON AND THE SEPULCHER.

SOME MEN PAY FOR ALL THEIR JOYS, EXPIATE ALL THEIR PLEASURES, ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL THEIR INTERVALS OF OBLIVION: THEY WILL NEVER BE INDEBTED FOR A SINGLE MOMENT OF HAPPINESS. FOR THEM A THOUSAND ACRIMONIES HAVE CROWNED A SHUDDER OF PLEASURE AS IF THEY HAD NO RIGHT TO ACKNOWLEDGED CONTENTMENTS, AS IF THEIR ABANDONMENT ENDANGERED THE WORLD’S BESTIAL EQUILIBRIUM. . . . WERE THEY HAPPY IN SOME LANDSCAPE?—THEY WILL REGRET IT IN IMMINENT DISAPPOINTMENTS; WERE THEY PROUD IN THEIR PLANS AND THEIR DREAMS? THEY WILL SOON WAKE, AS FROM A UTOPIA, CORRECTED BY ALL-TOO-POSITIVE SUFFERINGS.

THUS THERE ARE SACRIFICED MEN WHO PAY FOR THE UNCONSCIOUSNESS OF OTHERS, WHO EXPIATE NOT ONLY THEIR OWN HAPPINESS BUT THAT OF STRANGERS. THUS EQUILIBRIUM IS RESTORED; THE PROPORTION OF JOYS AND PAINS BECOMES HARMONIOUS. IF AN OBSCURE UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE HAS DECREED THAT YOU BELONG TO THE ORDER OF VICTIMS, YOU WILL END YOUR DAYS STAMPING UNDERFOOT THE SPECK OF PARADISE YOU HID WITHIN YOURSELF, AND WHATEVER IMPULSE GLEAMED IN YOUR EYES AND YOUR DREAMS WILL BE SULLIED BY THE IMPURITY OF TIME, MATTER, AND MEN. YOU WILL HAVE A DUNGHEAP FOR PEDESTAL, FOR TRIBUNE A RACK AND THUMB SCREW. YOU WILL BE WORTHY OF NO MORE THAN A LEPROUS GLORY AND A CROWN OF SPIT. TRY TO WALK BESIDE THOSE ENTITLED TO EVERYTHING, TO WHOM ALL PATHS ARE OPEN? BUT DUST AND ASHES THEMSELVES WILL RISE UP TO BAR YOU FROM THE EXITS OF TIME AND THE EVASIONS OF DREAMS. WHATEVER DIRECTION YOU TAKE, YOUR STEPS WILL BE MIRED, YOUR VOICES WILL PROCLAIM ONLY THE HYMNS OF MUD, AND OVER YOUR BENT HEADS, YOUR HEAVY HEARTS, IN WHICH ONLY SELF-PITY DWELLS, WILL PASS NO MORE THAN THE BREATH OF THE HAPPY, BLESSED TOYS OF A NAMELESS IRONY AS LITTLE TO BLAME AS YOU ARE.

FAREWELL TO PHILOSOPHY
I TURNED AWAY FROM PHILOSOPHY WHEN IT BECAME IMPOSSIBLE TO DISCOVER IN KANT ANY HUMAN WEAKNESS, ANY AUTHENTIC ACCENT OF MELANCHOLY; IN KANT AND IN ALL THE PHILOSOPHERS. COMPARED TO MUSIC, MYSTICISM, AND POETRY, PHILOSOPHICAL ACTIVITY PROCEEDS FROM A DIMINISHED IMPULSE AND A SUSPECT DEPTH, PRESTIGIOUS ONLY FOR THE TIMID AND THE TEPID. MOREOVER, PHILOSOPHY—IMPERSONAL ANXIETY, REFUGE AMONG ANEMIC IDEAS—IS THE RECOURSE OF ALL WHO WOULD ELUDE THE CORRUPTING EXUBERANCE OF LIFE. ALMOST ALL THE PHILOSOPHERS CAME TO A GOOD END: THAT IS THE SUPREME ARGUMENT AGAINST PHILOSOPHY. EVEN SOCRATES' DEATH HAS NOTHING TRAGIC ABOUT IT: IT IS A MISUNDERSTANDING, THE END OF A PEDAGOGUE—AND IF NIETZSCHE FOUNDERED, IT WAS AS A POET AND VISIONARY: HE EXPIATED HIS ECSTASIES AND NOT HIS ARGUMENTS.

WE CANNOT ELUDE EXISTENCE BY EXPLANATIONS, WE CAN ONLY ENDURE IT, LOVE OR HATE IT, ADORE OR DREAD IT, IN THAT ALTERNATION OF HAPPINESS AND HORROR WHICH EXPRESSES THE VERY RHYTHM OF BEING, ITS OSCILLATIONS, ITS DISSONANCES, ITS BRIGHT OR BITTER VEHEMENCES.

EXPOSED BY SURPRISE OR NECESSITY TO AN IRREFUTABLE DEFEAT, WHO DOES NOT RAISE HIS HANDS IN PRAYER THEN, ONLY TO LET THEM FALL EMPTIER STILL FOR THE ANSWERS OF PHILOSOPHY? IT WOULD SEEM THAT ITS MISSION IS TO PROTECT US AS LONG AS FATE’S NEGLECT ALLOWS US TO PROCEED ON THE BRINK OF CHAOS, AND TO ABANDON US AS SOON AS WE ARE FORCED TO PLUNGE OVER THE EDGE. AND HOW COULD IT BE OTHERWISE, WHEN WE SEE HOW LITTLE OF HUMANITY’S SUFFERING HAS PASSED INTO ITS PHILOSOPHY? THE PHILOSOPHIC EXERCISE IS NOT FRUITFUL; IT IS MERELY HONORABLE. WE ARE ALWAYS PHILOSOPHERS WITH IMPUNITY: A MÉTIER WITHOUT FATE WHICH POURS VOLUMINOUS THOUGHTS INTO OUR NEUTRAL AND VACANT HOURS, THE HOURS REFRACTORY TO THE OLD TESTAMENT, TO BACH, AND TO SHAKESPEARE. AND HAVE THESE THOUGHTS MATERIALIZED INTO A SINGLE PAGE THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO ONE OF JOB’S EXCLAMATIONS, OF MACBETH’S TERRORS, OR THE ALTITUDE OF ONE OF BACH’S CANTATAS? WE DO NOT ARGUE THE UNIVERSE; WE EXPRESS IT. AND PHILOSOPHY DOES NOT EXPRESS IT. THE REAL PROBLEMS BEGIN ONLY AFTER HAVING RANGED OR EXHAUSTED IT, AFTER THE LAST CHAPTER OF A HUGE TOME WHICH PRINTS THE FINAL PERIOD AS AN ABDICATION BEFORE THE UNKNOWN, IN WHICH ALL OUR MOMENTS ARE ROOTED AND WITH WHICH WE MUST STRUGGLE BECAUSE IT IS NATURALLY MORE IMMEDIATE, MORE IMPORTANT THAN OUR DAILY BREAD. HERE THE PHILOSOPHER LEAVES US: ENEMY OF DISASTER, HE IS SANE AS REASON ITSELF, AND AS PRUDENT. AND WE REMAIN IN THE COMPANY OF AN OLD PLAGUE VICTIM, OF A POET LEARNED IN EVERY LUNACY, AND OF A MUSICIAN WHOSE SUBLIMITY TRANSCENDS THE SPHERE OF THE HEART. WE BEGIN TO EVE AUTHENTICALLY ONLY WHERE PHILOSOPHY ENDS, AT ITS WRECK, WHEN WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD ITS TERRIBLE NULLITY, WHEN WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS FUTILE TO RESORT TO IT, THAT IT IS NO HELP.

(THE GREAT SYSTEMS ARE ACTUALLY NO MORE THAN BRILLIANT TAUTOLOGIES. WHAT ADVANTAGE IS IT TO KNOW THAT THE NATURE OF BEING CONSISTS IN THE “WILL TO LIVE,” IN “IDEA,” OR IN THE WHIM OF GOD OR OF CHEMISTRY? A MERE PROLIFERATION OF WORDS, SUBTLE DISPLACEMENTS OF MEANINGS. WHAT IS LOATHES THE VERBAL EMBRACE, AND OUR INMOST EXPERIENCE REVEALS US NOTHING BEYOND THE PRIVILEGED AND INEXPRESSIBLE MOMENT. MOREOVER, BEING ITSELF IS ONLY A PRETENSION OF NOTHINGNESS.

WE DEFINE ONLY OUT OF DESPAIR. WE MUST HAVE A FORMULA, WE MUST EVEN HAVE MANY, IF ONLY TO GIVE JUSTIFICATION TO THE MIND AND A FACADE TO THE VOID.

NEITHER CONCEPT NOR ECSTASY ARE FUNCTIONAL. WHEN MUSIC PLUNGES US INTO THE “INWARDNESS” OF BEING, WE RAPIDLY RETURN TO THE SURFACE: THE EFFECTS OF THE ILLUSION SCATTER AND OUR KNOWLEDGE ADMITS ITS NULLITY.

THE THINGS WE TOUCH AND THOSE WE CONCEIVE ARE AS IMPROBABLE AS OUR SENSES AND OUR REASON; WE ARE SURE ONLY IN OUR VERBAL UNIVERSE, MANAGEABLE AT WILL—AND INEFFECTUAL. BEING IS MUTE AND THE MIND IS GARRULOUS. THIS IS CALLED KNOWING.

THE PHILOSOPHER’S ORIGINALITY COMES DOWN TO INVENTING TERMS. SINCE THERE ARE ONLY THREE OR FOUR ATTITUDES BY WHICH TO CONFRONT THE WORLD— AND ABOUT AS MANY WAYS OF DYING—THE NUANCES WHICH MULTIPLY AND DIVERSIFY THEM DERIVE FROM NO MORE THAN THE CHOICE OF WORDS, BEREFT OF ANY METAPHYSICAL RANGE.

WE ARE ENGULFED IN A PLEONASTIC UNIVERSE, IN WHICH THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS AMOUNT TO THE SAME THING.)

FRONT SAINT TO CYNIC
MOCKERY HAS DEGRADED EVERYTHING TO THE RANK OF A PRETEXT, EXCEPT FOR THE SUN AND HOPE, EXCEPT FOR THE TWO CONDITIONS OF LIFE: THE WORLD’S CENTER AND THE HEART’S, THE ONE DAZZLING, THE OTHER INVISIBLE. A SKELETON, WARMING IN THE SUN AND HOPING, WOULD BE MORE VIGOROUS THAN A DESPAIRING HERCULES WEARY OF THE LIGHT; A BEING TOTALLY PERMEABLE TO HOPE WOULD BE MORE POWERFUL THAN GOD AND MORE VITAL THAN LIFE. MACBETH, “AWEARY OF THE SUN,” IS THE LAST OF CREATURES, TRUE DEATH NOT BEING CORRUPTION BUT THE DISGUST WITH OUR IRRADIATION, THE REPULSION FOR ALL THAT IS A SEED, FOR ALL THAT GROWS IN THE WARMTH OF ILLUSION.

MAN HAS PROFANED THE THINGS WHICH ARE BORN AND DIE UNDER THE SUN, EXCEPT FOR THE SUN; THE THINGS WHICH ARE BORN AND DIE IN HOPE, EXCEPT FOR HOPE. NOT HAVING HAD THE COURAGE TO GO FURTHER, HE HAS IMPOSED LIMITS UPON HIS CYNICISM. A CYNIC, WHO CLAIMS TO BE CONSISTENT, IS A CYNIC IN WORDS ONLY; HIS GESTURES MAKE HIM THE MOST CONTRADICTORY BEING: NO ONE CAN LIVE AFTER HAVING DECIMATED HIS SUPERSTITIONS. TO REACH TOTAL CYNICISM WOULD REQUIRE AN EFFORT WHICH IS THE CONVERSE OF SANCTITY’S AND AT LEAST AS CONSIDERABLE; OR ELSE, IMAGINE A SAINT WHO, HAVING REACHED THE PINNACLE OF HIS PURIFICATION, DISCOVERS THE VANITY OF THE TROUBLE HE HAS TAKEN—AND THE ABSURDITY OF GOD. . . .

SUCH A MONSTER OF LUCIDITY WOULD CHANGE THE DATA OF LIFE: HE WOULD HAVE THE STRENGTH AND THE AUTHORITY TO QUESTION THE VERY CONDITIONS OF HIS EXISTENCE; HE WOULD NO LONGER BE IN DANGER OF CONTRADICTING HIMSELF; NO HUMAN FAILING WOULD THEN WEAKEN HIS AUDACITIES; HAVING LOST THE RELIGIOUS RESPECT WE PAY DESPITE OURSELVES TO OUR LAST ILLUSIONS, HE WOULD MAKE A PLAYTHING OF HIS HEART, AND OF THE SUN. . . .

RETURN TO THE ELEMENTS
IF PHILOSOPHY HAD MADE NO PROGRESS SINCE THE PRE-SOCRATICS, THERE WOULD BE NO REASON TO COMPLAIN. EXHAUSTED BY THE JUMBLE OF CONCEPTS, WE END BY REALIZING THAT OUR LIFE IS STILL LIVED OUT IN THE ELEMENTS OUT OF WHICH THEY CONSTITUTED THE WORLD, THAT IT IS THE EARTH, FIRE, AIR, AND WATER WHICH CONDITION US, THAT THIS RUDIMENTARY PHYSICS REVEALS THE CONTEXT OF OUR ORDEALS AND THE PRINCIPLE OF OUR TORMENTS. HAVING COMPLICATED THESE FEW ELEMENTARY DATA, WE HAVE LOST—FASCINATED BY THE DECOR AND THE STRUCTURE OF OUR THEORIES—THE UNDERSTANDING OF DESTINY, WHICH NONETHELESS, UNCHANGED, IS THE SAME AS ON THE WORLD’S FIRST DAY. OUR EXISTENCE REDUCED TO ITS ESSENCE CONTINUES TO BE A STRUGGLE AGAINST THE ETERNAL ELEMENTS, A STRUGGLE WHICH OUR KNOWLEDGE IN NO WAY ALLEVIATES. THE HEROES OF EVERY EPOCH ARE NO LESS WRETCHED THAN THOSE OF HOMER, AND IF THEY HAVE BECOME CHARACTERS, IT IS BY LOSING VITALITY AND GREATNESS. HOW COULD THE RESULTS OF THE SCIENCES CHANGE MAN’S METAPHYSICAL POSITION? AND WHAT ARE THE EXPLORATIONS OF MATTER, THE DISCOVERIES AND THE PRODUCTS OF ANALYSIS BESIDE THE VEDIC HYMNS AND THOSE MELANCHOLIES OF HISTORIC DAWN WHICH CREPT INTO THE WORLD’S ANONYMOUS POETRY?

SINCE THE MOST ELOQUENT DECADENCES EDIFY US NO FURTHER AS TO UNHAPPINESS THAN THE STAMMERINGS OF A SHEPHERD, AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS MORE WISDOM IN THE MOCKERY OF AN IDIOT THAN IN THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE LABORATORIES, IS IT NOT MADNESS TO PURSUE TRUTH ON THE PATHS OF TIME—OR IN BOOKS? LAO-TSE, REDUCED TO A FEW TEXTS, IS NOT MORE NAIVE THAN WE WHO HAVE READ EVERYTHING. PROFUNDITY IS INDEPENDENT OF KNOWLEDGE. WE TRANSLATE TO OTHER LEVELS THE REVELATIONS OF THE AGES, OR WE EXPLOIT ORIGINAL INTUITIONS BY THE LATEST ACQUISITIONS OF THOUGHT. THUS HEGEL IS A HERACLITUS WHO HAS READ KANT; AND OUR ENNUI IS AN AFFECTIVE ELEATICISM, THE FICTION OF DIVERSITY UNMASKED AND EXPOSED TO THE HEART. . . .

SUBTERFUGES
ONLY THOSE WHO LIVE OUTSIDE OF ART DRAW THE ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES. SUICIDE, SANCTITY, VICE—SO MANY FORMS OF LACK OF TALENT DIRECT OR DISGUISED, CONFESSION BY WORD, SOUND, OR COLOR HALTS THE AGGLOMERATION OF INNER FORCES AND WEAKENS THEM BY PROJECTING THEM BACK TOWARD THE WORLD OUTSIDE. IT IS A SALUTARY DIMINUTION WHICH MAKES EVERY ACT OF CREATION INTO A COEFFICIENT OF ESCAPE. BUT THE MAN WHO ACCUMULATES ENERGIES LIVES UNDER PRESSURE, A SLAVE TO HIS OWN EXCESSES; NOTHING KEEPS HIM FROM FOUNDERING IN THE ABSOLUTE. . . .

AUTHENTIC TRAGIC EXISTENCE IS ALMOST NEVER TO BE FOUND AMONG THOSE WHO KNOW HOW TO MANAGE THE SECRET POWERS WHICH EXHAUST THEM; DIMINISHING THEIR SOUL BY THEIR WORK, WHERE WOULD THEY FIND THE ENERGY TO ATTAIN TO THE EXTREMITY OF ACTIONS? A HERO IS FULFILLED IN A PROUD MODALITY OF DYING BECAUSE HE LACKED THE FACULTY OF GRADUALLY EXTINGUISHING HIMSELF IN VERSE. ALL HEROISM EXPIATES—BY THE GENIUS OF THE HEART—A DEFAULTING TALENT; EVERY HERO IS A BEING WITHOUT TALENT. AND IT IS THIS DEFICIENCY WHICH PROJECTS HIM FORWARD AND ENRICHES HIM, WHILE THOSE WHO HAVE BY CREATION IMPOVERISHED THEIR INHERITANCE OF THE UNSPEAKABLE, ARE CAST, AS EXISTENCES, INTO THE BACKGROUND, THOUGH THEIR MINDS CAN BE RAISED ABOVE ALL THE REST.

A MAN ELIMINATES HIMSELF FROM THE RANK OF HIS KIND BY THE MONASTERY OR SOME OTHER ARTIFICE—BY MORPHINE, MASTURBATION, OR RUM—WHEREAS A FORM OF EXPRESSION MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM. BUT, ALWAYS PRESENT TO HIMSELF, PERFECT POSSESSOR OF HIS RESERVES AND HIS MISTAKES, BEARING THE SUM OF HIS LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DIMINISHING IT BY THE PRETEXTS OF ART, INVADED BY SELF HE CAN BE ONLY TOTAL IN HIS GESTURES AND HIS RESOLUTIONS, HE CAN DRAW ONLY A CONCLUSION AFFECTING HIM ALTOGETHER, HE CANNOT RELISH THE EXTREMES; HE IS DROWNED IN THEM; AND HE ACTUALLY DROWNS IN VICE, IN GOD, OR IN HIS OWN BLOOD, WHEREAS THE COWARDICES OF EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE MADE HIM RETREAT BEFORE THE SUPREME. THE MAN WHO EXPRESSES HIMSELF DOES NOT ACT AGAINST HIMSELF; HE KNOWS ONLY THE TEMPTATION OF ULTIMATE CONSEQUENCES. AND THE DESERTER IS NOT THE MAN WHO DRAWS THEM, BUT THE MAN WHO SCATTERS AND DIVULGES HIMSELF FOR FEAR LEST, SURRENDERED TO HIMSELF, HE WILL BE RUINED AND WRECKED.

NON-RESISTANCE TO NIGHT
AT FIRST, WE THINK WE ADVANCE TOWARD THE LIGHT; THEN, WEARIED BY AN AIMLESS MARCH, WE LOSE OUR WAY: THE EARTH, LESS AND LESS SECURE, NO LONGER SUPPORTS US; IT OPENS UNDER OUR FEET. VAINLY WE SHOULD TRY TO FOLLOW A PATH TOWARD A SUNLIT GOAL; THE SHADOWS MOUNT WITHIN AND BELOW US. NO GLEAM TO SLOW OUR DESCENT: THE ABYSS SUMMONS US, AND WE LEND AN EAR. ABOVE STILL REMAINS ALL WE WANTED TO BE, ALL THAT HAS NOT HAD THE POWER TO RAISE US HIGHER. AND WE, ONCE IN LOVE WITH THE PEAKS, THEN DISAPPOINTED BY THEM, WE END BY FONDLING OUR FALL, WE HURRY TO FULFILL IT, INSTRUMENTS OF A STRANGE EXECUTION, FASCINATED BY THE ILLUSION OF REACHING THE LIMITS OF THE DARKNESS, THE FRONTIERS OF OUR NOCTURNAL FATE. FEAR OF THE VOID TRANSFORMED INTO A KIND OF VOLUPTUOUS JOY, WHAT LUCK TO GAINSAY THE SUN! INFINITY IN REVERSE, GOD THAT BEGINS BENEATH OUR HEELS, ECSTASY BEFORE THE CREVICES OF BEING, AND THIRST FOR A BLACK HALO, THE VOID IS AN INVERTED DREAM IN WHICH WE ARE ENGULFED.

IF DELIRIUM BECOMES OUR LAW, LET US WEAR A SUBTERRANEAN NIMBUS, A CROWN IN OUR FALL. DETHRONED FROM THIS WORLD, LET US CARRY ITS SCEPTER IN ORDER TO HONOR THE NIGHT WITH A NEW SPLENDOR.

(AND YET THIS FALL—BUT FOR SOME MOMENTS OF POSTURING—IS FAR FROM BEING SOLEMN AND LYRIC. HABITUALLY WE SINK INTO A NOCTURNAL MUD, INTO A DARKNESS QUITE AS MEDIOCRE AS THE LIGHT. . . . LIFE IS MERELY A TORPOR IN CHIAROSCURO, AN INERTIA AMONG THE GLEAMS AND SHADOWS, A CARICATURE OF THAT INWARD SUN WHICH MAKES US BELIEVE, ILLEGITIMATELY, IN OUR EMINENCE OVER THE REST OF MATTER. NOTHING PROVES THAT WE ARE MORE THAN NOTHING. IN ORDER TO EXPERIENCE THAT CONTINUAL EXPANSION IN WHICH WE RIVAL THE GODS, IN WHICH OUR FEVERS TRIUMPH OVER OUR FEARS, WE SHOULD HAVE TO REMAIN AT SO HIGH A TEMPERATURE THAT IT WOULD FINISH US OFF IN A FEW DAYS. BUT OUR ILLUMINATIONS ARE INSTANTANEOUS; FALLS ARE OUR RULE. LIFE IS WHAT DECOMPOSES AT EVERY MOMENT; IT IS A MONOTONOUS LOSS OF LIGHT, AN INSIPID DISSOLUTION IN THE DARKNESS, WITHOUT SCEPTERS, WITHOUT HALOS. . . .)

TURNING A COLD SHOULDER TO TIME
    YESTERDAY TODAY, TOMORROW—THESE ARE SERVANTS' CATEGORIES. FOR THE IDLE MAN, SUMPTUOUSLY SETTLED IN THE INCONSOLABLE, AND WHOM EVERY MOMENT TORMENTS, PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE ARE MERELY VARIABLE APPEARANCES OF ONE AND THE SAME DISEASE, IDENTICAL IN ITS SUBSTANCE, INEXORABLE IN ITS INSINUATION, AND MONOTONOUS IN ITS PERSISTENCE AND THIS DISEASE IS COEXTENSIVE WITH BEING—IT IS BEING.

    I WAS, I AM, OR I SHALL BE—A QUESTION OF GRAMMAR AND NOT OF EXISTENCE. FATE—AS A CARNIVAL OF CHRONOS—LENDS ITSELF TO CONJUGATION, BUT, STRIPPED OF ITS MASKS, IS REVEALED TO BE AS MOTIONLESS AND NAKED AS AN EPITAPH. HOW CAN WE GRANT MORE IMPORTANCE TO THE HOUR WHICH IS THAN TO THE ONE WHICH WAS OR WHICH WILL BE? THE CONTEMPT IN WHICH SERVANTS LIVE— AND EVERY MAN WHO ADHERES TO TIME IS A SERVANT'— REPRESENTS A TRUE STATE OF GRACE, AN ENCHANTED OBSCURATION; AND THIS CONTEMPT—LIKE A SUPERNATURAL VEIL—COVERS THE DAMNATION TO WHICH EVERY ACTION ENGENDERED BY DESIRE IS EXPOSED. BUT FOR THE DISABUSED MAN OF LEISURE, THE PURE FACT OF LIVING, LIVING PURE OF ALL PRAXIS, IS A TASK SO WEARYING, THAT TO ENDURE EXISTENCE AS SUCH SEEMS TO HIM AN EXCESSIVE OCCUPATION, AN EXHAUSTING CAREER—AND 'EVERY GESTURE INORDINATE, IMPRACTICABLE, AND REPEALED.

TWO-FACED FREEDOM
THOUGH THE PROBLEM OF FREEDOM IS INSOLUBLE, WE CAN ALWAYS ARGUE ABOUT IT, ALWAYS SIDE WITH CONTINGENCY OR NECESSITY. . . . OUR TEMPERAMENTS AND OUR PREJUDICES FACILITATE AN OPTION WHICH CUTS SHORT AND SIMPLIFIES THE PROBLEM WITHOUT SOLVING IT. WHEREAS NO THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTION MANAGES TO MAKE IT APPARENT TO US, TO MAKE US EXPERIENCE ITS DENSE AND CONTRADICTORY REALITY, A PRIVILEGED INTUITION PUTS US AT THE VERY HEART OF FREEDOM, DESPITE ALL THE ARGUMENTS INVENTED AGAINST IT. AND WE ARE AFRAID; WE ARE AFRAID OF THE ENORMITY OF THE POSSIBLE, NOT BEING PREPARED FOR A REVELATION SO HUGE AND SO SUDDEN, FOR THAT DANGEROUS BENEFIT TO WHICH WE ASPIRED AND BEFORE WHICH WE RETREAT. WHAT SHALL WE DO—ACCUSTOMED TO CHAINS AND LAWS—-IN THE FACE OF AN INFINITY OF INITIATIVES, OF A DEBAUCH OF DECISIONS? THE SEDUCTION OF THE ARBITRARY ALARMS US. IF WE CAN BEGIN ANY ACTION, IF THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO INSPIRATION AND TO OUR WHIMS, HOW AVOID OUR RUIN IN THE INTOXICATION OF SO MUCH POWER?

CONSCIOUSNESS, SHAKEN BY THIS REVELATION, INTERROGATES ITSELF AND TREMBLES. WHO, IN A WORLD WHERE HE CAN DO ANYTHING, HAS NOT BEEN DIZZIED? THE MURDERER MAKES A IIMITLESS USE OF HIS FREEDOM, AND CANNOT RESIST THE NOTION OF HIS POWER. IT IS WITHIN THE CAPACITIES OF EACH ONE OF US TO TAKE ANOTHER’S LIFE. IF ALL THOSE WE HAVE KILLED IN THOUGHT WERE TO DISAPPEAR FOR GOOD, THE EARTH WOULD BE DEPOPULATED. WE BEAR WITHIN US A RETICENT EXECUTIONER, AN UNREALIZED CRIMINAL. AND THOSE WHO LACK THE BOLDNESS TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR HOMICIDAL TENDENCIES, MURDER IN DREAMS, PEOPLE THEIR NIGHTMARES WITH CORPSES. BEFORE AN ABSOLUTE TRIBUNAL, ONLY THE ANGELS WOULD BE ACQUITTED. FOR THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A HUMAN BEING WHO HAS NOT—AT LEAST UNCONSCIOUSLY—DESIRED THE DEATH OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. EACH OF US DRAGS AFTER HIM A CEMETERY OF FRIENDS AND ENEMIES; AND IT MATTERS LITTLE WHETHER THIS GRAVEYARD IS RELEGATED TO THE HEART’S ABYSS OR PROJECTED TO THE SURFACE OF OUR DESIRES.

FREEDOM, CONCEIVED IN ITS ULTIMATE IMPLICATIONS, RAISES THE QUESTION OF OUR LIFE OR OF OTHERS' LIVES; IT INVOLVES THE DUAL POSSIBILITY OF SAVING OR DESTROYING US. BUT WE FEEL FREE, WE UNDERSTAND OUR OPPORTUNITIES AND OUR DANGERS ONLY BY FITS AND STARTS. AND IT IS THE INTERMITTENCE OF THESE FITS AND STARTS, THEIR RARITY, WHICH EXPLAINS WHY THIS WORLD IS NO MORE THAN A MEDIOCRE SLAUGHTERHOUSE AND A ACTIVE PARADISE. TO ARGUE ABOUT FREEDOM LEADS TO NO CONSEQUENCE IN GOOD OR EVIL; BUT WE HAVE ONLY MOMENTS TO REALIZE THAT EVERYTHING DEPENDS ON US. . . . FREEDOM IS AN ETHICAL PRINCIPLE OF DEMONIC ESSENCE.

OVERWORKED BY DREAMS
IF WE COULD CONSERVE THE ENERGY WE LAVISH IN THAT SERIES OF DREAMS WE NIGHTLY LEAVE BEHIND US, THE MIND’S DEPTH AND SUBTLETY WOULD REACH UNIMAGINABLE PROPORTIONS. THE SCAFFOLDING OF A NIGHTMARE REQUIRES A NERVOUS EXPENDITURE MORE EXHAUSTING THAN THE BEST ARTICULATED THEORETICAL CONSTRUCTION. HOW, AFTER WAKING, BEGIN AGAIN THE TASK OF ALIGNING IDEAS WHEN, IN OUR UNCONSCIOUS, WE WERE MIXED UP WITH GROTESQUE AND MARVELOUS SPECTACLES, WE WERE SAILING AMONG THE SPHERES WITHOUT THE SHACKLES OF ANTI-POETIC CAUSALITY? FOR HOURS WE WERE LIKE DRUNKEN GODS—AND SUDDENLY, OUR OPEN EYES ERASING NIGHT’S INFINITY, WE MUST RESUME, IN DAY’S MEDIOCRITY, THE ENTERPRISE OF INSIPID PROBLEMS, WITHOUT ANY OF THE NIGHT’S HALLUCINATIONS TO HELP US. THE GLORIOUS AND DEADLY FANTASY WAS ALL FOR NOTHING THEN; SLEEP HAS EXHAUSTED US IN VAIN. WAKING, ANOTHER KIND OF WEARINESS AWAITS US; AFTER HAVING HAD JUST TIME ENOUGH TO FORGET THE NIGHT’S, WE ARE AT GRIPS WITH THE DAWN’S. WE HAVE LABORED HOURS AND HOURS IN HORIZONTAL IMMOBILITY WITHOUT OUR BRAIN’S DERIVING THE LEAST ADVANTAGE OF ITS ABSURD ACTIVITY. AN IMBECILE WHO WAS NOT VICTIMIZED BY THIS WASTE, WHO MIGHT ACCUMULATE ALL HIS RESOURCES WITHOUT DISSIPATING THEM IN DREAMS, WOULD BE ABLE—OWNER OF AN IDEAL STATE OF WAKING—TO DISENTANGLE ALL THE SNAGS OF THE METAPHYSICAL LIES OR INITIATE HIMSELF INTO THE MOST INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES OF MATHEMATICS.

AFTER EACH NIGHT WE ARE EMPTIER: OUR MYSTERIES AND OUR GRIEFS HAVE LEAKED AWAY INTO OUR DREAMS. THUS SLEEP’S LABOR NOT ONLY DIMINISHES THE POWER OF OUR THOUGHT, BUT EVEN THAT OF OUR SECRETS. . . .

THE MODEL TRAITOR
SINCE LIFE CAN BE FULFILLED ONLY WITHIN INDIVIDUATION—THAT LAST BASTION OF SOLITUDE—EACH BEING IS NECESSARY ALONE BY THE FACT THAT HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL. YET ALL INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ALONE IN THE SAME WAY NOR WITH THE SAME INTENSITY: EACH OCCUPIES A DIFFERENT RANK IN THE HIERARCHY OF SOLITUDE; AT ONE EXTREME STANDS THE TRAITOR: HE IS AN INDIVIDUAL TO THE POINT OF EXASPERATION. IN THIS SENSE, JUDAS IS THE LONELIEST BEING IN THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY, BUT NOT IN THE HISTORY OF SOLITUDE. HE BETRAYED ONLY A GOD; HE KNEW WHAT HE BETRAYED; HE BETRAYED SOMEONE, AS SO MANY OTHERS BETRAY SOMETHING: A COUNTRY OR OTHER MORE OR LESS COLLECTIVE PRETEXTS. THE BETRAYAL WHICH FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC OBJECT, EVEN IF IT INVOLVES DISHONOR OR DEATH, IS NOT AT ALL MYSTERIOUS: WE ALWAYS HAVE THE IMAGE OF WHAT WE WANT TO DESTROY; GUILT IS CLEAR, WHETHER ADMITTED OR DENIED. THE OTHERS CAST YOU OUT, AND YOU RESIGN YOURSELF TO THE CELL OR THE GUILLOTINE. . . .

BUT THERE EXISTS A MUCH MORE COMPLEX MODALITY OF BETRAYAL, WITHOUT IMMEDIATE REFERENCE, WITHOUT RELATION TO AN OBJECT OR A PERSON. THUS: TO ABANDON EVERYTHING WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THIS EVERYTHING REPRESENTS; TO ISOLATE YOURSELF FROM YOUR MILIEU; TO REJECT—BY A METAPHYSICAL DIVORCE—THE SUBSTANCE WHICH HAS MOLDED YOU, WHICH SURROUNDS YOU, AND WHICH CARRIES YOU.

WHO, AND BY WHAT DEFIANCE, CAN CHALLENGE EXISTENCE WITH IMPUNITY? WHO, AND BY WHAT EFFORTS, CAN ACHIEVE A LIQUIDATION OF THE VERY PRINCIPLE OF HIS OWN BREATH? YET THE WILL TO UNDERMINE THE FOUNDATIONS OF ALL THAT EXISTS PRODUCES A CRAVING FOR NEGATIVE EFFECTIVENESS, POWERFUL AND INEFFABLE AS A WHIFF OF REMORSE CORRUPTING THE YOUNG VITALITY OF A HOPE. . .

WHEN YOU HAVE BETRAYED BEING YOU BEAR WITH YOU ONLY A VAGUE DISCOMFORT; THERE IS NO IMAGE SUSTAINING THE OBJECT WHICH PROVOKES THE SENSATION OF INFAMY. NO ONE CASTS THE FIRST STONE; YOU ARE A RESPECTABLE CITIZEN AS BEFORE; YOU ENJOY THE HONORS OF THE CITY, THE CONSIDERATION OF YOUR KIND; THE LAWS PROTECT YOU; YOU ARE AS ESTIMABLE AS ANYONE ELSE-—AND YET NO ONE SEES THAT YOU ARE LIVING YOUR FUNERAL IN ADVANCE AND THAT YOUR DEATH CAN ADD NOTHING TO YOUR IRREMEDIABLY ESTABLISHED CONDITION THIS IS BECAUSE THE TRAITOR TO EXISTENCE IS ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO HIMSELF. WHO ELSE CAN ASK HIM FOR AN ACCOUNTING? IF YOU DENOUNCE NEITHER A MAN NOR AN INSTITUTION, YOU RUN NO RISK; NO LAW PROTECTS REALITY, BUT ALL OF THEM PUNISH YOU FOR THE MEREST PREJUDICE AGAINST ITS APPEARANCES. YOU ARE ENTITLED TO SAP BEING ITSELF, BUT NO HUMAN BEING; YOU MAY LEGALLY DEMOLISH THE FOUNDATIONS OF ALL THAT IS, BUT PRISON OR DEATH AWAITS YOUR LEAST INFRINGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL POWERS. NOTHING PROTECTS EXISTENCE: THERE IS NO CASE AGAINST METAPHYSICAL TRAITORS, AGAINST THE BUDDHAS WHO REJECT SALVATION, FOR WE JUDGE THEM TRAITORS ONLY TO THEIR OWN LIVES. YET OF ALL MALEFACTORS, THESE ARE THE MOST HARMFUL: THEY DO NOT ATTACK THE FRUIT, BUT THE VERY SAP OF THE UNIVERSE. THEIR PUNISHMENT? THEY ALONE KNOW WHAT IT IS. . . .

IT MAY BE THAT IN EVERY TRAITOR THERE IS A THIRST FOR OPPROBRIUM, AND THAT HIS CHOICE OF BETRAYAL DEPENDS ON THE DEGREE OF SOLITUDE HE ASPIRES TO. WHO HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THE DESIRE TO PERPETRATE AN INCOMPARABLE CRIME WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE HIM FROM THE HUMAN RACE? WHO HAS NOT COVETED IGNOMINY IN ORDER TO SEVER FOR GOOD THE LINKS WHICH ATTACH HIM TO OTHERS, TO SUFFER A CONDEMNATION WITHOUT APPEAL AND THEREBY TO REACH THE PEACE OF THE ABYSS? AND WHEN WE BREAK WITH THE UNIVERSE, IS IT NOT FOR THE CALM OF AN UNPARDONABLE CRIME? A JUDAS WITH THE SOUL OF A BUDDHA—WHAT A MODEL FOR A COMING AND CONCLUDING HUMANITY!

IN ONE OF THE EARTH’S ATTICS
“I HAVE DREAMED OF DISTANT SPRINGS, OF A SUN SHINING ON NOTHING BUT SEAFOAM AND THE OBLIVION OF MY BIRTH, OF A SUN OPPOSED TO THE EARTH AND TO THIS DISEASE OF FINDING NOTHING ANYWHERE BUT THE DESIRE TO BE SOMEWHERE ELSE THE EARTHLY FATE—-WHO HAS INFLICTED IT UPON US, WHO HAS CHAINED US TO THIS MOROSE MATTER, A PETRIFIED TEAR AGAINST WHICH-—BORN OF TIME—OUR TEARS SHATTER, WHEREAS IT HAS FALLEN, IMMEMORIAL, FROM GOD’S FIRST SHUDDER?

“I HAVE LOATHED THE PLANET’S NOONS AND MIDNIGHTS, I HAVE LONGED FOR A WORLD WITHOUT WEATHER, WITHOUT HOURS AND THE FEAR THAT SWELLS THEM, I HAVE HATED THE SIGHS OF MORTALS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF AGES. WHERE IS THE MOMENT WITHOUT END AND WITHOUT DESIRE, AND THAT PRIMAL VACANCY INSENSITIVE TO THE PRESENTIMENTS OF DISASTER AND OF LIFE? I HAVE SOUGHT FOR THE GEOGRAPHY OF NOTHINGNESS, OF UNKNOWN SEAS AND ANOTHER SUN—PURE OF THE SCANDAL OF LIFE-BEARING RAYS—1 HAVE SOUGHT FOR THE ROCKING OF A SKEPTICAL OCEAN IN WHICH ISLANDS AND AXIOMS ARE DROWNED, THE VAST LIQUID NARCOTIC, TEPID AND SWEET AND TIRED OF KNOWLEDGE. . . .

“THIS EARTH—-SIN OF THE CREATOR! BET I NO LONGER WANT TO EXPIATE OTHERS' SINS. I WANT TO BE CURED OF MY BEGETTING IN AN AGONY OUTSIDE THE CONTINENTS, IN SOME FLUID DESERT, IN AN IMPERSONAL SHIPWRECK.”

INDEFINITE HORROR
IT IS NOT THE OUTBREAK OF A SPECIFIC EVIL WHICH REMINDS US OF OUR FRAGILITY: THERE ARE VAGUER BUT MORE TROUBLESOME WARNINGS TO SIGNIFY OUR IMMINENT EXCOMMUNICATION FROM THE TEMPORAL THE APPROACH OF DISGUST, OF THAT SENSATION WHICH PHYSIOLOGICALLY SEPARATES US FROM THE WORLD, SHOWS HOW DESTRUCTIBLE IS THE SOLIDITY OF OUR INSTINCTS OR THE CONSISTENCY OF OUR ATTACHMENTS. IN HEALTH, OUR FLESH ECHOES THE UNIVERSAL PULSATION AND OUR BLOOD REPRODUCES ITS CADENCE; IN DISGUST, WHICH LIES IN WAIT FOR US LIKE A POTENTIAL HELL IN ORDER TO SUDDENLY SEIZE UPON US AFTERWARDS, WE ARE AS ISOLATED IN THE WHOLE AS A MONSTER IMAGINED BY SOME TERATOLOGY OF SOLITUDE.

THE CRITICAL POINT OF OUR VITALITY IS NOT DISEASE—WHICH IS STRUGGLE—BUT THAT INDEFINITE HORROR WHICH REJECTS EVERYTHING AND STRIPS OUR DESIRES OF THE POWER TO PROCREATE NEW MISTAKES. THE SENSES LOSE THEIR SAP, THE VEINS DRY UP, AND THE ORGANS NO LONGER PERCEIVE ANYTHING BUT THE INTERVAL SEPARATING THEM FROM THEIR OWN FUNCTIONS. EVERYTHING TURNS INSIPID: PROVENDER AND DREAMS. NO MORE AROMA IN MATTER AND NO MORE ENIGMA IN MEDITATION; GASTRONOMY AND METAPHYSICS BOTH BECOME VICTIMS OF OUR WANT OF APPETITE. WE SPEND HOURS WAITING FOR OTHER HOURS, WAITING FOR THE MOMENTS WHICH NO LONGER FLEE TIME, THE FAITHFUL MOMENTS WHICH REINSTATE US IN THE MEDIOCRITY OF HEALTH . . . AND THE AMNESIA OF ITS DANGERS.

(GREED FOR SPACE, UNCONSCIOUS COVETOUSNESS OF THE FUTURE, HEALTH SHOWS US HOW SUPERFICIAL THE LEVEL OF LIFE IS AS SUCH, AND HOW INCOMPATIBLE ORGANIC EQUILIBRIUM IS WITH INNER DEPTH.

THE MIND, IN ITS RANGE, PROCEEDS FROM OUR COMPROMISED FUNCTIONS: IT TAKES WING INSOFAR AS THE VOID DILATES WITHIN OUR ORGANS. WE ARE HEALTHY ONLY INSOFAR AS WE ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY OURSELVES: IT IS OUR DISGUSTS WHICH INDIVIDUALIZE US; OUR MELANCHOLIES WHICH GRANT US A NAME; OUR LOSSES WHICH MAKE US POSSESSORS OF OUR . . . SELF. WE ARE OURSELVES ONLY BY THE SUM OF OUR FAILURES.)

UNCONSCIOUS DOGMAS
WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PENETRATE SOMEONE’S MISTAKE, TO SHOW HIM THE INANITY OF HIS PLANS AND INTENTIONS; BUT HOW WREST HIM FROM HIS PERSISTENCE IN TIME, WHEN HE CONCEALS A FANATICISM AS INVETERATE AS HIS INSTINCTS, AS OLD AS HIS PREJUDICES? WE BEAR WITHIN US—LIKE AN UNCHALLENGEABLE TREASURE—AN AMALGAM OF UNWORTHY BELIEFS AND CERTITUDES. AND EVEN THE MAN WHO MANAGES TO RID HIMSELF OF THEM, TO VANQUISH THEM, REMAINS—IN THE DESERT OF HIS LUCIDITY—A FANATIC STILL: A FANATIC OF HIMSELF, OF HIS OWN EXISTENCE; HE HAS SCOURED ALL HIS OBSESSIONS, EXCEPT FOR THE TERRAIN WHERE THEY FLOURISH; HE HAS LOST ALL HIS FIXED POINTS, EXCEPT FOR THE FIXITY FROM WHICH THEY PROCEED. LIFE HAS DOGMAS MORE IMMUTABLE THAN THEOLOGY, EACH EXISTENCE BEING ANCHORED IN INFALLIBILITIES WHICH EXCEED ALL THE LUCUBRATIONS OF MADNESS OR OF FAITH. EVEN THE SKEPTIC, IN LOVE WITH HIS DOUBTS, TURNS OUT TO BE A FANATIC OF SKEPTICISM. MAN IS THE DOGMATIC BEING PAR EXCELLENCE; AND HIS DOGMAS ARE ALL THE DEEPER WHEN HE DOES NOT FORMULATE THEM, WHEN HE IS UNAWARE OF THEM, AND WHEN HE FOLLOWS THEM.

WE ALL BELIEVE IN MANY MORE THINGS THAN WE THINK, WE HARBOR INTOLERANCES, WE CHERISH BLOODY PREJUDICES, AND, DEFENDING OUR IDEAS WITH EXTREME MEANS, WE TRAVEL THE WORLD LIKE AMBULATORY AND IRREFRAGABLE FORTRESSES. EACH OF US IS A SUPREME DOGMA TO HIMSELF; NO THEOLOGY PROTECTS ITS GOD AS WE PROTECT OUR SELF; AND IF WE ASSAIL THIS SELF WITH DOUBTS AND CALL IT INTO QUESTION, WE DO SO ONLY BY A PSEUDO-ELEGANCE OF OUR PRIDE: THE CASE IS ALREADY WON.

HOW ESCAPE THE ABSOLUTE OF ONESELF? ONE WOULD HAVE TO IMAGINE A BEING WITHOUT INSTINCTS, WITHOUT A NAME, AND TO WHOM HIS OWN IMAGE WOULD BE UNKNOWN. BUT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD GIVES US BACK OUR OWN FEATURES; NIGHT ITSELF IS NEVER DARK ENOUGH TO KEEP US FROM BEING REFLECTED IN IT. TOO PRESENT TO OURSELVES, OUR NON-EXISTENCE BEFORE BIRTH AND AFTER DEATH INFLUENCES US ONLY AS A NOTION AND ONLY FOR A FEW MOMENTS; WE EXPERIENCE THE FEVER OF OUR DURATION AS AN ETERNITY WHICH FALTERS BUT WHICH NONETHELESS REMAINS UNEXHAUSTIBLE IN ITS PRINCIPLE.

THE MAN WHO DOES NOT ADORE HIMSELF IS YET TO BE BORN. EVERYTHING THAT LIVES LOVES ITSELF; IF NOT, WHAT WOULD BE THE SOURCE OF THE DREAD WHICH BREAKS OUT IN THE DEPTHS AND ON THE SURFACES OF LIFE? EACH OF US IS, FOR HIMSELF, THE ONE FIXED POINT IN THE UNIVERSE. AND IF SOMEONE DIES FOR AN IDEA, IT IS BECAUSE IT IS HIS IDEA, AND HIS IDEA IS HIS LIFE.

NO CRITIQUE OF ANY KIND OF REASON WILL WAKEN MAN FROM HIS “DOGMATIC SLEEP.” IT MAY SHAKE THE UNCONSCIOUS CERTITUDES WHICH ABOUND IN HIS PHILOSOPHY AND SUBSTITUTE MORE FLEXIBLE PROPOSITIONS FOR HIS RIGID AFFIRMATIONS, BUT HOW, BY A RATIONAL PROCEDURE, WILL IT MANAGE TO SHAKE THE CREATURE, HUDDLED OVER ITS OWN DOGMAS, WITHOUT BRINGING ABOUT ITS VERY DEATH?

DUALITY
THERE IS A VULGARITY WHICH MAKES US ADMIT ANYTHING IN THIS WORLD, BUT WHICH IS NOT POWERFUL ENOUGH TO MAKE US ADMIT THIS WORLD ITSELF HENCE WE CAN ENDURE LIFE’S MISERIES EVEN AS WE REPUDIATE LIFE, LET OURSELVES BE SWEPT AWAY BY THE FRENZIES OF DESIRE EVEN AS WE REJECT DESIRE. IN THE ASSENT TO EXISTENCE THERE IS A KIND OF BASENESS, WHICH WE ESCAPE BY MEANS OF OUR PRIDES AND OUR REGRETS, BUT PARTICULARLY BY MEANS OF THE MELANCHOLY WHICH KEEPS US FROM SLIDING INTO A FINAL AFFIRMATION, WRESTED FROM OUR COWARDICE. IS ANYTHING VILER THAN TO SAY YES TO THE WORLD? AND YET WE KEEP MULTIPLYING THAT CONSENT, THAT TRIVIAL REPETITION, THAT LOYALTY OATH TO LIFE, DENIED ONLY BY EVERYTHING IN US THAT REJECTS VULGARITY.

WE CAN LIVE THE WAY THE OTHERS DO AND YET CONCEAL A ' W GREATER THAN THE WORLD: THAT IS MELANCHOLY’S INFINITY. . . .

(WE CAN LOVE ONLY THE BEINGS WHO DO NOT EXCEED THE MINIMUM OF VULGARITY INDISPENSABLE FOR LIFE ITSELF. YET IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DELIMIT THE QUANTITY OF SUCH VULGARITY, ESPECIALLY SINCE NO ACTION CAN DO WITHOUT IT. ALL OF LIFE’S REJECTS PROVE THAT THEY WERE INSUFFICIENTLY SORDID. . . . THE MAN WHO PREVAILS IN THE CONFLICT WITH HIS NEIGHBORS STANDS ON TOP OF A DUNGHEAP; AND THE MAN WHO IS VANQUISHED THERE PAYS FOR A PURITY HE HAS BEEN UNWILLING TO SULLY. IN EVERY MAN, NOTHING IS MORE ALIVE AND TRUE THAN HIS OWN VULGARITY, SOURCE OF ALL THAT IS VITAL IN ELEMENTAL TERMS. BUT, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE MORE DEEPLY ROOTED YOU ARE IN LIFE, THE MORE CONTEMPTIBLE YOU ARE. THE MAN WHO DOES NOT SPREAD A VAGUE FUNEREAL RADIATION AROUND HIMSELF, AND WHO IN PASSING FAILS TO LEAVE A WHIFF OF MELANCHOLY FROM REMOTE WORLDS—THAT MAN BELONGS TO SUB-ZOOLOGY, MORE SPECIFICALLY TO HUMAN HISTORY.

THE OPPOSITION BETWEEN VULGARITY AND MELANCHOLY IS SO IRREDUCIBLE THAT NEXT TO IT ALL OTHER OPPOSITIONS SEEM TO BE INVENTIONS OF THE MIND, ARBITRARY AND ENTERTAINING; EVEN THE MOST DECISIVE ANTIMONIES BLUR BESIDE THIS OPPOSITION IN WHICH ARE BROUGHT FACE TO FACE—ACCORDING TO A PREDESTINED DOSAGE—OUR LOWER DEPTHS AND OUR DREAMING GALL.)

THE RENEGADE
HE REMEMBERS BEING BORN SOMEWHERE, HAVING BELIEVED IN NATIVE ERRORS, HAVING PROPOSED PRINCIPLES AND PREACHED INFLAMMATORY STUPIDITIES. HE BLUSHES FOR IT . . . AND STRIVES TO ABJURE HIS PAST, HIS REAL OR IMAGINARY FATHERLANDS, THE TRUTHS GENERATED IN HIS VERY MARROW. HE WILL FIND PEACE ONLY AFTER HAVING ANNIHILATED IN HIMSELF THE LAST REFLEX OF THE CITIZEN, THE LAST INHERITED ENTHUSIASM. HOW COULD THE HEART’S HABITS STILL CHAIN HIM, WHEN HE SEEKS LIBERATION FROM GENEALOGIES AND WHEN EVEN THE IDEAL OF THE ANCIENT SAGE, SCORNER OF ALL CITIES, SEEMS TO HIM A COMPROMISE? THE MAN WHO CAN NO LONGER TAKE SIDES BECAUSE ALL MEN ARE NECESSARILY RIGHT AND WRONG, BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS AT ONCE JUSTIFIED AND IRRATIONAL-—THAT MAN MUST RENOUNCE HIS OWN NAME, TREAD HIS IDENTITY UNDERFOOT, AND BEGIN A NEW LIFE IN IMPASSIBILITY OR DESPAIR. OR OTHERWISE, INVENT ANOTHER GENRE OF SOLITUDE, EXPATRIATE HIMSELF IN THE VOID, AND PURSUE—BY MEANS OF ONE EXILE OR ANOTHER—THE STAGES OF UPROOTEDNESS. RELEASED FROM ALL PREJUDICES, HE BECOMES THE UNUSABLE MAN PAR EXCELLENCE, TO WHOM NO ONE TURNS AND WHOM NO ONE FEARS BECAUSE HE ADMITS AND REPUDIATES EVERYTHING WITH THE SAME DETACHMENT. LESS DANGEROUS THAN A HEEDLESS INSECT, HE IS NONETHELESS A SCOURGE FOR LIFE, FOR IT HAS VANISHED FROM HIS VOCABULARY, WITH THE SEVEN DAYS OF THE CREATION. AND LIFE WOULD FORGIVE HIM, IF AT LEAST HE RELISHED CHAOS, WHICH IS WHERE LIFE BEGAN. BUT HE DENIES THE FEVERISH ORIGINS, BEGINNING WITH HIS OWN, AND PRESERVES, WITH REGARD TO THE WORLD, ONLY A COLD MEMORY, A POLITE REGRET.

(FROM DENIAL TO DENIAL, HIS EXISTENCE IS DIMINISHED: VAGUER AND MORE UNREAL THAN A SYLLOGISM OF SIGHS, HOW COULD HE STILL BE A CREATURE OF FLESH AND BLOOD? ANEMIC, HE RIVALS THE IDEA ITSELF; HE HAS ABSTRACTED HIMSELF FROM HIS ANCESTORS, FROM HIS FRIENDS, FROM EVERY SOUL AND HIMSELF; IN HIS VEINS, ONCE TURBULENT, RESTS A LIGHT FROM ANOTHER WORLD. LIBERATED FROM WHAT HE HAS LIVED, UNCONCERNED BY WHAT HE WILL LIVE, HE DEMOLISHES THE SIGNPOSTS ON ALL HIS ROADS, AND WRESTS HIMSELF FROM THE DIALS OF ALL TIME. “I SHALL NEVER MEET MYSELF AGAIN,” HE DECIDES, HAPPY TO TURN HIS LAST HATRED AGAINST HIMSELF, HAPPIER STILL TO ANNIHILATE—IN HIS FORGIVENESS— ALL BEINGS, ALL THINGS.)

SHADES OF THE FUTURE
WE ARE JUSTIFIED IN IMAGINING A TIME WHEN WE SHALL HAVE TRANSCENDED EVERYTHING, EVEN MUSIC, EVEN POETRY, A TIME WHEN, DETRACTORS OF OUR TRADITIONS AND OUR TRANSPORTS, WE SHALL ACHIEVE SUCH A DISAVOWAL OF OURSELVES THAT, WEARY OF A KNOWN GRAVE, WE SHALL MAKE OUR WAY THROUGH THE DAYS IN A THREADBARE SHROUD. WHEN A SONNET, WHOSE RIGOR RAISES THE VERBAL WORLD ABOVE A SPLENDIDLY IMAGINED COSMOS—WHEN A SONNET CEASES TO BE A TEMPTATION FOR OUR TEARS, AND WHEN IN THE MIDDLE OF A SONATA OUR YAWNS WIN OUT OVER OUR EMOTION, THEN THE GRAVEYARDS WILL HAVE NOTHING MORE TO DO WITH US, FOR THEY RECEIVE ONLY FRESH CORPSES, STILL IMBUED WITH A SUSPICION OF WARMTH AND A MEMORY OF LIFE.

BEFORE OUR OLD AGE A TIME WILL COME WHEN, RETRACING OUR ARDORS, AND BENT BENEATH THE RECANTATIONS OF THE FLESH, WE SHALL WALK, HALF-CARRION, HALF-SPECTER. . . . WE SHALL HAVE REPRESSED—OUT OF FEAR OF COMPLICITY WITH ILLUSION—ANY PALPITATION WITHIN US. UNABLE TO HAVE DISEMBODIED OUR LIFE IN A SONNET, WE SHALL DRAG OUR CORRUPTION IN SHREDS AND TATTERS, AND FOR HAVING OUTSTRIPPED MUSIC AND DEATH ALIKE, WE SHALL STUMBLE, BLIND, TOWARD A FUNEREAL IMMORTALITY. . . .

THE FLOWER OF FIXED IDEAS
SO LONG AS MAN IS PROTECTED BY MADNESS, HE FUNCTIONS AND FLOURISHES; BUT WHEN HE FREES HIMSELF FROM THE FRUITFUL TYRANNY OF FIXED IDEAS, HE IS LOST, RUINED. HE BEGINS TO ACCEPT EVERYTHING, TO WRAP NOT ONLY MINOR ABUSES IN HIS TOLERANCE, BUT CRIMES AND MONSTROSITIES, VICES AND ABERRATIONS: EVERYTHING IS WORTH THE SAME TO HIM. HIS INDULGENCE, SELF-DESTROYING AS IT IS, EXTENDS TO ALL THE GUILTY, TO THE VICTIMS AND THE EXECUTIONERS; HE TAKES ALL SIDES, BECAUSE HE ESPOUSES ALL OPINIONS; GELATINOUS, CONTAMINATED BY INFINITY, HE HAS LOST HIS “CHARACTER,” LACKING ANY POINT OF REFERENCE, ANY OBSESSION. THE UNIVERSAL VIEW MELTS THINGS INTO A BLUR, AND THE MAN WHO STILL MAKES THEM OUT, BEING NEITHER THEIR FRIEND NOR THEIR ENEMY, BEARS IN HIMSELF A WAX HEART WHICH INDISCRIMINATELY TAKES THE FORM OF OBJECTS AND BEINGS. HIS PITY IS ADDRESSED TO . . . EXISTENCE, AND HIS CHARITY IS THAT OF DOUBT AND NOT THAT OF LOVE; A SKEPTICAL CHARITY, CONSEQUENCE OF KNOWLEDGE, WHICH EXCUSES ALL ANOMALIES. BUT THE MAN WHO TAKES SIDES, WHO LIVES IN THE FOLLY OF DECISION AND CHOICE, IS NEVER CHARITABLE; INCAPABLE OF COMPREHENDING ALL POINTS OF VIEW, CONFINED IN THE HORIZON OF HIS DESIRES AND HIS PRINCIPLES, HE PLUNGES INTO A HYPNOSIS OF THE FINITE. THIS IS BECAUSE CREATURES FLOURISH ONLY BY TURNING THEIR BACKS ON THE UNIVERSAL . . . TO BE SOMETHING—UNCONDITIONAL—-IS ALWAYS A FORM OF MADNESS FROM WHICH LIFE—FLOWER OF FIXED IDEA—FREES ITSELF ONLY TO FADE.

THE “CELESTIAL DOG”
UNKNOWABLE, WHAT A MAN MUST LOSE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT THE CONVENTIONS—UNKNOWABLE WHAT DIOGENES LOST TO BECOME THE MAN WHO PERMITTED HIMSELF EVERYTHING, WHO TRANSLATED HIS INNERMOST THOUGHTS INTO ACTIONS WITH A SUPERNATURAL INSOLENCE, LIKE SOME LIBIDINOUS YET PURE GOD OF KNOWLEDGE. NO ONE WAS SO FRANK; A LIMIT CASE OF SINCERITY AND LUCIDITY AS WELL AS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WE COULD BE IF EDUCATION AND HYPOCRISY DID NOT REIN IN OUR DESIRES AND OUR GESTURES.

“ONE DAY A MAN INVITED HIM INTO A RICHLY FURNISHED HOUSE, SAYING 'BE CAREFUL NOT TO SPIT ON THE FLOOR.' DIOGENES, WHO NEEDED TO SPIT, SPAT IN HIS FACE, EXCLAIMING THAT IT WAS THE ONLY DIRTY PLACE HE COULD FIND WHERE SPITTING WAS PERMITTED."—DIOGENES LAÈRTIUS.

WHO, AFTER BEING RECEIVED BY A RICH MAN, HAS NOT LONGED OCEANS OF SALIVA TO EXPECTORATE ON ALL THE OWNERS OF THE EARTH? AND WHO HAS NOT SWALLOWED HIS OWN SPITTLE FOR FEAR OF CASTING IT IN THE FACE OF SOME STOUT AND RESPECTED THIEF?

WE ARE ALL ABSURDLY PRUDENT AND TIMID: CYNICISM IS NOT SOMETHING WE ARE TAUGHT IN SCHOOL. NOR IS PRIDE.

“MENIPPUS, IN HIS WORK ENTITLED THE VIRTUE OF DIOGENES, TELLS HOW HE WAS CAPTURED AND SOLD AS A SLAVE, AND THAT HE WAS ASKED WHAT HE KNEW HOW TO DO. DIOGENES ANSWERED: 'COMMAND!' AND SHOUTED TO THE HERALD: 'ASK WHO WANTS TO BUY A MASTER.'”

THE MAN WHO AFFRONTED ALEXANDER AND PLATO, WHO MASTURBATED IN THE MARKETPLACE ("IF ONLY HEAVEN LET US RUB OUR BELLIES TOO, AND THAT BE ENOUGH TO STAVE OFF HUNGER!"), THE MAN OF THE FAMOUS CASK AND THE FAMOUS LANTERN, AND WHO IN HIS YOUTH WAS A COUNTERFEITER (WHAT HIGHER DIGNITY FOR A CYNIC?), WHAT MUST HIS EXPERIENCE HAVE BEEN OF HIS NEIGHBORS? CERTAINLY OUR OWN, YET WITH THIS DIFFERENCE: THAT MAN WAS THE SOLE SUBSTANCE OF HIS REFLECTION AND HIS CONTEMPT. WITHOUT SUFFERING THE FALSIFICATIONS OF ANY ETHIC AND ANY METAPHYSIC, HE STROVE TO STRIP MAN IN ORDER TO SHOW HIM TO US NAKEDER AND MORE ABOMINABLE THAN ANY COMEDY, ANY APOCALYPSE HAS DONE.

“SOCRATES GONE MAD,” PLATO CALLED HIM—SOCRATES TURNED SINCERE IS WHAT HE SHOULD HAVE SAID, SOCRATES RENOUNCING THE GOOD ABJURING FORMULAS AND THE CITY, SOCRATES TURNING, FINALLY, INTO A PSYCHOLOGIST AND NOTHING MORE. BUT SOCRATES—EVEN SUBLIME—REMAINS CONVENTIONAL; HE REMAINS A MASTER AN EDIFYING MODEL ONLY DIOGENES PROPOSES NOTHING; THE BASIS OF HIS ATTITUDE—AND OF CYNICISM IN ITS ESSENCE—IS DETERMINED BY A TESTICULAR HORROR OF THE ABSURDITY OF BEING MAN.

THE THINKER WHO REFLECTS WITHOUT ILLUSION UPON HUMAN REALITY, IF HE WANTS TO REMAIN WITHIN THE WORLD, AND IF HE ELIMINATES MYSTICISM AS AN ESCAPE-HATCH, ENDS UP WITH A VISION IN WHICH ARE MINGLED WISDOM, BITTERNESS, AND FARCE; AND IF HE CHOOSES THE MARKETPLACE AS THE SITE OF HIS SOLITUDE, HE MUSTERS HIS VERVE IN MOCKING HIS “KIND” OR IN EXHIBITING HIS DISGUST, A DISGUST WHICH TODAY, WITH CHRISTIANITY AND THE POLICE, WE CAN NO LONGER PERMIT OURSELVES. TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF OATHS AND CODES HAVE SWEETENED OUR BILE; MOREOVER, IN A HURRIED WORLD, WHO WOULD STOP TO ANSWER OUR INSOLENCES, TO DELIGHT IN OUR HOWLS?

THAT THE GREATEST CONNOISSEUR OF HUMAN BEINGS SHOULD HAVE BEEN NICKNAMD “DOG” PROVES THAT MAN HAS NEVER HAD THE COURAGE TO ACCEPT HIS AUTHENTIC IMAGE AND THAT HE HAS ALWAYS REJECTED TRUTHS WITHOUT ACCOMMODATIONS. DIOGENES SUPPRESSED POSE IN HIMSELF. WHAT A MONSTER IN OTHER MEN’S EYES! TO HAVE AN HONORABLE PLACE IN PHILOSOPHY YOU MUST BE AN ACTOR, YOU MUST RESPECT THE PLAY OF IDEAS AND EXERCISE YOURSELF OVER FALSE PROBLEMS. IN NO CASE MUST MAN AS SUCH BE YOUR BUSINESS. AGAIN, ACCORDING TO DIOGENES LAËRTIUS: “AT THE OLYMPIC GAMES, WHEN THE HERALD PROCLAIMED: ‘DIOXIPPUS HAS VANQUISHED MEN!’ DIOGENES ANSWERED: 'HE HAS VANQUISHED ONLY SLAVES—MEN ARE MY BUSINESS/ “ AND INDEED HE VANQUISHED MEN AS NO ONE ELSE HAS EVER DONE, WITH WEAPONS MORE DREADFUL THAN THOSE OF CONQUERORS, THOUGH HE OWNED ONLY A BROOM, THE LEAST PROPRIETARY OF ALL BEGGARS, TRUE SAINT OF MOCKERY.

BY A LUCKY ACCIDENT, HE WAS BORN BEFORE THE CROSS MADE ITS APPEARANCE. WHO KNOWS IF, GRAFTED ON HIS DETACHMENT, SOME UNHEALTHY TEMPTATION OF EXTRA-HUMAN RISK MIGHT NOT HAVE INDUCED HIM TO BECOME AN ORDINARY ASCETIC, LATER CANONIZED, LOST IN THE MASS OF THE BLESSED AND THE MAZE OF THE CALENDAR? THEN HE WOULD HAVE GONE MAD, HE TOO, THE MOST PROFOUNDLY NORMAL OF MEN, SINCE HE WAS REMOTE FROM ALL TEACHING AND ALL DOCTRINE. THE HIDEOUS COUNTENANCE OF MAN—DIOGENES WAS THE ONLY ONE TO REVEAL THAT TO US. THE MERITS OF CYNICISM HAVE BEEN DIMMED AND DOWNTRODDEN BY A RELIGION OPPOSED TO THE EVIDENT. BUT THE MOMENT HAS COME TO CONFRONT THE TRUTHS OF THE SON OF GOD WITH THOSE OF THIS “CELESTIAL DOG,” AS A POET OF HIS TIME CALLED HIM.

AMBIGUITY OF GENIUS
ALL INSPIRATION PROCEEDS FROM A FACULTY OF EXAGGERATION: LYRICISM—AND THE WHOLE WORLD OF METAPHOR—WOULD BE A PITIABLE EXCITATION WITHOUT THAT RAPTURE WHICH DILATES WORDS UNTIL THEY BURST. WHEN THE ELEMENTS OR THE DIMENSIONS OF THE COSMOS SEEM TOO DIMINISHED TO SERVE AS TERMS OF COMPARISON FOR OUR CONDITIONS, POETRY NEEDS—IN ORDER TO TRANSCEND ITS STAGE OF VIRTUALITY AND IMMINENCE—ONLY A LITTLE CLARITY IN THE FLASHES WHICH PREFIGURE AND BEGET IT. NO TRUE INSPIRATION FAILS TO RISE OUT OF THE ANOMALY OF A SOUL VASTER THAN THE WORLD. . . . IN THE VERBAL CONFLAGRATION OF A SHAKESPEARE AND A SHELLEY WE SMELL THE ASH OF WORDS, BACKWASH AND EFFLUVIUM OF AN IMPOSSIBLE COSMOGONY. THE TERMS ENCROACH UPON EACH OTHER, AS THOUGH NONE COULD ATTAIN THE EQUIVALENT OF THE INNER DILATION; THIS IS THE HERNIA OF THE IMAGE, THE TRANSCENDENT RUPTURE OF POOR WORDS, BORN OF EVERYDAY USE AND MIRACULOUSLY RAISED TO THE HEART’S ALTITUDES. THE TRUTHS OF BEAUTY ARE FED ON EXAGGERATIONS WHICH, UPON THE MEREST ANALYSIS, TURN OUT TO BE MONSTROUS AND MEANINGLESS. POETRY: DEMIURGICAL DIVAGATION OF THE VOCABULARY. . . . HAS CHARLATANISM EVER BEEN MORE EFFECTIVELY COMBINED WITH ECSTASY? LYING, THE WELLSPRING OF ALL TEARS! SUCH IS THE IMPOSTURE OF GENIUS AND THE SECRET OF ART. TRIFLES SWOLLEN TO THE HEAVENS; THE IMPROBABLE, GENERATOR OF A UNIVERSE! IN EVERY GENIUS COEXISTS A BRAGGART AND A GOD.

IDOLATRY OF DISASTER
ALL THAT WE BUILD BEYOND RAW EXISTENCE, ALL THE MANY POWERS WHICH GIVE THE WORLD A PHYSIOGNOMY, WE OWE TO MISFORTUNE—ARCHITECT OF DIVERSITY, INTELLIGIBLE INSTRUMENT OF OUR ACTIONS. WHAT ITS SPHERE FAILS TO ENGROSS TRANSCENDS US: WHAT MEANING COULD AN EVENT HAVE WHICH FAILS TO BE OVERWHELMING? THE FUTURE AWAITS US IN ORDER TO IMMOLATE US: THE MIND RECORDS NOTHING BUT THE FRACTURE OF EXISTENCE NOW, AND THE SENSES STILL VIBRATE ONLY IN THE EXPECTATION OF DISASTER. . . . HOW AVOID CONSIDERING THE FATE OF CHATEAUBRIAND’S SISTER LUCILE, OR OF KAROLINE VON GÜNDERODE, AND MURMURING WITH THE FORMER: “I SHALL FALL INTO THE SLEEP OF DEATH UPON MY DESTINY,” OR GULPING THE LATTER’S DESPAIR WHICH PLUNGED A DAGGER INTO HER HEART? APART FROM A FEW EXAMPLES OF EXHAUSTIVE MELANCHOLY, AND A FEW UNEQUALED SUICIDES, MEN ARE MERELY PUPPETS STUFFED WITH RED GLOBULES IN ORDER TO BEGET HISTORY AND ITS GRIMACES.

WHEN, IDOLATERS OF DISASTER, WE MAKE IT THE AGENT AND THE SUBSTANCE OF BECOMING, WE BATHE IN THE LIMPIDITY OF THE PRESCRIBED FATE, IN A DAWN OF CATASTROPHES, IN A FRUITFUL GEHENNA. . . . BUT WHEN, IMAGINING WE HAVE EXHAUSTED IT, WE FEAR WE SHALL OUTLIVE IT, EXISTENCE DARKENS AND NO LONGER BECOMES. AND WE DREAD READAPTING OURSELVES TO HOPE . . . BETRAYING OUR DISASTER, BETRAYING OURSELVES. . . .

THE DEMON
HE IS THERE, IN THE BLOOD’S INFERNO, IN THE BITTERNESS OF EACH CELL, IN THE SHUDDER OF OUR NERVES, IN THOSE CONTRARY PRAYERS EXHALED BY HATE, EVERYWHERE WHERE HE MAKES, OUT OF HORROR, HIS COMFORT. SHOULD I LET HIM UNDERMINE MY HOURS, WHEN AS A METICULOUS ACCOMPLICE OF MY DESTRUCTION I COULD VOMIT UP MY HOPES AND DESIST FROM MYSELF? HE SHARES—MURDEROUS TENANT—MY BED, MY OBLIVIONS, AND MY INSOMNIAS; TO LOSE HIM, MY OWN LOSS IS NECESSARY. AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONLY A BODY AND A SOUL, THE ONE TOO HEAVY AND THE OTHER TOO DIM, HOW BEAR AS WELL AN ADDITIONAL WEIGHT, A FURTHER DARKNESS? HOW DRAG YOUR WAY THROUGH A DARK TIME? I DREAM OF A GOLDEN MOMENT OUTSIDE OF BECOMING, A SUNLIT MOMENT TRANSCENDING THE TORMENT OF THE ORGANS AND THE MELODY OF THEIR DECOMPOSITION.

TO HEAR THE SOBS—AGONIZED, JOYOUS—OF THAT EVIL ONE WHO WRIGGLES THROUGH YOUR THOUGHTS, AND NOT TO STRANGLE THE INTRUDER? BUT IF YOU ATTACK HIM, IT WILL ONLY BE OUT OF SOME FUTILE SELF-INDULGENCE. HE IS ALREADY YOUR PSEUDONYM; YOU CANNOT DO HIM VIOLENCE WITHOUT IMPUNITY. WHY EVADE THE APPROACH OF THE LAST ACT? WHY NOT ATTACK YOURSELF IN YOUR OWN NAME?

(IT WOULD BE QUITE FALSE TO SUPPOSE THAT THE DEMONIAC “REVELATION” IS A PRESENCE INSEPARABLE FROM OUR DURATION; YET WHEN WE ARE GRIPPED BY IT, WE CANNOT IMAGINE THE QUANTITY OF NEUTRAL MOMENTS WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH BEFORE. TO INVOKE THE DEVIL IS TO TINGE WITH A VESTIGE OF THEOLOGY AN AMBIGUOUS EXCITATION WHICH OUR PRIDE REFUSES TO ACCEPT AS SUCH. BUT WHO DOES NOT KNOW THESE FEARS, IN WHICH WE FIND OURSELVES FACE TO FACE WITH THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS? OUR PRIDE NEEDS A NAME, A GREAT NAME IN ORDER TO BAPTIZE AN ANGUISH WHICH WOULD BE PITIABLE IF IT EMANATED ONLY FROM PHYSIOLOGY. THE TRADITIONAL EXPLANATION SEEMS MORE FLATTERING TO US; A RESIDUE OF METAPHYSICS SUITS THE MIND. . . .

IT IS IN THIS WAY THAT—IN ORDER TO VEIL OUR TOO IMMEDIATE ILLS—WE RESORT TO ELEGANT, ALTHOUGH OBSOLETE, ENTITIES. HOW ADMIT THAT OUR MOST MYSTERIOUS DELIRIUMS PROCEED FROM NO MORE THAN NERVOUS DISEASES, WHEREAS IT IS ENOUGH FOR US TO THINK OF THE DEMON IN US OR OUTSIDE US IN ORDER TO STAND UP STRAIGHT AGAIN AT ONCE? WE INHERIT FROM OUR ANCESTORS THAT PROPENSITY TO OBJECTIVIZE OUR INMOST EVILS; MYTHOLOGY HAS IMPREGNATED OUR BLOOD AND LITERATURE HAS SUSTAINED IN US A RELISH FOR EFFECTS. . . .)

THE MOCKERY OF A “NEW LIFE”
NAILED TO OURSELVES, WE LACK THE CAPACITY OF LEAVING THE PATH INSCRIBED IN THE INNATENESS OF OUR DESPAIR. EXEMPT OURSELVES FROM LIFE BECAUSE IT IS NOT OUR ELEMENT? NO ONE HANDS OUT DIPLOMAS OF NON-EXISTENCE. WE MUST PERSEVERE IN BREATHING, FEEL THE AIR BURN OUR LIPS, ACCUMULATE REGRETS AT THE HEART OF A REALITY WHICH WE HAVE NOT HOPED FOR, AND RENOUNCE GIVING AN EXPLANATION FOR THE DISEASE WHICH BRINGS ABOUT OUR DOWNFALL. WHEN EACH MOMENT OF TIME RUSHES UPON US LIKE A DAGGER, WHEN OUR FLESH, INSTIGATED BY OUR DESIRES, REFUSES TO BE PETRIFIED—HOW CONFRONT A SINGLE MOMENT ADDED TO OUR FATE? WITH THE HELP OF WHAT ARTIFICES MIGHT WE FIND THE STRENGTH OF ILLUSION TO GO IN SEARCH OF ANOTHER LIFE—A NEW LIFE?

IT IS BECAUSE ALL MEN WHO CAST A GLANCE OVER THEIR PAST RUINS IMAGINE—IN ORDER TO AVOID THE RUINS TO COME—THAT IT IS IN THEIR POWER TO RECOMMENCE SOMETHING RADICALLY NEW. THEY MAKE THEMSELVES A SOLEMN PROMISE, WAITING FOR A MIRACLE WHICH WOULD EXTRICATE THEM FROM THIS AVERAGE ABYSS INTO WHICH FATE HAS PLUNGED THEM. BUT NOTHING HAPPENS. THEY ALL CONTINUE TO BE THE SAME, MODIFIED ONLY BY THE ACCENTUATION OF THIS TENDENCY TO DECLINE WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTERISTIC. WE SEE AROUND US ONLY DILAPIDATED INSPIRATIONS AND ARDORS: EVERY MAN PROMISES EVERYTHING, BUT EVERY MAN LIVES TO KNOW THE FRAGILITY OF HIS SPARK AND LIFE’S LACK OF GENIUS IN HIS LIFE. THE AUTHENTICITY OF AN EXISTENCE CONSISTS IN ITS OWN RAIN. THE CROWN OF OUR BECOMING: A PATH THAT LOOKS GLORIOUS AND WHICH LEADS TO A ROUT; THE GARLAND OF OUR GIFTS: CAMOUFLAGE OF OUR GANGRENE. . . . UNDER THE SUN TRIUMPHS A CARRION SPRING; BEAUTY ITSELF IS MERELY DEATH PREENING AMONG THE BUDS. . . .

I HAVE KNOWN NO “NEW” LIFE WHICH WAS NOT ILLUSORY AND COMPROMISED AT ITS ROOTS. I HAVE SEEN EACH MAN ADVANCE INTO TIME TO BE ISOLATED IN AN ANGUISHED RUMINATION AND TO FALL BACK INTO HIMSELF WITH, AS THE SIGN OF RENEWAL, THE UNFORESEEN GRIMACE OF HIS OWN HOPES.

TRIPLE IMPASSE
THE MIND DISCOVERS IDENTITY; THE SOUL, ENNUI; THE BODY, SLOTH. IT IS ONE AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE OF INVARIABILITY, DIFFERENTLY EXPRESSED UNDER THE THREE FORMS OF THE UNIVERSAL YAWN.

THE MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE JUSTIFIES THE RATIONALISTS' THESIS; IT SHOWS US A LEGAL UNIVERSE IN WHICH EVERYTHING IS ANTICIPATED AND ADJUSTED; THE BARBARISM OF NO SURPRISE COMES TO TROUBLE ITS HARMONY. IF THE SAME MIND DISCOVERS CONTRADICTION, THE SAME SOUL, DELIRIUM, THE SAME BODY, FRENZY, IT IS IN ORDER TO BEGET NEW UNREALITIES, TO ESCAPE A UNIVERSE TOO DEMONSTRABLY THE SAME; AND IT IS THE ANTI-RATIONALISTS’ THESIS WHICH PREVAILS. THE FLOWERING OF ABSURDITIES REVEALS AN EXISTENCE BEFORE WHICH ALL CLARITY OF VISION SEEMS MOCKINGLY POOR. THIS IS THE PERPETUAL AGGRESSION OF THE UNFORESEEABLE.

BETWEEN THESE TWO TENDENCIES, MAN WIELDS HIS AMBIGUITY: FINDING HIS PLACE IN NEITHER LIFE NOR IDEA, HE SUPPOSES HIMSELF PREDESTINED TO THE ARBITRARY; YET HIS INTOXICATION OF FREEDOM IS ONLY A SHUDDER WITHIN A FATALITY, THE FORM OF HIS FATE BEING NO LESS REGULATED THAN THAT OF A SONNET OR A STAR.

COSMOGONY OF DESIRE
HAVING LIVED OUT—HAVING VERIFIED ALL THE ARGUMENTS AGAINST LIFE—I HAVE STRIPPED IT OF ITS SAVORS, AND WALLOWING IN ITS LEES, I HAVE EXPERIENCED ITS NAKEDNESS. I HAVE KNOWN POST-SEXUAL METAPHYSICS, THE VOID OF THE FUTILELY PROCREATED UNIVERSE, AND THAT DISSIPATION OF SWEAT WHICH PLUNGES YOU INTO AN AGE-OLD CHILL, ANTERIOR TO THE RAGES OF MATTER. AND I HAVE TRIED TO BE FAITHFUL TO MY KNOWLEDGE, TO FORCE MY INSTINCTS TO YIELD, AND REALIZED THAT IT IS NO USE WIELDING THE WEAPONS OF NOTHINGNESS IF YOU CANNOT TURN THEM AGAINST YOURSELF. FOR THE OUTBURST OF DESIRES, AMID OUR KNOWLEDGE WHICH CONTRADICTS THEM, CREATES A DREADFUL CONFLICT BETWEEN OUR MIND OPPOSING THE CREATION AND THE IRRATIONAL SUBSTRATUM WHICH BINDS US TO IT STILL.

EACH DESIRE HUMILIATES THE SUM OF OUR TRUTHS AND FORCES US TO RECONSIDER OUR NEGATIONS. WE ENDURE A PRACTICAL DEFEAT; YET OUR PRINCIPLES REMAIN UNSHAKABLE. . , . WE HOPED TO BE NO LONGER CHILDREN OF THIS WORLD, AND HERE WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE APPETITES LIKE EQUIVOCAL ASCETICS, MASTERS OF TIME AND GRAFTED TO OUR GLANDS. BUT THIS INTERPLAY IS LIMITLESS: EACH OF OUR DESIRES RECREATES THE WORLD AND EACH OF OUR THOUGHTS ANNIHILATES IT. . . . IN EVERYDAY LIFE, COSMOGONY ALTERNATES WITH APOCALYPSE: QUOTIDIAN CREATORS AND WRECKERS, WE ENACT ON AN INFINITESIMAL SCALE THE ETERNAL MYTHS, AND EACH OF OUR MOMENTS REPRODUCES AND PREFIGURES THE FATE OF SEED AND CINDER PERTAINING TO INFINITY.

INTERPRETATION OF ACTIONS
NO ONE WOULD PERFORM THE MEREST ACTION WITHOUT THE FEELING THAT THIS ACTION IS THE ONE AND ONLY REALITY. SUCH BLINDNESS IS THE ABSOLUTE BASIS, THE INDISPUTABLE PRINCIPLE, OF ALL THAT EXISTS. THE MAN WHO ARGUES MERELY PROVES THAT HE IS LESS, THAT DOUBT HAS SAPPED HIS VITALITY. . . . BUT AMID HIS VERY DOUBTS, HE MUST FEEL THE IMPORTANCE OF HIS PROGRESS TOWARD NEGATION. TO KNOW THAT NOTHING IS WORTH THE TROUBLE BECOMES IMPLICITLY A BELIEF, HENCE A POSSIBILITY OF ACTION; THIS IS BECAUSE EVEN A TRIFLE OF EXISTENCE PRESUPPOSES AN UNAVOWED FAITH; A SIMPLE STEP—EVEN TOWARD A MOCK-UP OF REALITY—IS AN APOSTASY WITH REGARD TO NOTHINGNESS; BREATHING ITSELF PROCEEDS FROM AN IMPLICIT FANATICISM, LIKE ANY PARTICIPATION IN MOVEMENT. . . .

LIFE WITHOUT OBJECTIVE
NEUTRAL IDEAS LIKE DRY EYES; DULL LOOKS WHICH STRIP THINGS OF ALL DIMENSION; SELF-AUSCULTATIONS WHICH REDUCE THE FEELINGS TO PHENOMENA OF ATTENTION; A VAPOROUS LIFE, WITHOUT TEARS AND WITHOUT LAUGHTER—HOW TO INCULCATE A SAP, A VERNAL VULGARITY? AND HOW TO ENDURE THIS RESIGNING HEART, THIS TIME TOO BLUNTED TO TRANSMIT EVEN TO ITS OWN SEASONS THE FERMENT OF GROWTH AND DISSOLUTION?

WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN A CORRUPTION IN EVERY CONVICTION AND IN EVERY ATTACHMENT A PROFANATION, YOU NO LONGER HAVE THE RIGHT TO EXPECT, ON EARTH OR ELSEWHERE, A FATE MODIFIED BY HOPE. YOU MUST CHOOSE SOME IDEAL, ABSURDLY SOLITARY PROMONTORY, OR A FARCICAL STAR REFRACTORY TO ALL CONSTELLATIONS. IRRESPONSIBLE OUT OF MELANCHOLY, YOUR LIFE HAS FLOUTED ITS MOMENTS; NOW, LIFE IS THE PIETY OF DURATION, THE FEELING OF A DANCING ETERNITY, TIME TRANSCENDING ITSELF, AND VIES WITH THE SUN. . . .

ACEDIA
THIS STAGNATION OF THE ORGANS, THIS STUPOR OF THE FACULTIES, THIS PETRIFIED SMILE—DO THEY NOT OFTEN REMIND YOU OF THE ENNUI OF THE CLOISTERS, HEARTS ABANDONED BY GOD, THE DRYNESS AND IDIOCY OF THE MONKS LOATHING THEMSELVES IN THE ECSTATIC TRANSPORTS OF MASTURBATION? YOU ARE MERELY A MONK WITHOUT DIVINE HYPOTHESES AND WITHOUT THE PRIDE OF SOLITARY VICE.

EARTH, HEAVEN ARE THE WALLS OF YOUR CELL, AND IN THE AIR NO BREATH DISTURBS, ONLY THE ABSENCE OF ORISONS PREVAILS. DOOMED TO THE EMPTY HOURS OF ETERNITY, TO THE PERIPHERY OF SHUDDERS AND THE MILDEWED DESIRES THAT ROT AT THE APPROACH OF SALVATION, YOU BESTIR YOURSELF TOWARD A LAST JUDGMENT WITHOUT SPLENDOR AND TRUMPETS, WHILE YOUR THOUGHTS, FOR SOLEMNITY, HAVE IMAGINED NO MORE THAN THE UNREAL PROCESSION OF HOPES.

BY GRACE OF SUFFERING, SOULS ONCE FLUNG THEMSELVES TOWARD THE VAULTING ARCHES; YOU STUMBLE AGAINST THEM NOW, AND YOU FALL BACK INTO THE WORLD AS INTO A FAITHLESS CONVENT, LAGGING ON THE BOULEVARD, ORDER OF LOST CREATURES—AND OF YOUR PERDITION.

CRIMES OF COURAGE AND FEAR
TO BE AFRAID IS TO THINK OF YOURSELF CONTINUALLY, TO BE UNABLE TO IMAGINE AN OBJECTIVE COURSE OF EVENTS. THE SENSATION OF THE TERRIBLE, THE SENSATION THAT IT IS ALL HAPPENING AGAINST YOU, SUPPOSES A WORLD CONCEIVED WITHOUT INDIFFERENT DANGERS. THE FRIGHTENED MAN—VICTIM OF AN EXAGGERATED SUBJECTIVITY—BELIEVES, HIMSELF TO BE, MUCH MORE THAN THE REST OF HIS KIND, THE TARGET OF HOSTILE EVENTS. HE ENCOUNTERS THE BRAVE MAN IN THIS ERROR, FOR THE BRAVE MAN, AT THE ANTIPODES, SEES ONLY INVULNERABILITY EVERYWHERE. BOTH HAVE ATTAINED THE EXTREMITY OF A SELF-INFATUATED CONSCIOUSNESS: EVERYTHING CONSPIRES AGAINST THE ONE; TO THE OTHER, EVERYTHING IS FAVORABLE. (THE BRAVE MAN IS ONLY A BRAGGART WHO EMBRACES THE DANGER, WHO FLEES TOWARD THE DANGER.) ONE ESTABLISHES HIMSELF NEGATIVELY AT THE CENTER OF THE WORLD, THE OTHER POSITIVELY; BUT THEIR ILLUSION IS THE SAME, THEIR KNOWLEDGE HAVING AN IDENTICAL POINT OF DEPARTURE: DANGER AS THE ONLY REALITY. ONE FEARS IT, THE OTHER SEEKS IT OUT: THEY CANNOT CONCEIVE A LUCID SCORN OF THINGS, THEY BOTH RELATE EVERYTHING TO THEMSELVES, THEY ARE OVER-AGITATED (AND ALL THE EVIL IN THE WORLD COMES FROM THE EXCESS OF AGITATION, FROM THE DYNAMIC FICTIONS OF BRAVERY AND COWARDICE). THUS THESE ANTINOMIC AND EQUAL EXAMPLES ARE THE AGENTS OF ALL OUR TROUBLES, THE DISTURBERS OF THE MARCH OF TIME; THEY GIVE AN AFFECTIVE TINGE TO THE LEAST EVENT AND PROJECT THEIR FEVERED INTENTIONS UPON A UNIVERSE WHICH-—WITHOUT AN ABANDONMENT TO CALM DISGUSTS—IS DEGRADING AND INTOLERABLE. COURAGE AND FEAR, TWO POLES OF THE SAME DISEASE, WHICH CONSISTS IN GRANTING AN ABUSIVE SENSE AND SERIOUSNESS TO LIFE . . . IT IS THE LACK OF NONCHALANT BITTERNESS WHICH MAKES MEN INTO SECTARIAN BEASTS; THE SUBTLEST AND THE CRUDEST CRIMES ARE PERPETRATED BY THOSE WHO TAKE THINGS SERIOUSLY. ONLY THE DILETTANTE HAS NO TASTE FOR BLOOD, HE ALONE IS NO SCOUNDREL . . . .

DISINTOXICATION
THE NON-MYSTERIOUS CONCERNS OF HUMAN BEINGS MAY BE DRAWN AS CLEARLY AS THE OUTLINES OF THIS PAGE. . . . WHAT IS TO BE INSCRIBED HERE BUT THE DISGUST OF GENERATIONS LINKED LIKE PROPOSITIONS IN THE STERILE FATALITY OF A SYLLOGISM?

THE HUMAN ADVENTURE WILL CERTAINLY COME TO AN END, WHICH WE MAY CONCEIVE WITHOUT BEING ITS CONTEMPORARY. WHEN WE HAVE CONSUMMATED IN OURSELVES THE DIVORCE WITH HISTORY, IT IS QUITE SUPERFLUOUS TO ATTEND THE FORMALITIES. WE NEED ONLY LOOK AT MAN IN THE FACE TO DETACH OURSELVES FROM HIM AND TO NO LONGER REGRET HIS HOAXES. THOUSANDS OF YEARS OF SUFFERINGS, WHICH WOULD HAVE SOFTENED THE HEARTS OF STONES, MERELY PETRIFIED THIS STEELY MAYFLY, MONSTROUS EXAMPLE OF EVANESCENCE AND HARDENING, DRIVEN BY ONE INSIPID MADNESS, A WILL TO EXIST AT ONCE IMPERCEPTIBLE AND SHAMELESS. WHEN WE REALIZE THAT NO HUMAN MOTIVE IS COMPATIBLE WITH INFINITY AND THAT NO GESTURE IS WORTH THE TROUBLE OF MAKING IT, OUR HEART, BY ITS VERY BEATING, CAN NO LONGER CONCEAL ITS VACUITY. MEN MINGLE IN A UNIFORM FATE AS FUTILE, FOR THE INDIFFERENT EYE, AS THE STARS—OR THE CROSSES OF A MILITARY CEMETERY. OF ALL THE GOALS PROPOSED FOR EXISTENCE, WHICH ONE, SUBJECTED TO ANALYSIS, ESCAPES THE MUSIC-HALL OR THE MORGUE? WHICH FAILS TO REVEAL US AS FUTILE OR SINISTER? AND IS THERE A SINGLE STROKE OF MAGIC, IS THERE ONE CHARM WHICH CAN STILL DECEIVE US?

(WHEN WE ARE FORBIDDEN VISIBLE PRESCRIPTIONS, WE BECOME, LIKE THE DEVIL, METAPHYSICALLY ILLEGAL; WE HAVE LEFT THE ORDER OF THE WORLD: NO LONGER FINDING A PLACE THERE, WE LOOK AT IT WITHOUT RECOGNITION; STUPEFACTION TURNS INTO A REFLEX, WHILE OUR PLAINTIVE ASTONISHMENT, LACKING AN OBJECT, IS FOREVER FASTENED TO THE VOID, WE UNDERGO SENSATIONS WHICH NO LONGER CORRESPOND TO THINGS BECAUSE NOTHING IRRITATES THEM ANY LONGER; THUS WE TRANSCEND EVEN THE DREAM OF THE ANGEL OF MELANCHOLIA, AND WE REGRET THAT DÜRER DID NOT LANGUISH FOR EYES EVEN MORE REMOTE. . . .

WHEN EVERYTHING SEEMS TOO CONCRETE, TOO-EXISTENT, INCLUDING OUR NOBLEST VISION, AND WE SIGH FOR AN INDEFINITE WHICH WOULD PROCEED FROM NEITHER LIFE NOR DEATH, WHEN EVERY CONTACT WITH BEING IS A VIOLATION OF THE SOUL, THE SOUL HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION AND, NO LONGER HAVING ANY ACCOUNTING TO MAKE OR LAWS TO INFRINGE, VIES—BY MELANCHOLY—WITH THE DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE.)

ITINERARY OF HATE
I HATE NO ONE; BUT HATRED BLACKENS MY BLOOD AND SCORCHES THIS SKIN WHICH THE YEARS WERE POWERLESS TO TAN. HOW PREVAIL, UNDER TENDER OR RIGOROUS JUDGMENTS, OVER A HIDEOUS GLOOM AND THE SCREAM OF A MAN FLAYED ALIVE?

    I WANTED TO LOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH, THEIR EXPLOITS AND THEIR FEVERS—AND I HAVE FOUND NOTHING WHICH FAILED TO REMIND ME OF DEATH": FLOWERS, STARS, FACES—SYMBOLS OF WITHERING, POTENTIAL SLABS OF ALL POSSIBLE TOMBS! WHAT IS CREATED IN LIFE, AND ENNOBLES IT, TENDS TOWARD A MACABRE OR MEDIOCRE END THE EFFERVESCENCE OF HEARTS HAS PROVOKED DISASTERS WHICH NO DEMON WOULD HAVE DARED CONCEIVE. LOOK UPON A MIND ENFLAMED AND BE SURE THAT YOU WILL END BY BEING ITS VICTIM. THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN THEIR TRUTH—THE ONLY ONES WHOSE IMPRINT IS RETAINED BY THE MEMORY OF MEN—LEAVE THE EARTH BEHIND THEM STREWN WITH CORPSES. RELIGIONS NUMBER IN THEIR LEDGERS MORE MURDERS THAN THE BLOODIEST TYRANNIES ACCOUNT FOR, AND THOSE WHOM HUMANITY HAS CALLED DIVINE FAR SURPASS THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS MURDERERS IN THEIR THIRST FOR SLAUGHTER.

THE MAN WHO PROPOSES A NEW FAITH IS PERSECUTED, UNTIL IT IS HIS TURN TO BECOME A PERSECUTOR: TRUTHS BEGIN BY A CONFLICT WITH THE POLICE AND END BY CALLING THEM IN; FOR EACH ABSURDITY WE HAVE SUFFERED FOR DEGENERATES INTO A LEGALITY, AS EVERY MARTYRDOM ENDS IN THE PARAGRAPHS OF THE LAW, IN THE INSIPIDITIES OF THE CALENDAR, OR THE NOMENCLATURE OF THE STREETS. IN THIS WORLD, HEAVEN ITSELF BECOMES AUTHORITY; AND WE KNOW AGES WHICH LIVED ONLY BY IT—MIDDLE AGES MORE PRODIGAL IN WARS THAN THE MOST DISSOLUTE EPOCHS, BESTIAL CRUSADES TRICKED OUT AS SUBLIMITIES, BEFORE WHICH THE INVASIONS OF THE HUNS SEEM THE REFRAINS OF DECADENT HORDES.

IMMACULATE EXPLOITS DECLINE INTO PUBLIC ENTERPRISE; CONSECRATION DIMS THE MOST AERIAL HALO. AN ANGEL PROTECTED BY A POLICEMAN—THAT IS HOW TRUTHS DIE, THAT IS HOW ENTHUSIASMS EXPIRE. IT IS ENOUGH THAT A REBELLION BE RIGHT AND CREATE ADHERENTS, A REVELATION BE PROPAGATED AND AN INSTITUTION CONFISCATE IT, FOR THE ONCE-SOLITARY TRANSPORTS—DIVIDED AMONG A FEW NEOPHYTE DREAMERS—TO BE CORRUPTED IN A PROSTITUTED EXISTENCE. SHOW ME ONE THING HERE ON EARTH WHICH HAS BEGUN WELL AND WHICH HAS NOT ENDED BADLY. THE PROUDEST PALPITATIONS ARE ENGULFED IN A SEWER, WHERE THEY CEASE THROBBING, AS THOUGH HAVING REACHED THEIR NATURAL TERM: THIS DOWNFALL CONSTITUTES THE HEART’S DRAMA AND THE NEGATIVE MEANING OF HISTORY. EACH “IDEAL” FED, AT ITS BEGINNING, ON THE BLOOD OF ITS VOTARIES, ERODES AND COLLAPSES WHEN IT IS ADOPTED BY THE MOB. THE FONT TRANSFORMED INTO A SPITTOON: THAT IS THE INELUCTABLE RHYTHM OF “PROGRESS". . .

UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, UPON WHOM ARE WE TO POUR OUT OUR HATRED? NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BEING, AND STILL LESS FOR BEING WHAT HE IS. AFFLICTED WITH EXISTENCE, EACH MAN ENDURES LIKE AN ANIMAL THE CONSEQUENCES WHICH PROCEED FROM IT. THUS, IN A WORLD WHERE EVERYTHING IS DETESTABLE, HATRED BECOMES HUGER THAN THE WORLD AND, HAVING TRANSCENDED ITS OBJECT, CANCELS ITSELF OUT.

(IT IS NOT OUR SUSPECT EXHAUSTIONS OR THE SPECIFIC DISTURBANCES OF OUR ORGANS WHICH REVEAL THE LOW. POINT OF OUR VITALITY; NOR IS IT OUR PERPLEXITIES OR THE VARIATIONS OF THE THERMOMETER; BUT WE NEED MERELY ENDURE THOSE FITS OF HATRED AND PITY WITHOUT MOTIVE, THOSE NON-MEASURABLE FEVERS, TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR EQUILIBRIUM IS THREATENED. TO HATE EVERYTHING AND TO HATE YOURSELF, IN A FRENZY OF CANNIBAL RAGE; TO PITY EVERYONE AND TO PITY YOURSELF—APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY IMPULSES, BUT AT THEIR SOURCE IDENTICAL; FOR WE CAN PITY ONLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO AWAY WITH, WHAT DOES NOT DESERVE TO EXIST. AND IN THESE CONVULSIONS, THE MAN WHO ENDURES THEM AND THE UNIVERSE TO WHICH THEY ARE ADDRESSED ARE DOOMED TO THE SAME DESTRUCTIVE AND PITYING FURY. WHEN, ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU ARE OVERCOME WITH COMPASSION WITHOUT KNOWING FOR WHOM, IT IS BECAUSE A LASSITUDE OF THE ORGANS PRESAGES A DANGEROUS DECLINE; AND WHEN THIS VAGUE AND UNIVERSAL COMPASSION TURNS TOWARD YOURSELF, YOU ARE IN THE CONDITION OF THE LAST AND LEAST OF MEN. IT IS FROM AN ENORMOUS PHYSICAL WEAKNESS THAT THIS NEGATIVE SOLIDARITY EMANATES, A SOLIDARITY WHICH, IN HATE OR PITY, BINDS US TO THINGS. THESE TWO FRENZIES, SIMULTANEOUS OR CONSECUTIVE, ARE NOT SO MUCH UNCERTAIN SYMPTOMS AS CLEAR SIGNS OF A FALLING VITALITY IRRITATED BY ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING—FROM UNDELINEATED EXISTENCE TO THE PRECISION OF OUR OWN PERSON.

YET WE MUST NOT DECEIVE OURSELVES: THESE OUTBREAKS ARE THE CLEAREST AND THE MOST IMMODERATE, BUT SCARCELY THE ONLY ONES; AT DIFFERENT DEGREES, EVERYTHING IS PATHOLOGY, EXCEPT FOR INDIFFERENCE.)

“LA PERDUTA GENTE”
WHAT A PREPOSTEROUS NOTION, TO DRAW CIRCLES IN HELL, TO MAKE THE INTENSITY OF THE FLAMES VARY IN ITS COMPARTMENTS, TO HIERARCHIZE ITS TORMENTS! THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO BE THERE; THE REST—MERE FIORITURAS OR . . . BURNS. IN THE HEAVENLY CITY—GENTLER PREFIGURATION OF THE ONE BELOW, BOTH BEING UNDER THE SAME MANAGEMENT—THE ESSENTIAL THING, TOO, IS NOT TO BE SOMETHING—KING, BOURGEOIS, DAY-LABORER—BUT TO ADHERE TO IT OR TO ESCAPE IT. YOU CAN CHAMPION SOME IDEA OR OTHER, HAVE A PLACE OR CRAWL—FROM THE MOMENT YOUR ACTIONS AND YOUR THOUGHTS SERVE A FORM OF REAL OR IMAGINED CITY YOU ARE ITS IDOLATORS AND ITS CAPTIVES. THE TIMIDEST EMPLOYEE AND THE WILDEST ANARCHIST, IF THEY TAKE A DIFFERENT INTEREST HERE, LIVE AS ITS FUNCTION: THEY ARE BOTH CITIZENS INTERNALLY, THOUGH THE ONE PREFERS HIS SLIPPERS AND THE OTHER HIS BOMB. THE “CIRCLES” OF THE EARTHLY CITY, LIKE THOSE OF THE ONE UNDERGROUND, IMPRISON BEINGS IN A DAMNED COMMUNITY, AND DRAG THEM IN THE SAME PROCESSION OF SUFFERINGS, IN WHICH TO LOOK FOR NUANCES WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME. THE MAN WHO ACQUIESCES IN HUMAN AFFAIRS—IN ANY FORM, REVOLUTIONARY OR CONSERVATIVE—CONSUMES HIMSELF IN A PITIABLE DELECTATION: HE COMMINGLES HIS NOBILITIES AND HIS VULGARITIES IN THE CONFUSION OF BECOMING. . . .

TO THE DISSENTER, WITHIN OR OUTSIDE THE CITY, RELUCTANT TO INTERVENE IN THE COURSE OF GREAT EVENTS OR SMALL, ALL MODALITIES OF LIFE IN COMMON SEEM EQUALLY CONTEMPTIBLE. HISTORY CAN OFFER HIM ONLY THE PALE INTEREST OF RENEWED DISAPPOINTMENTS AND ANTICIPATED ARTIFICES. THE MAN WHO HAS LIVED AMONG MEN AND STILL LIES IN WAIT FOR A SINGLE UNEXPECTED EVENT—SUCH A MAN HAS UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND NEVER WILL. HE IS RIPE FOR THE CITY: EVERYTHING MUST BE GIVEN HIM, EVERY OFFICE AND EVERY HONOR. SO IT IS WITH ALL MEN—WHICH EXPLAINS THE LONGEVITY OF THIS SUBLUNARY HELL.

HISTORY AND LANGUAGE
WHO CAN RESIST THE AUTUMNAL WISDOM OF THE FLACCID AND FAISANDÉ CIVILIZATIONS? THE GREEK’S HORROR, LIKE THE BELATED ROMAN’S, OF FRESHNESS AND THE HYPERBOREAN REFLEXES, EMANATED FROM A REPULSION FOR DAWNS, FOR BARBARISM OVERFLOWING WITH FUTURES, AND FOR THE STUPIDITIES OF HEALTH. THE RESPLENDENT CORRUPTION OF EVERY HISTORIC LATE-SEASON IS DARKENED BY THE PROXIMITY OF THE SCYTHIAN. NO CIVILIZATION CAN DRAW OUT AN INDEFINITE AGONY; TRIBES PROWL ABOUT, SCENTING THE AROMAS OF PERFUMED CORPSES. . . . THUS, THE ENTHUSIAST OF SUNSETS CONTEMPLATES THE FAILURE OF ALL REFINEMENT AND THE INSOLENT ADVANCE OF VITALITY. NOTHING LEFT FOR HIM TO DO BUT COLLECT, FROM THE SUM OF THE FUTURE, A FEW ANECDOTES. .. . A SYSTEM OF EVENTS NO LONGER PROVES ANYTHING: THE GREAT DEEDS HAVE JOINED THE FAIRY TALES AND THE HANDBOOKS. THE GLORIOUS EXPLOITS OF THE PAST, LIKE THE MEN WHO PERFORMED THEM, ARE STILL OF INTEREST ONLY FOR THE FINE WORDS WHICH HAVE CONSECRATED THEM. WOE TO THE CONQUEROR WITHOUT A WORD TO SAY! JESUS HIMSELF, THOUGH AN INDIRECT DICTATOR FOR TWO THOUSAND YEARS, MARKED THE MEMORY OF HIS FAITHFUL AND OF HIS DETRACTORS ONLY BY THE TATTERS OF PARADOXES WHICH STREW A BIOGRAPHY SO ADROITLY SCENIC. HOW INQUIRE ABOUT A MARTYR TODAY IF HE HAS NOT UTTERED REMARKS ADEQUATE TO HIS SUFFERINGS? WE KEEP THE MEMORY OF PAST OR RECENT VICTIMS ONLY IF THEIR LANGUAGE HAS IMMORTALIZED THE BLOOD WHICH HAS SPATTERED THEM. THE EXECUTIONERS THEMSELVES SURVIVE ONLY INSOFAR AS THEY WERE PERFORMERS: NERO WOULD BE LONG SINCE FORGOTTEN WITHOUT HIS OUTBURSTS OF BLOODY CLOWNING.

WHEN, AT THE DYING MAN’S BEDSIDE, HIS NEAREST AND DEAREST BEND OVER HIS STAMMERINGS, IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO DECIPHER IN THEM SOME LAST WISH, BUT RATHER TO GATHER UP A GOOD PHRASE WHICH THEY CAN QUOTE LATER ON, IN ORDER TO HONOR HIS MEMORY. IF THE ROMAN HISTORIANS NEVER FAIL TO DESCRIBE THE AGONY OF THEIR EMPERORS, IT IS IN ORDER TO PLACE WITHIN THEM A SENTENCE OR AN EXCLAMATION WHICH THE LATTER UTTERED OR WERE SUPPOSED TO HAVE UTTERED. THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL DEATHBEDS, EVEN THE MOST ORDINARY. THAT LIFE SIGNIFIES NOTHING, EVERYONE KNOWS OR SUSPECTS; LET IT AT LEAST BE SAVED BY A TURN OF PHRASE! A SENTENCE AT THE CORNERS OF THEIR LIFE—THAT IS ABOUT ALL WE ASK OF THE GREAT—AND OF THE SMALL. IF THEY FAIL THIS REQUIREMENT, THIS OBLIGATION, THEY ARE LOST FOREVER; FOR WE FORGIVE EVERYTHING, DOWN TO CRIMES, ON CONDITION THEY ARE EXQUISITELY GLOSSED—AND GLOSSED OVER. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTION MAN GRANTS HISTORY AS A WHOLE, WHEN NO OTHER CRITERION IS SEEN TO BE OPERATIVE AND VALID, AND WHEN HE HIMSELF, RECAPITULATING THE GENERAL INANITY, FINDS NO OTHER DIGNITY THAN THAT OF A LITTERATEUR OF FAILURE AND AN AESTHETE OF BLOODSHED.

IN THIS WORLD, WHERE SUFFERINGS ARE MERGED AND BLURRED, ONLY THE FORMULA PREVAILS.

PHILOSOPHY AND PROSTITUTION
THE PHILOSOPHER, DISAPPOINTED WITH SYSTEMS AND SUPERSTITIONS BUT STILL PERSEVERING IN THE WAYS OF THE WORLD, SHOULD IMITATE THE SIDEWALK PYRRHONISM EXHIBITED BY THE LEAST DOGMATIC OF CREATURES: THE PROSTITUTE. DETACHED FROM EVERYTHING AND OPEN TO EVERYTHING; ESPOUSING HER CLIENT’S MOOD AND IDEAS; CHANGING TONE AND FACE ON EACH OCCASION; READY TO BE SAD OR GAY, BEING INDIFFERENT; LAVISHING SIGHS OUT OF COMMERCIAL CONCERN; CASTING UPON THE FROLIC OF HER SUPERIMPOSED AND SINCERE NEIGHBOR AN ENLIGHTENED AND ARTIFICIAL GAZE—SHE PROPOSES TO THE MIND A MODEL OF BEHAVIOR WHICH VIES WITH THAT OF THE SAGES. TO BE WITHOUT CONVICTIONS IN REGARD TO MEN AND ONESELF, SUCH IS THE HIGH LESSON OF PROSTITUTION, PERIPATETIC ACADEMY OF LUCIDITY, MARGINAL TO SOCIETY—AS IS PHILOSOPHY. “EVERYTHING I KNOW I LEARNED IN THE SCHOOL OF WHORES!” SHOULD BE DIE EXCLAMATION OF THE THINKER WHO ACCEPTS EVERYTHING AND REJECTS EVERYTHING, WHEN, FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE, HE HAS SPECIALIZED IN THE WEARY SMILE, WHEN MEN ARE TO HIM MERELY CLIENTS, AND DIE WORLD’S SIDEWALKS THE MARKETPLACE WHERE HE SELLS HIS BITTERNESS, AS HIS COMPANIONS SELL THEIR BODIES.

OBSESSION OF THE ESSENTIAL
WHEN EVERY QUESTION SEEMS ACCIDENTAL AND PERIPHERAL, WHEN THE MIND SEEKS EVER GREATER PROBLEMS, IT TURNS OUT THAT IN ITS PROCEDURE IT NO LONGER COMES UP AGAINST ANY OBJECT BUT THE DIFFUSE OBSTACLE OF THE VOID. THEREUPON, THE PHILOSOPHIC ENERGY, EXCLUSIVELY ORIENTED TOWARD THE INACCESSIBLE, IS EXPOSED TO RUIN. SCRUTINIZING THINGS AND THEIR TEMPORAL PRETEXTS, IT IMPOSES SALUTARY EMBARRASSMENTS UPON ITSELF; BUT, IF IT SEEKS AN INCREASINGLY GENERAL PRINCIPLE, IT IS LOST AND ANNIHILATED IN THE VAGUENESS OF THE ESSENTIAL.

ONLY THOSE WHO STOP APROPOS IN PHILOSOPHY FLOURISH, THOSE WHO ACCEPT THE LIMITATION AND THE COMFORT OF A REASONABLE STAGE OF ANXIETY. EVERY PROBLEM, IF WE GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT, LEADS TO BANKRUPTCY AND LEAVES THE INTELLECT EXPOSED: NO MORE QUESTIONS AND NO MORE ANSWERS IN A SPACE WITHOUT HORIZON. THE INTERROGATIONS TURN AGAINST THE MIND WHICH HAS CONCEIVED THEM: IT BECOMES THEIR VICTIM. EVERYTHING IS HOSTILE TO IT: ITS OWN SOLITUDE, ITS OWN AUDACITY, THE OPAQUE ABSOLUTE, THE UNVERIFIABLE GODS, AND THE MANIFEST NOTHINGNESS. WOE TO THE MAN WHO, HAVING ARRIVED AT A CERTAIN MOMENT OF THE ESSENTIAL, HAS NOT DRAWN UP SHORT! HISTORY SHOWS THAT THE THINKERS WHO MOUNTED TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER OF QUESTIONS, WHO SET THEIR FOOT ON THE LAST RUNG, THAT OF THE ABSURD, HAVE BEQUEATHED TO POSTERITY ONLY AN EXAMPLE OF STERILITY, WHEREAS THEIR CONFRERES, STOPPING HALFWAY UP, HAVE FERTILIZED THE MIND’S GROWTH; THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR KIND, THEY HAVE TRANSMITTED SOME WELL-TURNED IDOL, SOME POLISHED SUPERSTITIONS, SOME ERRORS DISGUISED AS PRINCIPLES, AND A SYSTEM OF HOPES. HAD THEY EMBRACED THE DANGERS OF AN EXCESSIVE PROGRESSION, THIS SCORN OF CHARITABLE MISTAKES WOULD HAVE RENDERED THEM DISASTROUS TO OTHERS AND TO THEMSELVES; THEY WOULD HAVE INSCRIBED THEIR NAMES ON THE CONFINES OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF THOUGHT—UNHEALTHY SEEKERS AND ARID REPROBATES, AMATEURS OF FRUITLESS DIZZINESS, HUNTERS OF DREAMS IT IS NOT PERMITTED TO DREAM. . . .

IDEAS REFRACTORY TO THE ESSENTIAL ARE THE ONLY ONES TO HAVE A PURCHASE ON MEN. WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITH A REGION OF THOUGHT WHERE EVEN THE MAN WHO ASPIRES TO SETTLE BY NATURAL INCLINATION OR MORBID THIRST IS JEOPARDIZED? NO BREATHING IN A REALM ALIEN TO THE USUAL DOUBTS. AND IF CERTAIN MINDS LOCATE THEMSELVES OUTSIDE THE AGREED UPON INQUIRIES, IT IS BECAUSE AN INSTINCT ROOTED IN THE DEPTHS OF MATTER, OR A VICE RISING OUT OF A COSMIC DISEASE, HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OF THEM AND HAS LED THEM TO AN ORDER OF REFLECTIONS SO EXIGENT AND SO ENORMOUS THAT DEATH ITSELF SEEMS OF NO IMPORTANCE, THE ELEMENTS OF DESTINY MERE NONSENSE, AND THE APPARATUS OF METAPHYSICS NO MORE THAN UTILITARIAN AND SUSPECT. THIS OBSESSION WITH A LAST FRONTIER, THIS PROGRESS IN THE VOID INVOLVE THE MOST DANGEROUS FORM OF STERILITY, BESIDE WHICH NOTHINGNESS ITSELF SEEMS A PROMISE OF FECUNDITY. THE MAN WHO IS DIFFICULT IN WHAT HE DOES—IN HIS TASK OR HIS ADVENTURE HAS MERELY TO TRANSPLANT HIS DEMAND FOR FINISH TO THE UNIVERSAL LEVEL IN ORDER TO BE NO LONGER ABLE TO COMPLETE EITHER HIS WORK OR HIS LIFE.

METAPHYSICAL ANGUISH DERIVES FROM THE CONDITION OF A SUPREMELY SCRUPULOUS ARTISAN WHOSE OBJECT WOULD BE NOTHING LESS THAN BEING. BY DINT OF ANALYSIS, HE ACHIEVES THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPOSING, OF PERFECTING A MINIATURE OF THE UNIVERSE. THE ARTIST ABANDONING HIS POEM, EXASPERATED BY THE INDIGENCE OF WORDS, PREFIGURES THE CONFUSION OF THE MIND DISCONTENTED WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THE EXISTENT. INCAPACITY TO ORGANIZE THE ELEMENTS—AS STRIPPED OF MEANING AND SAVOR AS THE WORDS WHICH EXPRESS THEM—LEADS TO THE REVELATION OF THE VOID. THUS THE RHYMER WITHDRAWS INTO SILENCE OR INTO IMPENETRABLE ARTIFICES. IN THE FACE OF THE UNIVERSE, THE OVER-EXIGENT MIND SUFFERS A DEFEAT LIKE MALLARMÉ’S IN THE FACE OF ART. IT IS PANIC BEFORE AN OBJECT WHICH IS NO LONGER AN OBJECT, WHICH CAN NO LONGER BE MANIPULATED, FOR—IDEALLY—ITS LIMITS HAVE BEEN TRANSCENDED. THOSE WHO DO NOT REMAIN INSIDE THE REALTY THEY CULTIVATE, THOSE WHO TRANSCEND THE TASK OF EXISTING, MUST EITHER COMPROMISE WITH THE INESSENTIAL, REVERSE GEARS AND TAKE THEIR PLACES IN THE ETERNAL FARCE, OR ACCEPT ALL THE CONSEQUENCES OF A SEVERED CONDITION WHICH IS EITHER SUPERFETATION OR TRAGEDY, DEPENDING ON WHETHER IT IS CONTEMPLATED OR ENDURED.

FELICITY OF EPIGONES
IS THERE A PLEASURE MORE SUBTLY AMBIGUOUS THAN TO WATCH THE RUIN OF A MYTH? WHAT DILAPIDATION OF HEARTS IN ORDER TO BEGET IT, WHAT EXCESSES OF INTOLERANCE IN ORDER TO MAKE IT RESPECTED, WHAT TERROR FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT ASSENT TO IT, AND WHAT EXPENSE OF HOPES FOR THOSE WHO WATCH IT . . . EXPIRE! INTELLIGENCE FLOURISHES ONLY IN THE AGES WHEN BELIEFS WITHER, WHEN THEIR ARTICLES AND THEIR PRECEPTS SLACKEN, WHEN THEIR RULES COLLAPSE. EVERY PERIOD’S ENDING IS THE MIND’S PARADISE, FOR THE MIND REGAINS ITS PLAY AND ITS WHIMS ONLY WITHIN AN ORGANISM IN UTTER DISSOLUTION. THE MAN WHO HAS THE MISFORTUNE TO BELONG TO A PERIOD OF CREATION AND FECUNDITY SUFFERS ITS LIMITATIONS AND ITS RUTS; SLAVE OF A UNILATERAL VISION, HE IS ENCLOSED WITHIN A LIMITED HORIZON. THE MOST FERTILE MOMENTS IN HISTORY WERE AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST AIRLESS; THEY PREVAILED EKE A FATALITY, A BLESSING FOR THE NAIVE MIND, MORTAL TO AN AMATEUR OF INTELLECTUAL SPACE. FREEDOM HAS SCOPE ONLY AMONG THE DISABUSED AND STERILE EPIGONES, AMONG THE INTELLECTS OF BELATED EPOCHS, EPOCHS WHOSE STYLE IS COMING APART AND IS NO LONGER INSPIRED EXCEPT BY A CERTAIN IRONIC INDULGENCE.

TO BELONG TO A CHURCH UNCERTAIN OF ITS GOD—AFTER ONCE IMPOSING THAT GOD BY FIRE AND SWORD—SHOULD BE THE IDEAL OF EVERY DETACHED MIND. WHEN A MYTH LANGUISHES AND TURNS DIAPHANOUS, AND THE INSTITUTION WHICH SUSTAINS IT TURNS CLEMENT AND TOLERANT, PROBLEMS ACQUIRE A PLEASANT ELASTICITY. THE WEAK POINT OF A FAITH, THE DIMINISHED DEGREE OF ITS VIGOR SET UP A TENDER VOID IN MEN’S SOULS AND RENDER THEM RECEPTIVE, THOUGH WITHOUT PERMITTING THEM TO BE BLIND, YET, TO THE SUPERSTITIONS WHICH LIE IN WAIT FOR THE FUTURE THEY DARKEN ALREADY. THE MIND IS SOOTHED ONLY BY THOSE AGONIES OF HISTORY WHICH PRECEDE THE INSANITY OF EVERY DAWN. . . .

ULTIMATE AUDACITY
IF IT IS TRUE THAT NERO EXCLAIMED, “LUCKY PRIAM, WHO SAW THE RUIN OF YOUR COUNTRY!” LET US GRANT HIM THE MERIT OF HAVING ACCEDED TO A SUBLIME DEFIANCE, TO THE LAST HYPOSTASIS OF THE BEAU GESTE AND LUGUBRIOUS GRANDILOQUENCE. AFTER SUCH A PHRASE, SO MARVELOUSLY APPROPRIATE IN AN EMPEROR’S MOUTH, ONE IS ENTITLED TO BANALITY; ONE IS EVEN COMPELLED TO IT. WHO COULD PRETEND TO FURTHER EXTRAVAGANCE? THE PETTY ACCIDENTS OF OUR TRIVIALITY FORCE US TO ADMIRE THIS CRUEL AND HISTRIONIC CAESAR (ALL THE MORE IN THAT HIS MADNESS HAS KNOWN A GLORY GREATER THAN THE SIGHS OF HIS VICTIMS, WRITTEN HISTORY BEING AT LEAST AS INHUMAN AS THE EVENTS WHICH PROVOKE IT). BESIDE HIS, ALL ATTITUDES SEEM ANTICS. AND IF IT IS TRUE THAT HE SET ROME ON FIRE IN IMITATION OF THE ILIAD, WAS THERE EVER A MORE TANGIBLE HOMAGE TO A WORK OF ART? IN ANY CASE, IT IS THE ONE EXAMPLE OF LITERARY CRITICISM AT WORK OF AN ACTIVE AESTHETIC JUDGMENT.

THE EFFECT A BOOK HAS UPON US IS REAL ONLY IF WE CRAVE TO IMITATE ITS PLOT, TO KILL IF ITS HERO KILLS, TO BE JEALOUS IF HE IS JEALOUS, TO TAKE SICK AND DIE IF HE SUFFERS AND EXPIRES. BUT ALL THIS, FOR US, REMAINS IN THE POTENTIAL STATE OR DECLINES TO DEAD LETTERS; ONLY NERO GRANTS HIMSELF LITERATURE AS A SPECTACLE; HIS ACCOUNTING IS MADE WITH THE ASHES OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES AND OF HIS CAPITAL . . .

SUCH WORDS AND SUCH ACTIONS HAD TO BE UTTERED AND PERFORMED AT LEAST ONCE. A CRIMINAL TOOK THEM UPON HIMSELF. THIS CAN CONSOLE US, INDEED IT MUST, OR ELSE HOW SHOULD WE RESUME OUR CUSTOMARY BEHAVIOR AND OUR CONVENIENT AND PRUDENT TRUTHS?

EFFIGY OF THE FAILURE
HAVING A HORROR OF ANY ACTION, HE KEEPS TELLING HIMSELF: “MOVEMENT, WHAT FOLLY!” IT IS NOT SO MUCH EVENTS WHICH VEX HIM AS THE NOTION OF PARTICIPATING IN THEM; AND HE BESTIRS HIMSELF ONLY IN ORDER TO TURN AWAY FROM THEM. HIS SNEERS HAVE DEVASTATED LIFE BEFORE HE HAS EXHAUSTED ITS JUICE. HE IS A CROSSROADS ECCLESIAST WHO FINDS IN THE UNIVERSAL MEANINGLESSNESS AN EXCUSE FOR HIS DEFEATS. EAGER TO FIND EVERYTHING UNIMPORTANT, HE SUCCEEDS EASILY, THE EVIDENCE PREPONDERANT ON HIS SIDE. IN THE BATTLE OF ARGUMENTS, HE IS ALWAYS THE WIENER, AS HE IS ALWAYS THE LOSER IN ACTION: HE IS “RIGHT,” HE REJECTS EVERYTHING—AND EVERYTHING REJECTS HIM. HE HAS PREMATURELY COMPROMISED WHAT MUST NOT BE COMPROMISED IN ORDER TO LIVE—AND SINCE HIS TALENT WAS OVER-ENLIGHTENED AS TO HIS OWN FUNCTIONS, HE HAS SQUANDERED IT LEST IT DRIBBLE AWAY INTO THE INANITY OF A WORK. BEARING THE IMAGE OF WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AS A STIGMA AND A HALO, HE BLUSHES AND FLATTERS HIMSELF ON THE EXCELLENCE OF HIS STERILITY, FOREVER ALIEN TO NAIVE SEDUCTIONS, THE ONE FREE MAN AMONG THE HELOTS OF TIME. HE EXTRACTS HIS LIBERTY FROM THE ENORMITY OF HIS LACK OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS; HE IS AN INFINITE AND PITIABLE GOD WHOM NO CREATION LIMITS, NO CREATURE WORSHIPS, AND WHOM NO ONE SPARES. THE SCORN HE HAS POURED OUT ON OTHERS IS RETURNED BY THEM. HE EXPIATES ONLY THE ACTIONS HE HAS NOT PERFORMED, THOUGH THEIR NUMBER EXCEEDS THE CALCULATIONS OF HIS WOUNDED PRIDE. BUT AT THE END, AS A KIND OF CONSOLATION, AND AT THE CLOSE OF A LIFE WITHOUT HONORS, HE WEARS HIS USELESSNESS LIKE A CROWN.

("WHAT’S THE USE?"—THE FAILURE’S ADAGE, THE MAXIM OF DEATH’S TIMESERVER. . . . WHAT A STIMULANT WHEN YOU BEGIN TO SUFFER ITS OBSESSION! FOR DEATH, BEFORE WEIGHING TOO HEAVILY UPON US, ENRICHES US, OUR POWERS GROW AT ITS CONTACT; THEN, IT PERFORMS ITS WORK OF DESTRUCTION UPON US. THE EVIDENCE OF THE USELESSNESS OF ALL EFFORT, AND THAT SENSATION OF A FUTURE CORPSE ALREADY RISING INTO THE PRESENT AND FILLING TIME’S HORIZON, END BY BENUMBING OUR IDEAS, OUR HOPES, AND OUR MUSCLES, SO THAT THE EXCESS OF ENERGY PROVOKED BY THE QUITE RECENT OBSESSION IS CONVERTED—WHEN THAT OBSESSION IS IRREVOCABLY IMPLANTED IN THE MIND—INTO A STAGNATION OF OUR VITALITY. THUS THIS OBSESSION INCITES US TO BECOME EVERYTHING AND NOTHING. NORMALLY IT SHOULD CONFRONT US WITH THE ONE CHOICE POSSIBLE: THE CONVENT OR THE CABARET. BUT WHEN WE CAN EVADE IT BY NEITHER ETERNITY NOR PLEASURES, WHEN, ATTACKED IN THE MIDST OF LIFE, WE ARE AS FAR FROM HEAVEN AS FROM VULGARITY, IT TRANSFORMS US INTO THAT KIND OF DECOMPOSED HERO WHO PROMISES EVERYTHING AND ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING: IDLE MEN WASTING THEIR BREATH IN THE VOID; VERTICAL CARRION WHOSE SOLE ACTIVITY IS REDUCED TO THINKING THAT THEY WILL CEASE TO BE. . . .)

CONDITIONS OF TRAGEDY
IF JESUS HAD ENDED HIS CAREER UPON THE CROSS, IF HE HAD NOT BEEN COMMITTED TO RESUSCITATION—-WHAT A SPLENDID TRAGIC HERO! HIS DIVINE ASPECT HAS COST LITERATURE AN ADMIRABLE SUBJECT. THEREBY HE SHARES THE FATE, AESTHETICALLY MEDIOCRE, OF ALL JUST MEN. LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH PERPETUATES ITSELF IN MEN’S HEARTS, LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH IS EXPOSED TO WORSHIP AND DOES NOT IRREMEDIABLY DIE, HE DOES NOT LEND HIMSELF TO THAT VISION OF A TOTAL END WHICH MARKS OUT A TRAGIC DESTINY. FOR THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY THAT JESUS HAVE NO FOLLOWERS AND THAT THE TRANSFIGURATION DID NOT COME TO RAISE HIM TO AN ILLICIT HALO. NOTHING MORE ALIEN TO TRAGEDY THAN THE NOTION OF REDEMPTION, OF SALVATION AND IMMORTALITY! THE HERO SUCCUMBS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF HIS OWN ACTIONS, WITHOUT ITS BEING GRANTED HIM TO EVADE HIS DEATH BY SOME SUPERNATURAL GRACE; HE CONTINUES—AS AN EXISTENCE—IN NO WAY WHATEVER, HE REMAINS DISTINCT IN MEN’S MEMORY AS A SPECTACLE OF SUFFERING; HAVING NO DISCIPLES, HIS STERILE DESTINY PROVES FRUITFUL TO NOTHING BUT OTHER PEOPLE’S IMAGINATION. MACBETH COLLAPSES WITHOUT THE HOPE OF A REDEMPTION: THERE IS NO EXTREME UNCTION IN TRAGEDY. . . .

THE NATURE OF A FAITH, EVEN IF IT MUST FAIL, IS TO ELUDE THE IRREPARABLE. (WHAT COULD SHAKESPEARE HAVE DONE WITH A MARTYR?) THE TRUE HERO FIGHTS AND DIES IN THE NAME OF HIS DESTINY, AND NOT IN THE NAME OF A BELIEF. HIS EXISTENCE ELIMINATES ANY NOTION OF AN ESCAPE; THE PATHS WHICH DO NOT LEAD HIM TO DEATH ARE DEAD ENDS TO HIM; HE WORKS AT HIS “BIOGRAPHY"; HE TENDS TO HIS DENOUEMENT AND INSTINCTIVELY MANAGES EVERYTHING TO BRING ABOUT EVENTS FATAL TO HIMSELF FATALITY BEING HIS VITAL JUICE, EVERY WAY OUT CAN BE NO MORE THAN A DISLOYALTY TO HIS DESTRUCTION. THUS THE MAN OF DESTINY IS NEVER CONVERTED TO ANY BELIEF WHATEVER: HE WOULD THEREBY SPOIL HIS END. AND, IF HE WERE IMMOBILIZED ON THE CROSS, IT IS NOT HE WHO WOULD RAISE HIS EYES TO HEAVEN: HIS OWN HISTORY IS HIS SOLE ABSOLUTE, AS HIS WILL TO TRAGEDY IS HIS SOLE DESIRE. . . .

THE IMMANENT LIE
TO LIVE SIGNIFIES TO BELIEVE AND TO HOPE—TO LIE AND TO LIE TO ONESELF. THIS IS WHY THE MOST TRUTHFUL IMAGE EVER CREATED OF MAN REMAINS THAT OF THE KNIGHT OF THE DOLEFUL COUNTENANCE, THAT DON WHOM WE FIND IN EVEN THE MOST FULFILLED OF THE SAGES. THE PAINFUL EPISODE AROUND THE CROSS AND THE OTHER MORE MAJESTIC ONE CROWNED BY NIRVANA PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME UNREALITY, THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN GRANTED A SYMBOLIC QUALITY DENIED BY THE SEQUEL OF THE POOR HIDALGO’S ADVENTURES. NOT ALL MEN CAN SUCCEED: THE FECUNDITY OF THEIR LIES VARIES. . . . ONE DECEPTION TRIUMPHS: THERE RESULTS A RELIGION, A DOCTRINE, OR A MYTH—AND A HOST OF ADEPTS; ANOTHER FAILS: THEN IT IS ONLY A DIVAGATION, A THEORY, OR A FICTION. ONLY INERT THINGS ADD NOTHING TO WHAT THEY ARE: A STONE DOES NOT LIE; IT INTERESTS NO ONE—WHEREAS LIFE INDEFATIGABLY INVENTS: LIFE IS THE NOVEL OF MATTER.

A DUST INFATUATED WITH GHOSTS—SUCH IS MAN: HIS ABSOLUTE IMAGE, IDEALLY LIFELIKE, WOULD BE INCARNATED IN A DON QUIXOTE SEEN BY AESCHYLUS. . .

(IF LIFE OCCUPIES THE FIRST PLACE IN THE HIERARCHY OF LIES, LOVE COMES IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARD, LIE WITHIN THE LIE. EXPRESSION OF OUR HYBRID POSITION, LOVE IS SURROUNDED BY AN APPARATUS OF BEATITUDES AND TORMENTS THANKS TO WHICH WE FIND IN SOMEONE A SUBSTITUTE FOR OURSELVES. BY WHAT HOAX DO TWO EYES TURN US AWAY FROM OUR SOLITUDE? IS THERE ANY FAILURE MORE HUMILIATING FOR THE MIND? LOVE LULLS KNOWLEDGE; WAKENED, KNOWLEDGE KILLS LOVE. UNREALITY CANNOT TRIUMPH INDEFINITELY, EVEN DISGUISED IN THE APPEARANCES OF THE MOST EXALTING LIE. AND MOREOVER WHO WOULD HAVE AN ILLUSION SOLID ENOUGH TO FIND IN THE OTHER WHAT HE HAS VAINLY SOUGHT IN HIMSELF? WOULD A FURNACE OF GUTS AFFORD WHAT THE WHOLE UNIVERSE COULD NOT GIVE US? AND YET THIS IS THE ACTUAL BASIS OF THIS COMMON, AND SUPERNATURAL, ANOMALY: TO SOLVE À DEUX RATHER, TO SUSPEND—ALL ENIGMAS; BY MEANS OF AN IMPOSTURE, TO FORGET THAT FICTION IN WHICH LIFE IS STEEPED; BY A DOUBLE MURMUR TO FILL THE GENERAL VACUITY; AND—PARODY OF ECSTASY—TO DROWN ONESELF AT LAST IN THE SWEAT OF SOME ACCOMPLICE OR OTHER. . . .)

THE COMING OF CONSCIOUSNESS
HOW MUCH OUR INSTINCTS MUST HAVE HAD TO BE BLUNTED AND THEIR FUNCTIONING SLACKENED BEFORE CONSCIOUSNESS EXTENDED ITS CONTROL OVER THE SUM OF OUR ACTIONS AND OUR THOUGHTS! THE FIRST NATURAL REACTION SUPPRESSED INVOLVED ALL THE POSTPONEMENTS OF VITAL ACTIVITY, ALL OUR FAILURES IN THE IMMEDIATE. MAN—AN ANIMAL WITH RETARDED DESIRES—IS A LUCID NOTHINGNESS ENCIRCLING EVERYTHING AND ENCIRCLED BY NOTHING, WHO SURVEYS ALL OBJECTS AND POSSESSES NONE.

COMPARED TO THE COMING OF CONSCIOUSNESS, OTHER EVENTS ARE OF A MINOR IMPORTANCE OR NONE AT ALL. BUT THIS ADVENT, IN CONTRADICTION WITH THE DATA OF LIFE, CONSTITUTES A DANGEROUS EXPLOSION AT THE HEART OF THE ANIMATE WORLD, A SCANDAL IN BIOLOGY. NOTHING SUGGESTED ITS IMMINENCE: NATURAL AUTOMATISM SUGGESTED NO LIKELIHOOD OF AN ANIMAL FLINGING ITSELF BEYOND MATTER. THE GORILLA LOSING ITS FOR AND REPLACING IT BY IDEALS, THE GORILLA IN GLOVES, FORGING GODS, AGGRAVATING HIS GRIMACES, AND ADORING THE HEAVENS—HOW MUCH NATURE WAS TO SUFFER, AND WILL SUFFER STILL, BEFORE SUCH A FALL! THIS IS BECAUSE CONSCIOUSNESS LEADS FAR AND PERMITS EVERYTHING. FOR THE ANIMAL, LIFE IS AN ABSOLUTE; FOR MAN, IT IS AN ABSOLUTE AND A PRETEXT. IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE UNIVERSE, THERE IS NO PHENOMENON MORE IMPORTANT THAN THIS POSSIBILITY, RESERVED FOR US, OF CONVERTING EVERY OBJECT INTO A PRETEXT, TO PLAY WITH OUR EVERYDAY UNDERTAKINGS AND OUR LAST ENDS, TO PUT ON THE SAME LEVEL, BY THE DIVINITY OF WHIM, A GOD AND A BROOMSTICK.

AND MAN WILL BE RID OF HIS ANCESTORS—AND OF NATURE—ONLY WHEN HE HAS LIQUIDATED IN HIMSELF EVERY VESTIGE OF THE UNCONDITIONED, WHEN HIS LIFE AND THAT OF OTHERS WILL SEEM NO MORE TO HIM THAN A SET OF STRINGS HE WILL PULL FOR LAUGHS, IN AN AMUSEMENT FOR THE END OF TIME. THEN HE WILL BE THE PURE BEING. CONSCIOUSNESS WILL HAVE PLAYED ITS ROLE. . . .

THE ARROGANCE OF PRAYER
WHEN WE REACH THE LIMITS OF MONOLOGUE, THE CONFINES OF SOLITUDE, WE INVENT—FOR LACK OF ANOTHER INTERLOCUTOR—GOD, SUPREME PRETEXT OF DIALOGUE. SO LONG AS YOU NAME HIM, YOUR MADNESS IS WELL DISGUISED, AND .. . ALL IS PERMITTED. THE TRUE BELIEVER IS SCARCELY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE MADMAN; BUT HIS MADNESS IS LEGAL, ACKNOWLEDGED; HE WOULD END UP IN AN ASYLUM IF HIS ABERRATIONS WERE PURE OF ALL FAITH. BUT GOD COVERS THEM, LEGITIMIZES THEM. THE PRIDE OF A CONQUEROR PALES BESIDE THE OSTENTATION OF A BELIEVER WHO ADDRESSES HIMSELF TO THE CREATOR. HOW CAN ONE DARE SO MUCH? AND HOW COULD MODESTY BE A VIRTUE OF TEMPLES, WHEN A DECREPIT OLD WOMAN WHO IMAGINES INFINITY WITHIN REACH RAISES HERSELF BY PRAYER TO A LEVEL OF AUDACITY TO WHICH NO TYRANT HAS EVER LAID CLAIM?

I SHOULD SACRIFICE THE WORLD’S EMPIRE FOR ONE SINGLE MOMENT WHEN MY CLASPED HANDS WOULD IMPLORE THE GREAT RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR RIDDLES AND OUR BANALITIES. YET THIS MOMENT CONSTITUTES THE COMMON QUALITY—AND IN A SENSE THE OFFICIAL TIME—OF ANY BELIEVER. BUT THE MAN WHO IS TRULY MODEST KEEPS REPEATING TO HIMSELF: “TOO HUMBLE TO PRAY, TOO INERT TO STEP ACROSS THE CHURCH THRESHOLD, I RESIGN MYSELF TO MY SHADOW, AND SEEK NO CAPITULATION FROM GOD BEFORE MY PRAYERS.” AND TO THOSE WHO OFFER HIM IMMORTALITY HE REPLIES: “MY PRIDE IS NOT INEXHAUSTIBLE: ITS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED. YOU IMAGINE, IN THE NAME OF FAITH, THAT YOU ARE CONQUERING YOUR SELF; IN FACT, YOU SEEK TO PERPETUATE IT IN ETERNITY, THIS EARTHLY DURATION BEING INSUFFICIENT FOR YOU. YOUR VAINGLORY EXCEEDS IN REFINEMENT ALL THE AMBITIONS OF THE AGE. WHAT DREAM OF FAME, COMPARED TO YOURS, FAILS TO TURN OUT DECEPTION AND SMOKE? YOUR FAITH IS MERELY A FOLIE DE GRANDEURS TOLERATED BY THE COMMUNITY, BECAUSE IT HAS TAKEN DISGUISED PATHS; BUT YOUR DUST IS YOUR ONE OBSESSION: GREEDY FOR THE TIMELESS, YOU PERSECUTE THE TIME WHICH DISPERSES IT. THE BEYOND ALONE IS SPACIOUS ENOUGH FOR YOUR CRAVINGS; THE EARTH AND ITS MOMENTS SEEM TOO FRAGILE FOR YOU. THE MEGALOMANIA OF MONASTERIES EXCEEDS ALL THAT THE SUMPTUOUS FEVERS OF PALACES EVER IMAGINED. THE MAN WHO DOES NOT ASSENT TO HIS NOTHINGNESS IS MENTALLY DISEASED. AND THE BELIEVER, OF ALL MEN, IS THE LEAST DISPOSED TO ASSENT TO IT. THE WILL TO ENDURE, PUSHED TO SUCH LENGTHS, TERRIFIES ME. I REJECT THE MORBID SEDUCTION OF AN INDEFINITE ME .. . I WANT TO WALLOW IN MY MORTALITY. I WANT TO REMAIN NORMAL.”

(LORD, GIVE ME THE CAPACITY OF NEVER PRAYING, SPARE ME THE INSANITY OF ALL WORSHIP, LET THIS TEMPTATION OF LOVE PASS FROM ME WHICH WOULD DELIVER ME FOREVER UNTO YOU. LET THE VOID SPREAD BETWEEN MY HEART AND HEAVEN! I HAVE NO DESIRE TO PEOPLE MY DESERTS BY YOUR PRESENCE, TO TYRANNIZE MY NIGHTS BY YOUR LIGHT, TO DISSOLVE MY SIBERIAS BENEATH YOUR SUN. LONELIER THAN YOU, I WANT MY HANDS PURE, THE CONTRARY OF YOURS WHICH WERE FOREVER CORRUPTED BY KNEADING THE EARTH AND BUSYING THEMSELVES WITH THE WORLD’S AFFAIRS. I ASK YOUR STUPID OMNIPOTENCE FOR NOTHING BUT THE RESPECT OF MY SOLITUDE AND MY TORMENTS. WHAT HAVE I TO DO WITH YOUR WORDS? AND I FEAR THE MADNESS WHICH WOULD MAKE ME HEAR THEM. GRANT ME THE MIRACLE GATHERED BEFORE THE FIRST MOMENT, THE PEACE WHICH YOU COULD NOT TOLERATE AND WHICH INCITED YOU TO BREACH THE NOTHINGNESS IN ORDER TO MAKE WAY FOR THIS CARNIVAL OF TIME, AND THEREBY TO CONDEMN ME TO THE UNIVERSE—TO HUMILIATION AND THE SHAME OF BEING.)

LYPEMANIA
WHY DO YOU LACK THE STRENGTH TO ESCAPE THE OBLIGATION TO BREATHE? WHY STILL ENDURE THAT SOLIDIFIED AIR WHICH CLOGS YOUR LUNGS AND CRUSHES YOUR FLESH? HOW VANQUISH THESE OPAQUE HOPES AND THESE PETRIFIED IDEAS, WHEN TURN AND TURN ABOUT YOU IMITATE THE SOLIDIFIED OF A CRAG OR THE ISOLATION OF A WAD OF SPITTLE FROZEN ON THE EDGE OF THE WORLD? YOU ARE FARTHER FROM YOURSELF THAN AN UNDISCOVERED PLANET, AND YOUR ORGANS, TURNED TOWARD THE GRAVEYARDS, ENVY THEIR DYNAMISM. . . .

OPEN YOUR VEINS IN ORDER TO FLOOD THIS PAGE WHICH INFURIATES YOU THE WAY THE SEASONS DO? ABSURD EFFORT! YOUR BLOOD, FADED BY WHITE NIGHTS, HAS SUSPENDED ITS FLOW. . . . NOTHING WILL WAKEN IN YOU THE NEED FOR LIVING AND DYING, EXTINGUISHED BY THE YEARS, FOREVER SLAKED BY THOSE SPRINGS WITHOUT MURMUR OR PRESTIGE AT WHICH MEN QUENCH THEIR THIRST. MONSTER WITH MUTE, DRY LIPS, YOU WILL REMAIN BEYOND THE SOUNDS OF LIFE AND DEATH, BEYOND EVEN THE SOUND OF TEARS. . . .

(THE TRUE GREATNESS OF THE SAINTS CONSISTS IN THAT INCOMPARABLE POWER OF DEFEATING THE FEAR OF RIDICULE. WE CANNOT WEEP WITHOUT SHAME; THEY INVOKED THE “GIFT OF TEARS.” A PREOCCUPATION WITH HONOR IN OUR “DRYNESS” IMMOBILIZES US INTO THE SPECTATORS OF OUR BITTER AND REPRESSED INFINITY, OUR STREAMS THAT DO NOT FLOW. YET THE EYES' FUNCTION IS NOT TO SEE BUT TO WEEP; AND REALLY TO SEE WE MUST CLOSE THEM: THAT IS THE CONDITION OF ECSTASY, OF THE ONE REVEALING VISION, WHEREAS PERCEPTION IS EXHAUSTED IN THE HORROR OF THE DÉJÁ VU OF AN IRREPARABLE RECOGNITION SCENE WHICH OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING. . . .

FOR THE MAN WHO HAS FORESEEN THE WORLD’S FUTILE DISASTERS, AND TO WHOM KNOWLEDGE HAS AFFORDED ONLY THE CONFIRMATION OF AN INNATE DISENCHANTMENT, THE SCRUPLES WHICH KEEP HIM FROM WEEPING ACCENTUATE HIS PREDESTINATION TO MELANCHOLY. AND IF HE ACTUALLY ENVIES THE SAINTS” EXPLOITS, IT IS NOT SO MUCH FOR THEIR DISGUST WITH APPEARANCES OR THEIR TRANSCENDENT APPETITE, BUT RATHER FOR THEIR VICTORY OVER THAT FEAR OF RIDICULE, WHICH HE CANNOT AVOID AND WHICH KEEPS HIM ON THIS SIDE OF THE SUPERNATURAL INDECORUM OF TEARS.)

EVERYDAY CURSE
TO REPEAT TO YOURSELF A THOUSAND TIMES A DAY: “NOTHING ON EARTH HAS ANY WORTH,” TO KEEP FINDING YOURSELF AT THE SAME POINT, TO CIRCLE STUPIDLY AS A TOP, ETERNALLY. . . . FOR THERE IS NO PROGRESSION IN THE NOTION OF UNIVERSAL VANITY, NOR CONCLUSION; AND AS FAR AS WE VENTURE IN SUCH RUMINATIONS, OUR KNOWLEDGE MAKES NO GAIN: IT IS IN ITS PRESENT STATE AS RICH AND AS VOID AS AT ITS POINT OF DEPARTURE IT IS A SURCEASE WITHIN THE INCURABLE, A LEPROSY OF THE MIND, A REVELATION BY STUPOR. A SIMPLE-MINDED PERSON, AN IDIOT WHO HAS EXPERIENCED AN ILLUMINATION AND GROWN USED TO IT WITH NO MEANS OF LEAVING IT BEHIND, OF RECOVERING HIS VAGUE AND COMFORTABLE CONDITION-—SUCH IS THE STATE OF THE MAN WHO FINDS HIMSELF COMMITTED IN SPITE OF HIMSELF TO THE PERCEPTION OF UNIVERSAL FUTILITY. ABANDONED BY HIS NIGHTS, VIRTUALLY A VICTIM OF A LUCIDITY WHICH SMOTHERS HIM, WHAT IS HE TO DO WITH THIS DAY WHICH NEVER MANAGES TO END? WHEN WILL THE LIGHT STOP SHEDDING ITS BEAMS, DEADLY TO THE MEMORY OF A NIGHT WORLD ANTERIOR TO ALL THAT WAS? HOW FAR AWAY CHAOS IS, RESTFUL AND CALM, THE CHAOS DATING FROM BEFORE THE TERRIBLE CREATION, OR SWEETER STILL, THE CHAOS OF MENTAL NOTHINGNESS!

DEFENSE OF CORRUPTION
IF WE PUT IN ONE PAN THE EVIL THE “PURE” HAVE POURED OUT UPON THE WORLD, AND IN THE OTHER THE EVIL THAT HAS COME FROM MEN WITHOUT PRINCIPLES AND WITHOUT SCRUPLES, THE SCALE WOULD TIP TOWARD THE FIRST.

IN THE MIND THAT PROPOSES IT, EVERY RECIPE FOR SALVATION ERECTS A GUILLOTINE. . . . THE DISASTERS OF CORRUPT PERIODS HAVE LESS GRAVITY THAN THE SCOURGES CAUSED BY THE ARDENT ONES; MUD IS MORE AGREEABLE THAN BLOOD; AND THERE IS MORE MILDNESS IN VICE THAN IN VIRTUE, MORE HUMANITY IN DEPRAVITY THAN IN AUSTERITY. THE MAN WHO RULES AND BELIEVES IN NOTHING—BEHOLD THE MODEL OF A PARADISE OF FORFEITURE, A SOVEREIGN SOLUTION TO HISTORY. OPPORTUNISTS HAVE SAVED NATIONS; HEROES HAVE RUINED THEM. TO FEEL THAT ONE IS A CONTEMPORARY NOT OF THE REVOLUTION AND OF BONAPARTE, BUT OF FOUCHÉ AND OF TALLEYRAND: THE ONLY THING LACKING IN THE LATTERS’ VERSATILITY WAS A DROP OF MELANCHOLY FOR THEM TO SUGGEST BY THEIR ACTIONS A WHOLE ART OF LIVING.

IT IS THE DISSOLUTE AGES WHICH CAN CLAIM THE MERIT OF LAYING BARE THE ESSENCE OF LIFE OF SHOWING US THAT EVERYTHING IS ONLY-FARCE OR GALL—AND THAT NO EVENT IS WORTH BEING TOUCHED UP: IT IS NECESSARILY EXECRABLE. THE EMBELLISHED LIE OF THE GREAT PERIODS, OF THIS CENTURY, THAT KING, THAT POPE. . . . THE “TRUTH” APPEARS ONLY AT THOSE MOMENTS WHEN MEN’S MINDS, FORGETTING THE CONSTRUCTIVE DELIRIUM, LET THEMSELVES SLIP BACK INTO THE DISSOLUTION OF MORALS, OF IDEALS, AND OF BELIEFS. TO KNOW IS TO SEE; IT IS NEITHER TO HOPE NOR TO TRY.

THE STUPIDITY WHICH CHARACTERIZES HISTORY’S PEAKS HAS NO EQUIVALENT BUT THE INEPTITUDE OF THOSE WHO ARE ITS AGENTS. IT IS OUT OF A LACK OF FINESSE THAT WE CARRY OUR ACTIONS AND OUR THOUGHTS TO THEIR CONCLUSIONS. A DETACHED MIND SHRINKS FROM TRAGEDY AND APOTHEOSIS: DISGRACES AND PALMS EXASPERATE SUCH A SPIRIT AS MUCH AS BANALITY. TO GO TOO FAR IS TO GIVE AN INFALLIBLE PROOF OF BAD TASTE. THE AESTHETE HAS A HORROR OF BLOOD, SUBLIMITY, AND HEROES. . . . HE STILL VALUES ONLY THE DISSIPATED. . . .

THE OBSOLETE UNIVERSE
THE AGING PROCESS IN THE VERBAL UNIVERSE FOLLOWS A MUCH MORE ACCELERATED RHYTHM THAN IN THE MATERIAL ONE. WORDS, TOO OFTEN REPEATED, WEAKEN AND DIE, WHEREAS MONOTONY CONSTITUTES THE VERY LAW OF MATTER. THE MIND SHOULD HAVE AN INFINITE DICTIONARY, BUT ITS MEANS ARE LIMITED TO A FEW EXPRESSIONS TRIVIALIZED BY USAGE. HENCE THE NEW, REQUIRING STRANGE COMBINATIONS, FORCES WORDS INTO UNEXPECTED FUNCTIONS: ORIGINALITY IS REDUCED TO THE TORMENT OF THE ADJECTIVE AND TO THE SUGGESTIVE IMPROPRIETY OF METAPHOR. PUT WORDS IN THEIR PLACE: THAT IS THE EVERYDAY GRAVEYARD OF SPEECH. WHAT IS CONSECRATED IN A LANGUAGE CONSTITUTES ITS DEATH: AN ANTICIPATED WORD IS A DEFUNCT ONE; ONLY ITS ARTIFICIAL USE IMBUES IT WITH A NEW VIGOR, UNTIL IT IS COMMONLY ADOPTED, WORN, CORRUPTED. . . . THE MIND IS PRECIOUS—OR IT IS NOT THE MIND, WHEREAS NATURE LOLLS IN THE SIMPLICITY OF ITS ALWAYS IDENTICAL MEANS.

WHAT WE CALL OUR LIFE, IN RELATION TO “LIFE,” IS AN INCESSANT CREATION OF VOGUES WITH THE HELP OF AN ARTIFICIALLY MANIPULATED SPEECH; IT IS A PROLIFERATION OF FUTILITIES, WITHOUT WHICH WE SHOULD HAVE TO EXPIRE IN A YAWN THAT WOULD ENGULF HISTORY AND MATTER ALIKE. IF MAN INVENTS A NEW PHYSICS, IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO ARRIVE AT A VALID EXPLANATION OF NATURE AS TO ESCAPE THE BOREDOM OF THE UNDERSTOOD, HABITUAL, VULGARLY IRREDUCIBLE UNIVERSE, TO WHICH HE ARBITRARILY ATTRIBUTES AS MANY DIMENSIONS AS WE PROJECT ADJECTIVES UPON AN INERT THING WE ARE TIRED OF SEEING AND SUFFERING AS IT WAS SEEN AND SUFFERED BY DIE STUPIDITY OF OUR ANCESTORS OR OF OUR IMMEDIATE PREDECESSORS. WOE TO THE MAN WHO, HAVING UNDERSTOOD THIS MASQUERADE, WITHDRAWS FROM IT! HE WILL HAVE ENCROACHED UPON THE SECRET OF HIS VITALITY—AND HE WILL JOIN THE MOTIONLESS, UNAFFECTED TRUTH OF THOSE IN WHOM THE WELLSPRINGS OF THE PRECIOUS HAVE DRIED UP, AND WHOSE MIND IS ETIOLATED FOR WANT OF THE ARTIFICIAL.

(IT IS ONLY TOO LEGITIMATE TO IMAGINE THE MOMENT WHEN LIFE WILL NO LONGER BE THE FASHION, WHEN IT WILL FALL INTO DESUETUDE LIKE THE MOON OR TUBERCULOSIS AFTER THE ABUSES OF ROMANTICISM: LIFE WILL THEN CROWN THE ANACHRONISM OF THE DENUDED SYMBOLS AND THE UNMASKED DISEASES; IT WILL ONCE AGAIN BECOME ITSELF: AN ILL WITHOUT PRESTIGE, A FATALITY WITHOUT LUSTER. AND THAT MOMENT IS ONLY TOO FORESEEABLE WHEN NO HOPE WILL REAPPEAR IN MEN’S HEARTS, WHEN THE EARTH WILL BE AS GLACIAL AS ITS CREATURES, WHEN NO DREAM WILL COME BACK TO EMBELLISH THE STERILE IMMENSITY OF IT ALL. HUMANITY WILL BLUSH TO BEGET WHEN IT SEES THINGS AS THEY ARE. LIFE WITHOUT THE SAP OF MISTAKES AND DECEPTIONS, LIFE CEASING TO BE A VOGUE, WILL FIND NO CLEMENCY AT THE MIND’S TRIBUNAL. BUT FINALLY, THAT MIND ITSELF WILL GIVE WAY: IT IS ONLY AN EXCUSE IN THE VOID, AS LIFE IS ONLY A PREJUDICE.

HISTORY SUSTAINS ITSELF AS LONG AS ABOVE OUR TRANSITORY FASHIONS, OF WHICH EVENTS ARE THE SHADOW, A MORE GENERAL FASHION FLOATS LIKE A CONSTANT; BUT WHEN THIS CONSTANT IS GENERALLY EXPOSED AS A SIMPLE WHIM, WHEN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE MISTAKE OF LIVING BECOMES COMMON PROPERTY AND UNANIMOUS TRUTH, WHERE SHALL WE SEEK RESOURCES IN ORDER TO ENGENDER OR EVEN TO SKETCH OUT AN ACTION, THE SIMULACRUM OF A GESTURE? BY WHAT ART SURVIVE OUR LUCID INSTINCTS AND OUR PERSPICACIOUS HEARTS? BY WHAT MIRACLE REANIMATE A FUTURE TEMPTATION IN AN OBSOLETE UNIVERSE?)

DECREPIT MAN
I NO LONGER WANT TO COLLABORATE WITH THE LIGHT OR USE THE JARGON OF LIFE. AND I SHALL NO LONGER SAY “I AM” WITHOUT BLUSHING. THE IMMODESTY OF THE BREATH, THE SCANDAL OF THE LUNGS ARE LINKED TO THE ABUSE OF AN AUXILIARY VERB. . . .

THE TIME IS PAST WHEN MAN THOUGHT OF HIMSELF IN TERMS OF A DAWN; BEHOLD HIM RESTING ON AN ANEMIC MATTER, OPEN TO HIS TRUE DUTY, THE DUTY OF STUDYING HIS LOSS, AND OF RUSHING INTO IT . . . BEHOLD HIM ON THE THRESHOLD OF A NEW EPOCH: THE EPOCH OF SELF-PITY. AND THIS PITY IS HIS SECOND FALL, MORE DISTINCT AND MORE HUMILIATING THAN THE FIRST: IT IS A FALL WITHOUT REDEMPTION. VAINLY HE INSPECTS THE HORIZONS: A THOUSAND SAVIORS ARE SILHOUETTED THERE, HUMBUG SAVIORS, THEMSELVES UNCONSOLED. HE TURNS AWAY IN ORDER TO PREPARE HIMSELF, IN HIS OVERRIPE SOUL, FOR THE SWEETNESS OF CORRUPTION. . . . HAVING REACHED THE INTIMACY OF HIS AUTUMN, HE WAVERS BETWEEN APPEARANCE AND NOTHINGNESS, BETWEEN THE DECEPTIVE FORM OF BEING AND ITS ABSENCE: VIBRATION BETWEEN TWO UNREALITIES. . . .

CONSCIOUSNESS OCCUPIES THE VOID WHICH FOLLOWS THE MIND’S EROSION OF EXISTENCE. IT TAKES THE OBNUBILATION OF AN IDIOT OR A BELIEVER TO PARTICIPATE IN “REALITY,” WHICH COLLAPSES AT THE APPROACH OF THE SLIGHTEST DOUBT, A SUSPICION OF IMPROBABILITY, OR A SHUDDER OF ANGUISH—SO MANY RUDIMENTS WHICH PREFIGURE CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHICH, ONCE DEVELOPED, BEGET IT, DEFINE AND EXASPERATE IT. UNDER THE EFFECT OF THIS CONSCIOUSNESS, OF THIS INCURABLE PRESENCE, MAN GAINS ACCESS TO HIS HIGHEST PRIVILEGE: THAT OF DESTROYING HIMSELF. NATURE’S PRIVILEGED PATIENT, MAN CORRUPTS HER SAP; ABSTRACT VICE OF THE INSTINCTS, HE DESTROYS THEIR VIGOR. THE UNIVERSE WITHERS AT HIS TOUCH AND TIME DECAMPS. . . . HE COULD FULFILL HIMSELF—AND DESCEND THE FURTHER SLOPE—ONLY ON THE WRECK OF THE ELEMENTS. HIS WORK COMPLETED, HE IS RIPE FOR DISAPPEARANCE; THROUGH HOW MANY CENTURIES MORE WILL HIS DEATH RATTLE SOUND?


THE SECOND-HAND THINKER
THE SECOND-HAND THINKER—ADVANTAGES OF DEBILITY—THE PARASITE OF POETS—TRIBULATIONS OF AN ALIEN—ENNUI OF CONQUERORS—MUSIC AND SKEPTICISM—THE AUTOMATON—ON MELANCHOLY—THE THIRST FOR POWER—POSITION OF THE POOR.

IDEAS ARE SUBSTITUTES FOR GRIEFS.

—MARCEL PROUST

THE SECOND-HAND THINKER
I LIVE IN EXPECTATION OF THE IDEA; I FORESEE IT, CLOSE IN UPON IT, GET A GRIP—AND CANNOT FORMULATE IT, IT ESCAPES ME, DOES NOT YET BELONG TO ME: MIGHT I HAVE CONCEIVED IT IN MY ABSENCE? AND HOW, ONCE IMMINENT AND VAGUE, TO MAKE IT PRESENT AND LUMINOUS IN THE INTELLIGIBLE AGONY OF EXPRESSION? WHAT CONDITIONS SHOULD I HOPE FOR IF IT IS TO BLOOM—AND DECAY?

ANTI-PHILOSOPHER, I ABHOR EVERY INDIFFERENT IDEA: I AM NOT ALWAYS DESPONDENT, HENCE I DO NOT ALWAYS THINK. WHEN I CONSIDER IDEAS, THEY SEEM EVEN MORE USELESS THAN THINGS; HENCE I HAVE LOVED ONLY THE ELUCUBRATIONS OF THE GREAT INVALIDS, THE RUMINATIONS OF INSOMNIA, THE FLASHES OF AN INCURABLE FEAR, AND THE DOUBTS INTERSECTED BY SIGHS. THE AMOUNT OF CHIAROSCURO AN IDEA HARBORS IS THE ONLY INDEX OF ITS PROFUNDITY, AS THE DESPAIRING ACCENT OF ITS PLAYFULNESS IS THE INDEX OF ITS FASCINATION. HOW MANY WHITE NIGHTS DOES YOUR NOCTURNAL PAST CONCEAL? THAT IS HOW WE OUGHT TO CONFRONT EVERY THINKER. THE MAN WHO THINKS WHEN HE WANTS TO HAS NOTHING TO TELL US: ABOVE—OR RATHER, ALONGSIDE—HIS THOUGHTS, HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THEM, NOT COMMITTED TO THEM, NEITHER WINS NOR LOSES BY RISKING HIMSELF IN A STRUGGLE IN WHICH HE HIMSELF IS NOT HIS OWN ENEMY. IT COSTS HIM NOTHING TO BELIEVE IN TRUTH. WHICH IS NOT THE CASE FOR A MIND WHERE TRUE AND FALSE HAVE CEASED TO BE SUPERSTITIONS; DESTROYER OF ALL CRITERIA, SUCH A MIND VERIFIES ITSELF LIKE INVALIDS AND POETS; IT THINKS BY ACCIDENT: THE GLORY OF A DISCOMFORT OR OF A DELIRIUM SUFFICES. IS NOT AN INDIGESTION RICHER IN IDEAS THAN A PARADE OF CONCEPTS? MALFUNCTIONS OF OUR ORGANS DETERMINE THE FRUITFULNESS OF OUR MINDS: THE MAN WHO DOES NOT FEEL HIS BODY WILL NEVER BE IN A POSITION TO CONCEIVE A LIVING THOUGHT; HE WILL WAIT TO NO PURPOSE FOR THE ADVANTAGEOUS SURPRISE OF SOME DISADVANTAGE. . . .

IN AFFECTIVE INDIFFERENCE, IDEAS ASSUME A PROFILE; YET NONE CAN TAKE SHAPE: IT IS UP TO MELANCHOLY TO AFFORD A CLIMATE TO THEIR BLOSSOMING. THEY REQUIRE A CERTAIN TONALITY, A CERTAIN COLOR IN ORDER TO VIBRATE, TO SHINE. TO BE STERILE A LONG TIME IS TO LIE IN WAIT FOR THEM, TO YEARN FOR THEM WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO COMPROMISE THEM IN A FORMULA. THE MIND’S “SEASONS” ARE CONDITIONED BY AN ORGANIC RHYTHM; IT IS NOT UP TO “ME” TO BE NAIVE OR CYNICAL: MY TRUTHS ARE THE SOPHISMS OF MY ENTHUSIASM OR OF MY DEJECTION. I EXIST, I FEEL, AND I THINK ACCORDING TO THE MOMENT—AND IN SPITE OF MYSELF. TIME CONSTITUTES ME; IN VAIN I OPPOSE MYSELF—AND / AM. MY UNDESIRED PRESENT UNFOLDS, UNFOLDS ME; UNABLE TO COMMAND IT, I COMMENT UPON IT; SLAVE OF MY THOUGHTS, I PLAY WITH THEM, FATALITY’S BUFFOON. . . .

ADVANTAGES OF DEBILITY
THE INDIVIDUAL WHO FAILS TO TRANSCEND HIS QUALITY AS A SPLENDID EXAMPLE, A FINISHED MODEL, AND WHOSE EXISTENCE IS IDENTIFIED WITH HIS VITAL DESTINY, LOCATES HIMSELF OUTSIDE THE MIND. IDEAL MASCULINITY—OBSTACLE TO THE PERCEPTION OF NUANCE—INVOLVES AN INSENSITIVITY TO THE ASPECT OF THE EVERYDAY SUPERNATURAL, FROM WHICH ART DRAWS ITS SUBSTANCE. THE MORE ONE IS A NATURE, THE LESS ONE IS AN ARTIST. HOMOGENEOUS, UNDIFFERENTIATED, OPAQUE VIGOR WAS IDOLIZED BY THE WORLD OF LEGENDS, BY THE FANTASIES OF MYTHOLOGY. WHEN THE GREEKS TURNED TO SPECULATION, THE CULT OF THE ANEMIC EPHEBE REPLACED THAT OF THE GIANTS; AND THE HEROES THEMSELVES, SUBLIME DOLTS IN HOMER’S TIME, BECAME, THANKS TO TRAGEDY, BEARERS OF TORMENTS AND DOUBTS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THEIR ROUGH NATURE.

INTERNAL WEALTH RESULTS FROM CONFLICTS SUSTAINED WITHIN ONESELF; NOW, THE VITALITY WHICH IS ENTIRELY SELF-POSSESSED KNOWS ONLY EXTERNAL STRUGGLE, THE ATTACK UPON THE OBJECT. IN THE MALE WEAKENED BY A DOSE OF FEMININITY, TWO TENDENCIES ARE AT GRIPS: BY WHAT IS PASSIVE IN HIMSELF HE APPREHENDS A WHOLE WORLD OF RELINQUISHMENT; BY WHAT IS IMPERIOUS, HE CONVERTS HIS WILL INTO LAW. AS LONG AS HIS INSTINCTS REMAIN UNSLAKED, HE CONCERNS ONLY THE SPECIES; ONCE A SECRET DISSATISFACTION CREEPS IN, HE BECOMES A CONQUEROR. THE MIND JUSTIFIES, EXPLAINS, AND EXCUSES HIM, AND CLASSIFYING HIM AMONG THE SUPERIOR SIMPLETONS, ABANDONS HIM TO HISTORY’S CURIOSITY—THE INVESTIGATION OF STUPIDITY IN ACTION. . . .

THE MAN WHOSE EXISTENCE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A DISEASE BOTH VIGOROUS AND VAGUE CAN NEVER ESTABLISH HIMSELF AMONG PROBLEMS NOR KNOW THEIR DANGERS. THE CONDITION FAVORABLE TO THE SEARCH FOR TRUTH OR FOR EXPRESSION IS TO BE FOUND HALFWAY BETWEEN MAN AND WOMAN: THE GAPS IN “VIRILITY” ARE THE SEAT OF THE MIND. . . . IF THE PURE FEMALE, WHOM WE CAN ACCUSE OF NO SEXUAL OR PSYCHIC ANOMALY, IS INTERNALLY EMPTIER THAN AN ANIMAL, THE INTACT MALE FITS THE DEFINITION OF “CRETIN.” CONSIDER ANY HUMAN BEING WHO HAS CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION OR ROUSED YOUR FERVOR: SOMETHING IN HIS MECHANISM HAS BEEN UNHINGED TO HIS ADVANTAGE. WE RIGHTLY SCORN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT MADE USE OF THEIR DEFECTS, WHO HAVE NOT EXPLOITED THEIR DEFICIENCIES, AND HAVE NOT BEEN ENRICHED BY THEIR LOSSES, AS WE DESPISE ANY MAN WHO DOES NOT SUFFER AT BEING A MAN OR SIMPLY AT BEING. HENCE NO GRAVER INSULT CAN BE INFLICTED THAN TO CALL SOMEONE “HAPPY,” NO GREATER FLATTERY THAN TO GRANT HIM A “VEIN OF MELANCHOLY". . . . THIS IS BECAUSE GAIETY IS LINKED TO NO IMPORTANT ACTION AND BECAUSE, EXCEPT FOR THE MAD, NO ONE LAUGHS WHEN HE IS ALONE.

“INNER LIFE” IS THE PREROGATIVE OF THE DELICATE, THOSE TREMULOUS WRETCHES SUBJECT TO AN EPILEPSY WITH NEITHER FROTH NOR FALLING: THE BIOLOGICALLY SOUND BEING SCORNS “DEPTH,” IS INCAPABLE OF IT, SEES IN IT A SUSPECT DIMENSION WHICH JEOPARDIZES THE SPONTANEITY OF HIS ACTIONS. NOR IS HE MISTAKEN: WITH THE RETREAT INTO THE SELF BEGINS THE INDIVIDUAL’S DRAMA—HIS GLORY AND HIS DECLINE; ISOLATED FROM THE ANONYMOUS FLUX, FROM THE UTILITARIAN TRICKLE OF LIFE, HE FREES HIMSELF FROM OBJECTIVE GOALS. A CIVILIZATION IS “AFFECTED” WHEN ITS DELICATE MEMBERS SET THE TONE FOR IT; BUT THANKS TO THEM, IT HAS DEFINITIVELY TRIUMPHED OVER NATURE—AND COLLAPSES. AN EXTREME EXAMPLE OF REFINEMENT UNITES IN HIMSELF THE EXALTÉ AND THE SOPHIST: HE NO LONGER ADHERES TO HIS IMPULSES, CULTIVATES WITHOUT CREDITING THEM; THIS IS THE OMNISCIENT DEBILITY OF TWILIGHT AGES, PREFIGURATION OF MAN’S ECLIPSE. THE DELICATE ALLOW US TO GLIMPSE THE MOMENT WHEN JANITORS WILL BE TORMENTED BY AESTHETES' SCRUPLES; WHEN FARMERS, BENT DOUBLE BY DOUBTS, WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE VIGOR TO GUIDE THE PLOW; WHEN EVERY HUMAN BEING, GNAWED BY LUCIDITY AND DRAINED OF INSTINCTS, WILL BE WIPED OUT WITHOUT THE STRENGTH TO REGRET THE FLOURISHING DARKNESS OF THEIR ILLUSIONS. . . .

THE PARASITE OF POETS
I. THERE CAN BE NO ISSUE IN A POET’S LIFE. IT IS FROM EVERYTHING HE HAS NOT UNDERTAKEN, FROM ALL THE MOMENTS FED ON THE INACCESSIBLE, THAT HIS POWER COMES TO HIM. IF HE FINDS EXISTENCE A DISADVANTAGE, HIS EXPRESSIVE FACULTIES ARE THEREBY REINFORCED, HIS INSPIRATION DILATED.

A BIOGRAPHY IS LEGITIMATE ONLY IF IT FOCUSES THE ELASTICITY OF A FATE, THE SUM OF VARIABLES IT CONTAINS. BUT THE POET FOLLOWS A LINE OF FATALITY WHOSE RIGOR NOTHING INFLECTS. LIFE BELONGS TO DOLTS; AND IT IS IN ORDER TO FILL OUT THE LIFE THEY HAVE NOT HAD THAT WE HAVE INVENTED THE LIVES OF THE POETS. . . .

POETRY EXPRESSES THE ESSENCE OF WHAT CANNOT BE POSSESSED; ITS ULTIMATE MEANING: THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF ALL “ACTUALITY.” JOY IS NOT A POETIC SENTIMENT (THOUGH IT PROCEEDS FROM A SECTOR OF THE LYRIC UNIVERSE IN WHICH CHANCE UNITES, IN ONE AND THE SAME BUNDLE, FLAMES AND FATUITIES). WHO HAS EVER READ A SONG OF HOPE WHICH FAILED TO INSPIRE A SENSATION OF DISCOMFORT, EVEN OF DISGUST? AND HOW SING A PRESENCE, WHEN THE POSSIBLE ITSELF IS SHADOWED WITH VULGARITY? BETWEEN POETRY AND HOPE, COMPLETE INCOMPATIBILITY: HENCE THE POET IS A PREY TO AN ARDENT DECOMPOSITION. WHO WOULD DARE TO WONDER HOW HE HAS EXPERIENCED LIFE WHEN IT IS BY DEATH THAT HE HAS BEEN ALIVE AT ALL? WHEN HE SUCCUMBS TO THE TEMPTATION OF HAPPINESS—HE BELONGS TO COMEDY. . . . BUT IF, ON THE OTHER HAND, FLAMES SPRING UP FROM HIS WOUNDS AND HE SINGS FELICITY—THAT VOLUPTUOUS INCANDESCENCE OF WOE—HE RESCUES HIMSELF FROM THE NUANCE OF VULGARITY INHERENT IN ANY POSITIVE ACCENT. THUS A HÖLDERLIN WITHDRAWING TO A DREAM GREECE AND TRANSFIGURING LOVE BY PURER INTOXICATIONS, BY THOSE OF UNREALITY. . . .

THE POET WOULD BE AN ODIOUS DESERTER OF REALITY IF IN HIS FLIGHT HE FAILED TO TAKE HIS SUFFERING ALONE. UNLIKE THE MYSTIC OR THE SAGE, HE CANNOT ESCAPE HIMSELF, NOR LEAVE THE STAGE OF HIS OWN OBSESSION: EVEN HIS ECSTASIES ARE INCURABLE, AND HARBINGERS OF DISASTERS. UNABLE TO RUN AWAY, FOR HIM EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE, EXCEPT LIFE. . . .

II. THIS IS HOW I RECOGNIZE AN AUTHENTIC POET: BY FREQUENTING HIM, LIVING A LONG TIME IN THE INTIMACY OF HIS WORK, SOMETHING CHANGES IN MYSELF: NOT SO MUCH MY INCLINATIONS OR MY TASTES AS MY VERY BLOOD, AS IF A SUBTLE DISEASE HAD BEEN INJECTED TO ALTER ITS COURSE, ITS DENSITY AND NATURE. VALÉRY AND STEFAN GEORGE LEAVE US WHERE WE PICKED THEM UP, OR ELSE MAKE US MORE DEMANDING ON THE FORMAL LEVEL OF THE MIND: THEY ARE GENIUSES WE HAVE NO NEED OF, THEY ARE MERELY ARTISTS. BUT A SHELLEY, BUT A BAUDELAIRE, BUT A RILKE INTERVENE IN THE DEEPEST PART OF OUR ORGANISM WHICH ANNEXES THEM AS IT WOULD A VICE. IN THEIR VICINITY, A BODY IS FORTIFIED, THEN WEAKENS AND DISINTEGRATES. FOR THE POET IS AN AGENT OF DESTRUCTION, A VIRUS, A DISGUISED DISEASE, AND THE GRAVEST DANGER, THOUGH A WONDERFULLY VAGUE ONE, FOR OUR RED CORPUSCLES. TO LIVE AROUND HIM IS TO FEEL YOUR BLOOD RUN THIN, TO DREAM A PARADISE OF ANEMIA, AND TO HEAR, IN YOUR VEINS, THE RUSTLE OF TEARS. . . .

III. WHEREAS VERSE PERMITS EVERYTHING—YOU CAN POUR INTO IT TEARS, SHAMES, ECSTASIES, COMPLAINTS ABOVE ALL—PROSE FORBIDS YOU TO GIVE VENT, TO LAMENT: ITS CONVENTIONAL ABSTRACTION IS OPPOSED TO OVERFLOWING. PROSE REQUIRES OTHER TRUTHS: VERIFIABLE, DEDUCED, MEASURED. BUT WHAT IF YOU WERE TO STEAL THOSE OF POETRY, IF YOU PILLAGED ITS SUBSTANCE AND DARED AS MUCH AS THE POETS? WHY NOT INSINUATE INTO DISCOURSE THEIR INDECENCIES, THEIR HUMILIATIONS, THEIR GRIMACES, AND THEIR SIGHS? WHY NOT BE DECOMPOSED, ROTTEN, CORPSE, ANGEL, OR SATAN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE VULGAR, AND PATHETICALLY BETRAY SO MANY AERIAL AND SINISTER MOODS? MUCH MORE THAN IN THE SCHOOL OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, IT IS IN THE ACADEMY OF POETS THAT WE LEARN THE COURAGE OF INTELLIGENCE AND THE AUDACITY TO BE OURSELVES. THEIR “AFFIRMATIONS” OUTDO THE MOST STRANGELY IMPERTINENT SAYINGS OF THE ANCIENT SOPHISTS. NO ONE ADOPTS THEM: HAS THERE EVER BEEN A SINGLE THINKER WHO WENT AS FAR AS BAUDELAIRE OR WHO STEELED HIMSELF TO SYSTEMATIZE A LEAR’S HOWL, HAMLET’S SOLILOQUY? NIETZSCHE PERHAPS BEFORE HIS END, BUT UNFORTUNATELY HE KEPT HARPING ON HIS PROPHET’S STRING. . . . AND IF WE LOOKED AMONG THE SAINTS? CERTAIN FRENZIES OF TERESA OF AVILA OR ANGELA OF FOLIGNO. . . . BUT HERE WE MEET GOD TOO FREQUENTLY—GOD, THAT CONSOLING BLANK WHO, REINFORCING THEIR COURAGE, DIMINISHES ITS QUALITY. TO ADVANCE WITHOUT CONVICTIONS AND ALONE AMONG THE TRUTHS IS NOT GIVEN TO A MAN, NOR EVEN TO A SAINT; SOMETIMES, THOUGH, TO A POET. . . .

I CAN IMAGINE A THINKER EXCLAIMING IN AN IMPULSE OF PRIDE: “I’D LIKE A POET TO MAKE HIS FATE OUT OF MY THOUGHTS!” BUT FOR SUCH AN ASPIRATION TO BE LEGITIMATE, HE HIMSELF WOULD HAVE TO HAVE FREQUENTED THE POETS A LONG TIME, HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BORROWED FROM THEM THE JOYS OF MALEDICTION, AND GIVEN BACK, ABSTRACT AND COMPLETED, THE IMAGE OF THEIR OWN DEFECTIONS OR THEIR OWN DELIRIUMS; ABOVE ALL HE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SUCCUMBED ON THE THRESHOLD OF SONG AND, A LIVING ANTHEM THIS SIDE OF INSPIRATION, TO HAVE KNOWN THE REGRET OF NOT BEING A POET, OF NOT BEING INITIATED INTO THE “SCIENCE OF TEARS,” THE SCOURGES OF THE HEART, THE FORMAL ORGIES, THE IMMORTALITIES OF THE MOMENT. . . .

MANY TIMES I HAVE DREAMED OF A MELANCHOLY AND ERUDITE MONSTER, VERSED IN ALL IDIOMS, FAMILIAR WITH NUMBERS AND SOULS ALIKE, WHO WOULD WANDER THE WORLD FEEDING ON POISONS, FERVORS, ECSTASIES, CROSSING PERSIAS, CHINAS, DEFUNCT INDIES, AND DYING EUROPES—MANY TIMES I HAVE DREAMED OF A FRIEND OF THE POETS WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN THEM ALL OUT OF HIS DESPAIR AT NOT BEING ONE OF THEM.

TRIBULATIONS OF AN ALIEN
OFFSPRING OF SOME WRETCHED TRIBE, HE PROWLS THE BOULEVARDS OF THE WEST. CHERISHING ONE COUNTRY AFTER THE NEXT, HE NO LONGER HOPES FOR ANY; STUCK IN A TIMELESS TWILIGHT CITIZEN OF THE WORLD—AND OF NO WORLD—HE IS INEFFECTUAL, NAMELESS, POWERLESS. . . . PEOPLES WITHOUT A DESTINY CANNOT GIVE ONE TO THEIR SONS WHO, THIRSTING FOR OTHER HORIZONS, ATTACH THEMSELVES TO A FATE AND ULTIMATELY EXHAUST IT TO FINISH THEIR DAYS AS GHOSTS OF THEIR ADMIRATIONS AND THEIR EXHAUSTIONS. HAVING NOTHING TO LOVE AT HOME, THEY LOCATE THEIR LOVE ELSEWHERE, IN OTHER LANDS, WHERE THEIR FERVOR ASTONISHES THE NATIVES. OVERWORKED, THE FEELINGS ERODE AND DISINTEGRATE, ADMIRATION FIRST OF ALL. . . . AND THE ALIEN WHO DISPERSED HIMSELF ON SO MANY HIGHWAYS OF THE WORLD, EXCLAIMS: “I HAVE SET UP COUNTLESS IDOLS FOR MYSELF, HAVE RAISED TOO MANY ALTARS EVERYWHERE, AND I HAVE KNELT BEFORE A HOST OF GODS. NOW, WEARY OF WORSHIP, I HAVE SQUANDERED MY SHARE OF DELIRIUM. ONE HAS RESOURCES ONLY FOR THE ABSOLUTES OF ONE’S BREED; A SOUL—LIKE A COUNTRY—FLOURISHES ONLY WITHIN ITS FRONTIERS. I AM PAYING FOR HAVING CROSSED THEM, FOR HAVING MADE THE INDEFINITE INTO A FATHERLAND, AND FOREIGN DIVINITIES INTO A CULT, FOR HAVING PROSTRATED MYSELF BEFORE AGES WHICH EXCLUDED MY ANCESTORS. WHERE I COME FROM I CAN NO LONGER SAY: IN THE TEMPLES I AM WITHOUT BELIEF; IN THE CITIES, WITHOUT ARDOR; AMONG MY KIND, WITHOUT CURIOSITY; ON THE EARTH, WITHOUT CERTITUDES. GIVE ME A SPECIFIC DESIRE AND I COULD SHAKE THE WORLD TO ITS FOUNDATIONS. RELEASE ME FROM THIS SHAME OF ACTIONS WHICH MAKES ME PERFORM, EVERY MORNING, THE FARCE OF RESURRECTION AND, EVERY NIGHT, THAT OF ENTOMBMENT; IN THE INTERVAL, NOTHING BUT THIS TORMENT IN THE SHROUD OF ENNUI. .. . I DREAM OF WANTING—AND ALL I WANT SEEMS TO ME WORTHLESS. LIKE A VANDAL CORRODED BY MELANCHOLY, I PROCEED WITHOUT A GOAL, SELF WITHOUT A SELF, TOWARD SOME UNKNOWN CORNER . . . IN ORDER TO DISCOVER AN ABANDONED GOD, A GOD WHO IS HIS OWN ATHEIST, AND TO FALL ASLEEP IN THE SHADOW OF HIS LAST DOUBTS AND HIS LAST MIRACLES.”

ENNUI OF CONQUERORS
PARIS WEIGHED ON NAPOLEON, BY HIS OWN ADMISSION, LIKE A “LEADEN GARMENT": FOR WHICH TEN MILLION MEN WERE TO DIE. THIS IS THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE MAL DU SIÈDE WHEN A RENÉ ON HORSEBACK BECOMES ITS AGENT. BORN OF THE IDLENESS OF THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY SALONS, THIS DISEASE, IN THE INDOLENCE OF AN OVER-LUCID ARISTOCRACY, EXTENDED ITS RAVAGES DEEP INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE: PEASANTS WERE TO PAY WITH THEIR BLOOD FOR A MODE OF SENSIBILITY ALIEN TO THEIR NATURE AND, WITH THEM, A WHOLE CONTINENT. THE EXCEPTIONAL NATURES IN WHICH ENNUI INSINUATED ITSELF, HORRIFIED BY ANY ONE PLACE AND OBSESSED BY A PERPETUAL ELSEWHERE, EXPLOITED THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE NATIONS ONLY TO MULTIPLY THEIR GRAVEYARDS. THIS CONDOTTIÈRE WHO WEPT OVER WERTHER AND OSSIAN, THIS OBERMANN WHO PROJECTED HIS VOID INTO SPACE AND WHO, ACCORDING TO JOSEPHINE, WAS CAPABLE OF NO MORE THAN A FEW MOMENTS OF ABANDON, HAD AS HIS UNAVOWED MISSION TO DEPOPULATE THE EARTH. THE DREAMING CONQUEROR IS THE GREATEST CALAMITY FOR MEN; THEY ARE NO LESS EAGER TO IDOLIZE HIM, FASCINATED AS THEY ARE BY DISTORTED PROJECTS, RUINOUS IDEALS, UNHEALTHY AMBITIONS. NO REASONABLE BEING WAS EVER THE OBJECT OF WORSHIP, LEFT A NAME, OR MARKED A SINGLE EVENT WITH HIS INDIVIDUAL STAMP. IMPERTURBABLE BEFORE A PRECISE CONCEPTION OR A TRANSPARENT IDOL, THE MOB IS ROUSED BY THE UNVERIFIABLE, BY FALSE MYSTERIES. WHO EVER DIED IN THE NAME OF RIGOR? EACH GENERATION RAISES MONUMENTS TO THE EXECUTIONERS OF THE ONE WHICH PRECEDED IT. IT IS NONETHELESS TRUE THAT THE VICTIMS WERE WILLING ENOUGH TO BE IMMOLATED ONCE THEY BELIEVED IN GLORY, IN THAT VICTORY OF ONE MAN ALONE, THAT DEFEAT OF ALL. . . .

HUMANITY ADORES ONLY THOSE WHO CAUSE IT TO PERISH. REIGNS IN WHICH CITIZENS DIED IN THEIR SLEEP DO NOT FIGURE IN HISTORY, NOR THE WISE PRINCE, INVETERATELY SCORNED BY HIS SUBJECTS; THE CROWD LOVES THE FICTIVE, EVEN AT ITS EXPENSE, THE SCANDAL OF BEHAVIOR CONSTITUTING THE WEB OF HUMAN CURIOSITY AND THE UNDERGROUND CURRENT OF EVERY EVENT. THE UNFAITHFUL WOMAN AND THE CUCKOLD PROVIDE COMEDY AND TRAGEDY, EVEN THE EPIC, THE QUASI-TOTALITY OF THEIR MOTIFS. SINCE VIRTUE HAS NEITHER BIOGRAPHY NOR CHARM, FROM THE ILIAD TO VAUDEVILLE, ONLY THE LUSTER OF DISHONOR HAS ENTERTAINED AND INTRIGUED. HENCE IT IS QUITE NATURAL THAT HUMANITY SHOULD HAVE OFFERED ITSELF UP TO THE CONQUERORS, THAT IT SHOULD SEEK TO BE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT, THAT A NATION WITHOUT TYRANTS SHOULD NEVER BE TALKED ABOUT, THAT THE SUM OF INIQUITIES A PEOPLE COMMITS SHOULD BE THE SOLE INDEX OF ITS PRESENCE AND OF ITS VITALITY. A NATION WHICH NO LONGER RAPES IS IN ITS DECADENCE; THE NUMBER OF RAPES REVEALS ITS INSTINCTS, AND ITS FUTURE. FIND OUT IN WHICH WAR IT HAS STOPPED PRACTICING, ON A LARGE SCALE, THIS VARIETY OF CRIME: YOU WILL HAVE FOUND THE FIRST SYMBOL OF ITS DECLINE; FIND OUT AT WHAT MOMENT LOVE HAS BECOME FOR A NATION A CEREMONIAL, AND THE BED A CONDITION OF ORGASM, AND YOU WILL IDENTIFY THE BEGINNING OF ITS DEFICIENCIES AND THE END OF ITS BARBARIC INHERITANCE.

UNIVERSAL HISTORY: HISTORY OF EVIL. TAKE AWAY THE DISASTERS FROM HUMAN EVOLUTION AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL CONCEIVE OF NATURE WITHOUT SEASONS. IF YOU HAVE NOT CONTRIBUTED TO A CATASTROPHE, YOU WILL VANISH WITHOUT A TRACE. WE INTEREST OTHERS BY THE MISFORTUNE WE SPREAD AROUND US. “I NEVER MADE ANYONE SUFFER!"—AN EXCLAMATION FOREVER ALIEN TO A CREATURE OF FLESH AND BLOOD. WHEN WE FEEL ENTHUSIASM FOR A CHARACTER OF THE PAST, OR THE PRESENT, WE UNCONSCIOUSLY ASK OURSELVES: “FOR HOW MANY PEOPLE WAS HE THE CAUSE OF DISASTER?” WHO KNOWS IF EACH OF US DOESN’T ASPIRE TO THE PRIVILEGE OF KILLING ALL HIS KIND? BUT THIS PRIVILEGE IS ASSIGNED TO VERY FEW, AND NEVER INTEGRALLY: THIS RESTRICTION ALONE EXPLAINS WHY THE EARTH IS STILL INHABITED. INDIRECT MURDERERS, WE CONSTITUTE AN INERT MASS, A MULTITUDE OF OBJECTS CONFRONTING TIME’S TRUE SUBJECTS, THE GREAT CRIMINALS WHO CAME TO SOMETHING.

BUT WE CAN TAKE COMFORT: OUR DESCENDANTS, REMOTE OR IMMEDIATE, WILL AVENGE US. FOR IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO IMAGINE THE MOMENT WHEN MEN WILL CUT EACH OTHER’S THROATS OUT OF DISGUST WITH THEMSELVES, WHEN ENNUI WILL GET THE BEST OF THEIR PREJUDICES AND THEIR DIFFIDENCES, WHEN THEY WILL RUN OUT INTO THE STREET TO SLAKE THEIR THIRST FOR BLOOD, AND WHEN THE DESTRUCTIVE DREAM PROLONGED FOR SO MANY GENERATIONS WILL BECOME THE UNIVERSAL REALITY. . . .

MUSIC AND SKEPTICISM
I HAVE SEARCHED FOR DOUBT IN ALL THE ARTS, HAVE FOUND IT THERE ONLY DISGUISED, FURTIVE, BREAKING OUT DURING THE ENTR'ACTES OF INSPIRATION, RISING FROM SLACKENED IMPULSE; BUT I HAVE GIVEN UP SEARCHING FOR IT—EVEN IN THIS FORM—IN MUSIC; IT CANNOT BLOOM THERE: IGNORANT OF IRONY, MUSIC PROCEEDS NOT FROM THE PRANKS OF THE INTELLECT BUT FROM THE TENDER OR VEHEMENT NUANCES OF NAÏVETE, STUPIDITY OF THE SUBLIME, HEEDLESSNESS OF THE INFINITE. . . . WIT HAVING NO EQUIVALENT IN SOUND, WE DENIGRATE A MUSICIAN BY CALLING HIM INTELLIGENT. THIS ATTRIBUTE DIMINISHES HIM AND IS NOT SUITABLE IN THAT LANGUOROUS COSMOGONY WHERE, LIKE A BLIND GOD, HE IMPROVISES ONE UNIVERSE AFTER ANOTHER. IF HE WERE CONSCIOUS OF HIS GIFT, OF HIS GENIUS, HE WOULD SUCCUMB TO PRIDE; BUT HE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR IT; BORN IN THE ORACLE, HE CANNOT UNDERSTAND HIMSELF. LET THE STERILE INTERPRET HIM: HE IS NOT A CRITIC, AS GOD IS NOT A THEOLOGIAN.

LIMIT-CASE OF UNREALITY AND THE ABSOLUTE, INFINITELY REAL FICTION, A LIE MORE AUTHENTIC THAN THE WORLD, MUSIC LOSES ITS PRESTIGE AS SOON AS, DRY OR MOROSE, WE DISSOCIATE OURSELVES FROM THE CREATION, AND BACH HIMSELF SEEMS NO MORE THAN INSIPID RUMORS; THIS IS THE EXTREME POINT OF OUR NON-PARTICIPATION IN THINGS, OF OUR COLDNESS AND OUR COLLAPSE. TO JEER AMID THE SUBLIME—SARDONIC VICTORY OF THE SUBJECTIVE PRINCIPLE, AND ONE WHICH MAKES US MEMBERS OF THE DEVIL’S BROOD! LOST IS THE MAN WHO HAS NO MORE TEARS FOR MUSIC, WHO EVES NOW ONLY BY THE MEMORY OF THOSE HE HAS SHED: STERILE LUCIDITY WILL HAVE VANQUISHED ECSTASY—WHICH ONCE CREATED WORLDS. . . .

THE AUTOMATON
I BREATHE OUT OF PREJUDICE. AND I CONTEMPLATE THE SPASM OF IDEAS, WHILE THE VOID SMILES AT ITSELF. . . . NO MORE SWEAT IN SPACE, NO MORE LIFE; THE LEAST VULGARITY WILL MAKE IT REAPPEAR: A SECOND’S WAITING WILL SUFFICE.

WHEN WE PERCEIVE OURSELVES EXISTING WE HAVE THE SENSATION OF A STUPEFIED MADMAN WHO SURPRISES HIS OWN LUNACY AND VAINLY SEEKS TO GIVE IT A NAME. HABITUACIÓN BLUNTS OUR AMAZEMENT AT BEING: WE ARE—AND MOVE ON, WE GO BACK TO OUR PLACE IN THE ASYLUM OF THE EXISTING.

A CONFORMIST, I LIVE, I TRY TO LIVE, BY IMITATION, BY RESPECT FOR THE RULES OF THE GAME, BY HORROR OF ORIGINALITY. AN AUTOMATON’S RESIGNATION: TO AFFECT A PRETENSE OF FERVOR AND SECRETLY TO LAUGH AT IT; TO BOW TO CONVENTIONS ONLY TO REPUDIATE THEM ON THE SLY; TO BE NUMBERED IN EVERY LEDGER BUT TO HAVE NO RESIDENCE IN TIME; TO SAVE FACE WHEREAS IT WOULD BE ONLY DUTY TO LOSE IT. . . .

THE MAN WHO SCORNS EVERYTHING MUST ASSUME AN AIR OF PERFECT DIGNITY, DECEIVE THE OTHERS AND EVEN HIMSELF: THEREBY HE WILL THE MORE EASILY ACCOMPLISH HIS TASK OF COUNTERFEIT LIVING. WHAT USE DISPLAYING YOUR FAILURE WHEN YOU CAN FEIGN PROSPERITY? HELL LACKS MANNERS: IT IS THE EXASPERATED IMAGE OF A FRANK AND UNCOUTH MAN, IT IS THE EARTH CONCEIVED WITHOUT ONE SUPERSTITION OF ELEGANCE AND CIVILITY.

I ACCEPT LIFE OUT OF POLITENESS: PERPETUAL REBELLION IS IN BAD TASTE, AS IS THE SUBLIMITY OF SUICIDE. AT TWENTY WE RAGE AGAINST THE HEAVENS AND THE FILTH THEY HIDE; THEN WE GROW TIRED OF IT. THE TRAGIC ATTITUDE SUITS ONLY AN EXTENDED AND RIDICULOUS PUBERTY; BUT IT TAKES A THOUSAND ORDEALS TO ACHIEVE THE HISTRIONICS OF DETACHMENT.

THE MAN WHO, LIBERATED FROM ALL THE PRINCIPLES OF CUSTOM, LACKS ANY GIFT AS AN ACTOR IS THE ARCHETYPE OF WRETCHEDNESS, THE IDEALLY UNHAPPY BEING. NO USE CONSTRUCTING THIS MODEL OF INGENUOUSNESS: LIFE IS TOLERABLE ONLY BY THE DEGREE OF MYSTIFICATION WE ENDOW IT WITH. SUCH A MODEL WOULD BE THE IMMEDIATE RAIN OF SOCIETY, THE “PLEASURE” OF COMMUNAL LIFE RESIDING IN THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF GIVING FREE REIN TO THE INFINITY OF OUR ULTERIOR MOTIVES. IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE ALL IMPOSTORS THAT WE ENDURE EACH OTHER. THE MAN WHO DOES NOT CONSENT TO LIE WILL SEE THE EARTH SHRINK UNDER HIS FEET: WE ARE BIOLOGICALLY OBLIGED TO THE FALSE. NO MORAL HERO WHO IS NOT CHILDISH, INEFFECTUAL, OR INAUTHENTIC; FOR TRUE AUTHENTICITY IS THE FLAW IN FRAUD, IN THE PROPRIETIES OF PUBLIC FLATTERY AND SECRET DEFAMATION. IF OUR FELLOW MEN COULD BE AWARE OF OUR OPINIONS ABOUT THEM, LOVE, FRIENDSHIP, AND DEVOTION WOULD BE FOREVER ERASED FROM THE DICTIONARIES; AND IF WE HAD THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT THE DOUBTS WE TIMIDLY CONCEIVE ABOUT OURSELVES, NONE OF US WOULD UTTER AN “I” WITHOUT SHAME. MASQUERADE RULES ALL THE LIVING, FROM THE TROGLODYTE TO THE SKEPTIC. SINCE ONLY THE RESPECT FOR APPEARANCES SEPARATES US FROM CARRION, IT IS DEATH TO CONSIDER THE BASIS OF THINGS, OF BEINGS; LET US ABIDE BY A MORE AGREEABLE NOTHINGNESS: OUR CONSTITUTION TOLERATES ONLY A CERTAIN DOSAGE OF TRUTH. . . .

LET US KEEP DEEP DOWN INSIDE A CERTITUDE SUPERIOR TO ALL THE OTHERS: LIFE HAS NO MEANING, IT CANNOT HAVE ANY SUCH THING. WE SHOULD KILL OURSELVES ON THE SPOT IF AN UNLOOKED FOR REVELATION PERSUADED US OF THE CONTRARY. THE AIR GONE, WE SHOULD STILL BREATHE; BUT WE SHOULD IMMEDIATELY SMOTHER IF THE JOY OF INANITY WERE TAKEN FROM US. . . .

ON MELANCHOLY
WHEN WE CANNOT BE DELIVERED FROM OURSELVES, WE DELIGHT IN DEVOURING OURSELVES. IN VAIN WE CALL UPON THE LORD OF SHADES, THE BESTOWER OF A PRECISE CURSE: WE ARE INVALIDS WITHOUT DISEASE, AND REPROBATES WITHOUT VICES. MELANCHOLY IS THE DREAM STATE OF EGOISM: NO LONGER ANY OBJECT OUTSIDE ONESELF, NO REASON FOR HATE OR LOVE, BUT THAT SAME FALL INTO A LANGUID MUD, THAT SAME CIRCLING OF THE DAMNED WITHOUT A HELL, THOSE SAME REITERATIONS OF A ZEAL TO PERISH. . . . WHEREAS SADNESS IS CONTENT WITH A CIRCUMSTANTIAL CONTEXT, MELANCHOLY REQUIRES A DEBAUCH OF SPACE, AN INFINITE LANDSCAPE IN ORDER TO SPREAD OUT ITS SULLEN AND VAPOROUS GRACE, ITS SHAPELESS EVIL, WHICH, FEARING TO RECOVER, DREADS ANY LIMIT TO ITS DISSOLUTION AND ITS UNDULATION. IT EXPANDS—STRANGEST FLOWER OF SELF-LOVE—AMONG THE POISONS FROM WHICH IT EXTRACTS ITS VITAL JUICES AND THE VIGOR OF ALL ITS FAILURES. FEEDING ON WHAT CORRUPTS IT, MELANCHOLY HIDES, UNDER ITS MELODIOUS NAME, SELF-COMMISERATION AND THE PRIDE OF DEFEAT. .

THE THIRST FOR POWER
A CAESAR IS CLOSER TO A VILLAGE MAYOR THAN TO A MIND SOVEREIGNLY LUCID BUT LACKING THE INSTINCT OF DOMINATION. THE IMPORTANT FACT IS TO COMMAND: ALMOST ALL MEN ASPIRE TO THIS. WHETHER YOU HAVE IN YOUR HANDS AN EMPIRE, A TRIBE, A FAMILY, OR A SERVANT, YOU DEPLOY YOUR TALENT AS A TYRANT, GLORIOUS OR ABSURD: A WHOLE WORLD OR A SINGLE PERSON OBEYS YOUR ORDERS. THUS IS ESTABLISHED THE SERIES OF CALAMITIES WHICH RISE FROM THE NEED, THE THIRST TO EXCEL . . . WE JOSTLE NONE BUT SATRAPS: EACH OF US—ACCORDING TO HIS MEANS—SEEKS OUT A HOST OF SLAVES OR IS CONTENT WITH JUST ONE. NO ONE IS SELF-SUFFICIENT: THE MOST MODEST OF MEN WILL ALWAYS FIND A FRIEND OR A COMPANION TO AUTHENTICATE HIS DREAM OF AUTHORITY. THE MAN WHO OBEYS WILL BE OBEYED IN HIS TURN: THE VICTIM WILL BECOME THE EXECUTIONER; THIS IS THE SUPREME DESIRE—UNIVERSALLY. ONLY BEGGARS AND SAGES DO NOT EXPERIENCE IT; UNLESS THEIRS IS AN EVEN SUBTLER GAME. . .

THE THIRST FOR POWER PERMITS HISTORY TO RENEW ITSELF AND YET TO REMAIN BASICALLY THE SAME; RELIGIONS TRY TO OPPOSE THIS APPETITE, BUT MANAGE ONLY TO EXASPERATE IT. CHRISTIANITY WOULD HAVE FOUND AN ISSUE WHETHER THE EARTH WAS A DESERT OR A PARADISE. UNDER THE VARIABLE FORMS MAN CAN ASSUME IS CONCEALED ONE CONSTANT, AN IDENTICAL BASIS WHICH EXPLAINS WHY, AGAINST ALL THE APPEARANCES OF CHANGE, WE MOVE IN A CIRCLE—AND WHY, IF WE LOST, FOLLOWING SOME SUPERNATURAL INTERVENTION, OUR QUALITY AS MONSTERS AND CLOWNS, HISTORY WOULD IMMEDIATELY VANISH.

TRY TO BE FREE: YOU WILL DIE OF HUNGER. SOCIETY TOLERATES YOU ONLY IF YOU ARE SUCCESSIVELY SERVILE AND DESPOTIC; IT IS A PRISON WITHOUT GUARDS—BUT FROM WHICH YOU DO NOT ESCAPE WITHOUT DYING. WHERE TO GO, WHEN YOU CAN LIVE ONLY IN THE CITY AND YOU LACK THE INSTINCTS FOR DOING SO, AND WHEN YOU ARE NOT ENTERPRISING ENOUGH TO BEG YOUR BREAD, NOR BALANCED ENOUGH TO GIVE YOURSELF UP TO WISDOM? IN THE END, YOU STAY THERE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, PRETENDING TO BUSY YOURSELF; YOU CONVINCE YOURSELF OF THIS EXTREMITY BY THE RESOURCES OF ARTIFICE, SINCE IT IS LESS ABSURD TO SIMULATE LIFE THAN TO LIVE IT.

AS LONG AS MEN HAVE THE PASSION OF THE CITY, A DISGUISED CANNIBALISM WILL RULE THERE. THE POLITICAL INSTINCT IS THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCE OF SIN, THE IMMEDIATE MATERIALIZATION OF THE FALL. EACH MAN SHOULD BE ASSIGNED TO HIS SOLITUDE, BUT EACH MAN KEEPS AN EYE ON THAT OF EVERYONE ELSE. ANGELS AND BANDITS HAVE THEIR LEADERS; HOW COULD THE INTERMEDIARY CREATURES—THE VERY TEXTURE OF HUMANITY—LACK THEIRS? TAKE AWAY THEIR DESIRE TO BE SLAVES OR TYRANTS AND YOU DEMOLISH THE CITY IN THE WINK OF AN EYE. THE MONKEY-PACT IS SEALED FOREVER; AND HISTORY FOLLOWS ITS COURSE, THE HORDE GASPING BETWEEN CRIMES AND DREAMS. NOTHING CAN ARREST IT: EVEN THOSE WHO EXECRATE IT PARTICIPATE IN ITS PROGRESS. . . .

POSITION OF THE POOR
OWNERS AND BEGGARS: TWO CATEGORIES WHICH OPPOSE ANY CHANGE, ANY RENEWING DISORDER. PLACED AT THE TWO EXTREMITIES OF THE SOCIAL LADDER, THEY FEAR ANY MODIFICATION IN GOOD AND EVIL: THEY ARE EQUALLY SETTLED THE FORMER IN OPULENCE, THE LATTER IN DESTITUTION. BETWEEN DIEM ARE LOCATED—ANONYMOUS SWEAT, THE BASIS OF SOCIETY—THOSE WHO STRIVE, LABOR, PERSEVERE, AND CULTIVATE THE ABSURDITY OF HOPE. THE STATE FEEDS ON THEIR ANEMIA; THE NOTION OF CITIZEN WOULD HAVE NEITHER CONTENT NOR REALITY WITHOUT THEM, ANY MORE THAN LUXURY AND ALMS: THE RICH MAN AND THE BEGGAR ARE PARASITES OF THE POOR, THE PAUPER’S DEPENDENTS.

IF MISERY HAS A THOUSAND REMEDIES, POVERTY HAS NONE. HOW SUCCOR THOSE WHO PERSIST IN NOT DYING OF HUNGER? GOD HIMSELF COULD NOT CORRECT THEIR LOT. BETWEEN FORTUNE’S DARLINGS AND THE TATTERDEMALION CIRCULATE THESE HONORABLE STARVELINGS, EXPLOITED BY SPLENDOR AND BY RAGS, PILLAGED BY THOSE WHO, LOATHING LABOR, SETTLE, ACCORDING TO THEIR LUCK OR THEIR VOCATION, IN THE SALON OR THE GUTTER. AND SO HUMANITY ADVANCES: WITH A FEW RICH MEN, WITH A FEW BEGGARS—AND WITH ALL ITS POOR. . . .

FACES OF DECADENCE
THE WEARINESS OF LONG-FORGOTTEN PEOPLES HANGS HEAVY ON MY EYELIDS.

—HUGO VON HOFMANNSTHAL

A CIVILIZATION BEGINS TO DECLINE THE MOMENT LIFE BECOMES ITS SOLE OBSESSION. EPOCHS OF APOGEE CULTIVATE VALUES FOR THEIR OWN SAKE: LIFE IS ONLY A MEANS OF REALIZING THEM; THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOT AWARE OF LIVING, HE LIVES—HAPPY SLAVE OF THE FORMS HE ENGENDERS, TENDS, AND IDOLIZES. AFFECTIVITY DOMINATES AND FILLS HIM. NO CREATION WITHOUT THE RESOURCES OF “FEELING,” WHICH ARE LIMITED; YET FOR THE MAN WHO EXPERIENCES ONLY THEIR WEALTH, THEY SEEM INEXHAUSTIBLE: THIS ILLUSION PRODUCES HISTORY. IN DECADENCE, AFFECTIVE DRYING-UP PERMITS ONLY TWO MODALITIES OF FEELING AND UNDERSTANDING: SENSATION AND IDEA. NOW, IT IS BY AFFECTIVITY THAT WE PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLD OF VALUES, THAT WE PROJECT A VITALITY INTO CATEGORIES AND NORMS. THE ACTIVITY OF A PRODUCTIVE CIVILIZATION CONSISTS IN DRAWING IDEAS OUT OF THEIR ABSTRACT NOTHINGNESS, IN TRANSFORMING CONCEPTS INTO MYTHS. THE TRANSITION FROM THE ANONYMOUS INDIVIDUAL TO THE CONSCIOUS INDIVIDUAL HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE; YET IT IS INEVITABLE. MEASURE IT: IN GREECE, FROM HOMER TO THE SOPHISTS; IN ROME, FROM THE AUSTERE OLD REPUBLIC TO THE “WISDOMS” OF THE EMPIRE; IN THE MODERN WORLD, FROM THE CATHEDRALS TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY LACE.

A NATION CANNOT CREATE INDEFINITELY. IT IS OILED UPON TO GIVE EXPRESSION AND MEANING TO A SUM OF VALUES WHICH ARE EXHAUSTED WITH THE SOUL WHICH HAS BEGOTTEN THEM. THE CITIZEN WAKENS FROM A PRODUCTIVE HYPNOSIS; THE REIGN OF LUCIDITY BEGINS; THE MASSES WIELD NO MORE THAN EMPTY CATEGORIES. MYTHS TURN BACK INTO CONCEPTS: THAT IS DECADENCE. AND THE CONSEQUENCES MAKE THEMSELVES FELT: THE INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO LIVE, HE CONVERTS LIFE INTO FINALITY, HE ELEVATES HIMSELF TO THE RANK OF A MINOR EXCEPTION. THE LEDGER OF THESE EXCEPTIONS, CONSTITUTING THE DEFICIT OF A CIVILIZATION, PREFIGURES ITS EFFACEMENT.

EVERYONE ACHIEVES DELICACY—BUT IS IT NOT THE RADIANT STUPIDITY OF THE DOLTS WHICH ACCOMPLISHES THE WORK OF THE GREAT PERIODS?

ACCORDING TO MONTESQUIEU, AT THE END OF THE EMPIRE THE ROMAN ARMY CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF CAVALRY. BUT HE NEGLECTS TO SUPPLY US WITH THE REASON FOR THIS. IMAGINE THE LEGIONARY SATURATED WITH GLORY, WEALTH, AND DEBAUCHERY AFTER HAVING TRAVERSED COUNTLESS LANDS AND HAVING LOST HIS FAITH AND HIS FORCE ON CONTACT WITH SO MANY TEMPLES AND VICES—IMAGINE SUCH A MAN ON FOOT! HE HAS CONQUERED THE WORLD AS AN INFANTRYMAN; HE WILL LOSE IT ON HORSEBACK. INDOLENCE INVARIABLY REVEALS A PHYSIOLOGICAL INCAPACITY TO ADHERE ANY LONGER TO THE MYTHS OF THE CITY. THE EMANCIPATED SOLDIER AND THE LUCID CITIZEN SUCCUMB TO THE BARBARIAN. THE DISCOVERY OF LIFE ANNIHILATES LIFE.

WHEN AN ENTIRE NATION, AT VARIOUS LEVELS, IS IN SEARCH OF RARE SENSATIONS, WHEN, BY THE SUBTLETIES OF TASTE, IT COMPLICATES ITS REFLEXES, IT HAS ACCEDED TO A FATAL PITCH OF SUPERIORITY. DECADENCE IS MERELY INSTINCT GONE IMPURE UNDER THE ACTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS. HENCE WE CANNOT OVERESTIMATE THE IMPORTANCE OF GASTRONOMY IN THE EXISTENCE OF A COLLECTIVITY. THE CONSCIOUS ACT OF EATING IS AN ALEXANDRIAN PHENOMENON; BARBARISM FEEDS. INTELLECTUAL AND RELIGIOUS ECLECTICISM, SENSUAL INGENUITY, AESTHETICISM, AND THE LEARNED OBSESSION OF GOOD LIVING ARE THE VARIOUS SIGNS OF ONE AND THE SAME FORM OF MIND. WHEN GABIUS APICIUS EXPLORED THE AFRICAN COAST FOR LOBSTERS, WITHOUT SETTLING ANYWHERE BECAUSE HE FOUND NONE TO HIS TASTE, HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE UNEASY SOULS WHO WORSHIPPED THE HOST OF ALIEN GODS WITHOUT FINDING SATISFACTION OR REST AMONG THEM. RARE SENSATIONS —DIVERSE DEITIES, PARALLEL FRUITS OF THE SAME DRYNESS, OF THE SAME CURIOSITY WITHOUT INNER RESOURCES. CHRISTIANITY APPEARED: A SINGLE GOD—AND FASTING. AND AN AGE OF TRIVIALITY AND THE SUBLIME BEGAN. . . .

A NATION DIES WHEN IT NO LONGER HAS THE STRENGTH TO INVENT NEW GODS, NEW MYTHS, NEW ABSURDITIES; ITS IDOLS BLUR AND VANISH; IT SEEKS THEM ELSEWHERE, AND FEELS ALONE BEFORE UNKNOWN MONSTERS. THIS TOO IS DECADENCE. BUT IF ONE OF THESE MONSTERS PREVAILS, ANOTHER WORLD SETS ITSELF IN MOTION, CRUDE, DIM, INTOLERANT, UNTIL IT EXHAUSTS ITS GOD AND EMANCIPATES ITSELF FROM HIM; FOR MAN IS FREE—AND STERILE—ONLY IN THE INTERVAL WHEN THE GODS DIE; SLAVE—AND CREATIVE—ONLY IN THE INTERVAL WHEN, AS TYRANTS, THEY FLOURISH.

TO MEDITATE UPON ONE’S SENSATIONS—TO KNOW ONE IS EATING—IS AN ACCESSION OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY WHICH AN ELEMENTARY ACTION TRANSCENDS ITS IMMEDIATE GOAL. ALONGSIDE INTELLECTUAL DISGUST DEVELOPS ANOTHER, DEEPER AND MORE DANGEROUS: EMANATING FROM THE VISCERA, IT ENDS AT THE SEVEREST FORM OF NIHILISM, THE NIHILISM OF REPLETION. THE BITTEREST CONSIDERATIONS CANNOT COMPARE, IN THEIR EFFECTS, WITH THE VISION FOLLOWING AN OPULENT BANQUET. EVERY MEAL WHICH EXCEEDS, IN TIME, A FEW MINUTES AND, IN DISHES, THE NECESSITIES DISINTEGRATES OUR CERTITUDES. CULINARY ABUSE AND SATIETY DESTROYED THE EMPIRE MORE PITILESSLY THAN THE ORIENTAL SECTS AND THE ILL-ASSIMILATED GREEK DOCTRINES. WE EXPERIENCE AN AUTHENTIC SHUDDER OF SKEPTICISM ONLY AROUND A COPIOUS TABLE. THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN MUST HAVE REPRESENTED A TEMPTATION AFTER SUCH EXCESSES OR A DELICIOUSLY PERVERSE SURPRISE IN THE MONOTONY OF DIGESTION. HUNGER SEEKS A WAY TO SALVATION IN RELIGION; SATIETY, A POISON. TO BE “SAVED” BY VIRUSES, AND, IN THE INDISCRIMINATION OF PRAYERS AND VICES, TO FLEE THE WORLD AND WALLOW IN IT BY THE SAME ACTION . . . THAT IS INDEED THE APEX OF ACRIMONY AND OF ALEXANDRIANISM.

THERE IS A PLENITUDE OF DECLINE IN EVERY OVERRIPE CIVILIZATION. INSTINCTS SLACKEN; PLEASURES DILATE AND NO LONGER CORRESPOND TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION; THE VOLUPTUOUS BECOMES AN END IN ITSELF, ITS PROLONGATION AN ART, THE AVOIDANCE OF ORGASM A TECHNIQUE, SEXUALITY A SCIENCE. METHODS AND LITERARY INSPIRATIONS TO MULTIPLY THE CHANNELS OF DESIRE, THE IMAGINATION TORMENTED IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY THE PRELIMINARIES OF RELEASE, THE MIND ITSELF INVOLVED IN A REALM ALIEN TO ITS NATURE AND OVER WHICH IT SHOULD HAVE NO PURCHASE—ALL SO MANY SYMPTOMS OF THE IMPOVERISHMENT OF THE BLOOD AND THE MORBID INTELLECTUALIZATION OF THE FLESH. LOVE CONCEIVED AS A RITUAL MAKES THE INTELLIGENCE SOVEREIGN IN THE EMPIRE OF STUPIDITY. OUR AUTOMATISMS SUFFER FOR IT; SHACKLED, THEY LOSE THAT IMPATIENCE TO LET LOOSE AN INADMISSIBLE CONTORTION; THE NERVES BECOME THE THEATER OF LUCID DISCOMFORTS AND SHUDDERS, SENSATION IN SHORT EXTENDS BEYOND ITS CRUDE DURATION THANKS TO THE SKILL OF TWO TORTURERS OF STUDIED VOLUPTUOUSNESS. THEY ARE THE INDIVIDUAL WHO DECEIVES THE SPECIES AND THE BLOOD TOO TEPID TO STUN THE MIND, THE BLOOD CHILLED AND THINNED BY IDEAS, THE RATIONAL BLOOD. . . .

INSTINCTS ERODED BY CONVERSATION. . . .

*

NOTHING MONUMENTAL HAS EVER EMERGED FROM DIALOGUE, NOTHING EXPLOSIVE, NOTHING “GREAT.” IF HUMANITY HAD NOT INDULGED IN DISCUSSING ITS OWN STRENGTH, IT WOULD NEVER HAVE EXCEEDED HOMER’S VISION, AND HIS MODELS. BUT DIALECTICS, RAVAGING THE SPONTANEITY OF REFLEXES AND THE SPIRIT OF MYTHS, HAS REDUCED THE HERO TO A TOTTERING EXAMPLE. TODAY’S ACHILLES HAS MORE THAN A HEEL TO WORRY ABOUT. . . . VULNERABILITY, ONCE PARTIAL AND OF NO CONSEQUENCE, HAS BECOME THE ACCURSED PRIVILEGE, THE ESSENCE OF EACH BEING. CONSCIOUSNESS HAS MADE ITS WAY EVERYWHERE, RESIDING IN THE VERY MARROW OF OUR BONES; HENCE MAN NO LONGER LIVES IN EXISTENCE, BUT IN THE THEORY OF EXISTENCE. . . .

THE CLEAR-SIGHTED PERSON WHO UNDERSTANDS HIMSELF, EXPLAINS HIMSELF, JUSTIFIES HIMSELF, AND DOMINATES HIS ACTIONS WILL NEVER MAKE A MEMORABLE GESTURE. PSYCHOLOGY IS THE HERO’S GRAVE. THE MILLENNIA OF RELIGION AND REASONING HAVE WEAKENED MUSCLES, DECISIONS, AND THE IMPULSE OF RISK. HOW KEEP FROM SCORNING THE ENTERPRISES OF GLORY? EVERY ACT OVER WHICH THE MIND’S LUMINOUS MALEDICTION FAILS TO PRESIDE REPRESENTS A VESTIGE OF ANCESTRAL STUPIDITY. IDEOLOGIES WERE INVENTED ONLY TO GIVE A LUSTER TO THE LEFTOVER BARBARISM WHICH HAS SURVIVED DOWN THROUGH THE AGES, TO COVER UP THE MURDEROUS TENDENCIES COMMON TO ALL MEN. TODAY WE KILL IN THE NAME OF SOMETHING; WE NO LONGER DARE DO SO SPONTANEOUSLY; SO THAT THE VERY EXECUTIONERS MUST INVOKE MOTIVES, AND, HEROISM BEING OBSOLETE, THE MAN WHO IS TEMPTED BY IT SOLVES A PROBLEM MORE THAN HE PERFORMS A SACRIFICE. ABSTRACTION HAS INSINUATED ITSELF INTO LIFE—AND INTO DEATH; THE “COMPLEXES” SEIZE GREAT AND SMALL ALIKE. FROM THE ILIAD TO PSYCHOPATHOBGY—THERE YOU HAVE ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY.

IN CIVILIZATIONS ON THE WANE, TWILIGHT IS THE SIGN OF A NOBLE PUNISHMENT. WHAT ECSTASY OF IRONY THEY MUST EXPERIENCE UPON SEEING THEMSELVES EXCLUDED FROM BECOMING, AFTER HAVING ESTABLISHED FOR CENTURIES THE NORMS OF POWER AND THE CRITERIA OF TASTE! WITH EACH OF THEM, A WHOLE WORLD GOES OUT. SENSATIONS OF THE LAST GREEK, THE LAST ROMAN! WHO CAN KEEP FROM FALLING IN LOVE WITH THE GREAT SUNSETS? THE CHARM OF AGONY SURROUNDING A CIVILIZATION, AFTER IT HAS CONFRONTED EVERY PROBLEM AND MARVELOUSLY WARPED THEM, OFFERS MORE SEDUCTIONS THAN THE INVIOLATE IGNORANCE BY WHICH THAT CIVILIZATION BEGAN.

EACH CIVILIZATION REPRESENTS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTIONS THE UNIVERSE PROPOSES; BUT THE MYSTERY REMAINS INTACT; NEW CIVILIZATIONS, WITH NEW CURIOSITIES, WILL COME TO TRY THEIR LUCK, QUITE AS VAINLY, EACH OF THEM BEING MERELY A SYSTEM OF MISTAKES. . . .

AT THE APOGEE, WE BEGET VALUES; AT TWILIGHT, WORN AND DEFEATED, WE ABOLISH THEM. FASCINATION OF DECADENCE—OF THE AGES WHEN THE TRUTHS HAVE NO FURTHER LIFE . . . WHEN THEY PILE UP LIKE SKELETONS IN THE DESICCATED, PENSIVE SOUL, IN THE BONEYARD OF DREAMS. . . .

HOW DEAR TO ME THAT ALEXANDRIAN PHILOSOPHER NAMED OLIMPIUS, WHO HEARING A VOICE SINGING THE HALLELUJAH IN THE SERAPION, WENT INTO EXILE FOREVER! THIS WAS TOWARD THE END OF THE FOURTH CENTURY; ALREADY THE LUGUBRIOUS STUPIDITY OF THE CROSS WAS CASTING ITS SHADOWS ACROSS THE MIND.

AROUND THE SAME PERIOD, PALLADAS THE GRAMMARIAN COULD WRITE: “WE GREEKS ARE NO MORE THAN ASHES TODAY. OUR HOPES ARE BURIED LIKE THOSE OF THE DEAD.” AND THIS IS TRUE FOR ALL INTELLECTS OF THAT TIME.

VAINLY A CELSUS, A PORPHYRY, A JULIAN THE APOSTATE STRIVES TO HALT THE INVASION OF THAT NEBULOUS SUBLIME WHICH OVERFLOWS THE CATACOMBS: THE APOSTLES HAVE LEFT THEIR STIGMATA IN MEN’S SOULS AND MULTIPLIED THEIR RAVAGES IN THE CITIES. THE AGE OF THE GREAT UGLINESS BEGINS; HYSTERIA WITHOUT QUALITY SPREADS OVER THE WORLD. SAINT PAUL—THE MOST CONSIDERABLE VOTE-CANVASSER OF ALL TIME—HAS MADE HIS TOURS, INFESTING THE CLARITY OF THE ANCIENT TWILIGHT WITH HIS EPISTLES. AN EPILEPTIC TRIUMPHS OVER FIVE CENTURIES OF PHILOSOPHY! REASON IS CONFISCATED BY THE FATHERS OF THE CHURCH!

AND IF I WERE TO LOOK FOR THE MOST MORTIFYING DATE FOR THE MIND’S PRIDE, IF I WERE TO SCAN THE INVENTORY OF INTOLERANCES, I WOULD FIND NOTHING COMPARABLE TO THE YEAR 529, WHEN, FOLLOWING JUSTINIAN’S DECREE, THE SCHOOL OF ATHENS WAS CLOSED. THE RIGHT TO DECADENCE BEING OFFICIALLY SUPPRESSED, TO BELIEVE BECAME AN OBLIGATION. . . . THIS IS THE MOST PAINFUL MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF DOUBT.

WHEN A NATION NO LONGER HAS ANY PREJUDICE IN ITS BLOOD, ITS SOLE RESOURCE REMAINS ITS WILL TO DISINTEGRATE. IMITATING MUSIC, THAT DISCIPLINE OF DISSOLUTION, IT MAKES ITS FAREWELLS TO THE PASSIONS, TO LYRIC WASTE, TO SENTIMENTALITY, TO BLINDNESS. HENCEFORTH IT CAN NO LONGER WORSHIP WITHOUT IRONY: THE SENSE OF DISTANCES WILL BE ITS LOT FOREVER.

PREJUDICE IS AN ORGANIC TRUTH, FALSE IN ITSELF BUT ACCUMULATED BY GENERATIONS AND TRANSMITTED: WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES OF IT WITH IMPUNITY. THE NATION THAT RENOUNCES IT HEEDLESSLY WILL THEN RENOUNCE ITSELF UNTIL IT HAS NOTHING LEFT TO GIVE UP. THE DURATION OF A COLLECTIVITY AND ITS CONSISTENCY COINCIDE WITH THE DURATION AND CONSISTENCY OF ITS PREJUDICES. THE ORIENTAL NATIONS OWE THEIR EVERLASTINGNESS TO THEIR LOYALTY TO THEMSELVES: HAVING FAILED TO “DEVELOP,” THEY HAVE NOT BETRAYED THEMSELVES; AND THEY HAVE NOT LIVED IN THE SENSE IN WHICH LIFE IS CONCEIVED BY CIVILIZATIONS ON THE RUN, THE ONLY ONES HISTORY IS CONCERNED WITH; FOR HISTORY, DISCIPLINE OF DAWNS AND OF GASPING DEATHBEDS—HISTORY IS A NOVEL LAYING CLAIM TO RIGOR AND WHICH DRAWS ITS SUBSTANCE FROM THE ARCHIVES OF THE BLOOD. . . .

ALEXANDRIANISM IS A PERIOD OF SKILFUL NEGATIONS, A STYLE OF IN-UTILITY AND REFUSAL, A DISPLAY OF ERUDITION AND SARCASM ABOVE THE CONFUSION OF VALUES AND BELIEFS. ITS IDEAL SPACE WOULD BE AT THE INTERSECTION OF HELLAS AND BYGONE PARIS, THE MEETING PLACE OF THE AGORA AND THE SALON. A CIVILIZATION EVOLVES FROM AGRICULTURE TO PARADOX. BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES UNFOLDS THE COMBAT OF BARBARISM AND NEUROSIS; FROM IT RESULTS THE UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM OF CREATIVE EPOCHS. THIS COMBAT IS APPROACHING ITS CLOSE: ALL HORIZONS ARE OPENING WITHOUT ANY BEING ABLE TO EXCITE AN EXHAUSTED AND DISABUSED CURIOSITY. IT IS THEN UP TO THE ENLIGHTENED INDIVIDUAL TO FLOURISH IN THE VOID—UP TO THE INTELLECTUAL VAMPIRE TO SLAKE HIS THIRST ON THE VITIATED BLOOD OF CIVILIZATIONS.

MUST WE TAKE HISTORY SERIOUSLY, OR STAND ON THE SIDELINES AS A SPECTATOR? ARE WE TO SEE IT AS A STRUGGLE TOWARD A GOAL OR THE CELEBRATION OF A LIGHT WHICH INTENSIFIES AND FADES WITH NEITHER NECESSITY NOR REASON? THE ANSWER DEPENDS ON OUR DEGREE OF ILLUSION ABOUT MAN, ON OUR CURIOSITY TO DIVINE THE WAY IN WHICH WILL BE RESOLVED THAT MIXTURE OF WALTZ AND SLAUGHTERHOUSE WHICH COMPOSES AND STIMULATES HIS BECOMING.

THERE IS A WELTSCHMERZ, A MAL DU SIÈCK, WHICH IS MERELY THE ILLNESS OF A GENERATION; THERE IS ANOTHER WHICH FOLLOWS UPON ALL HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND WHICH BECOMES THE UNAVOIDABLE CONCLUSION FOR THE TIME TO COME. THIS IS WHAT THE FRENCH CALL VAGUE À LÂME, A MELANCHOLY YEARNING FOR THE END OF THE WORLD. EVERYTHING CHANGES ITS ASPECT, EVEN THE SUN; EVERYTHING AGES, EVEN DISASTER, . . .

INCAPABLE OF RHETORIC, WE ARE ROMANTICS OF LUCID DISAPPOINTMENT. TODAY, WERTHER, MANFRED, RENÉ KNOW THEIR DISEASE AND DISPLAY IT WITHOUT CEREMONY. BIOLOGY, PHYSIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY—GROTESQUE NAMES WHICH, SUPPRESSING THE NAÏVETÉ OF OUR DESPAIR AND INTRODUCING ANALYSIS INTO OUR SONGS, BRING US TO SCORN ALL DECLAMATION. DISCIPLINED BY THE VARIOUS TREATISES, OUR SCHOLARLY ACERBITIES EXPLAIN OUR SHAMES AND CLASSIFY OUR FRENZIES.

WHEN CONSCIOUSNESS SUCCEEDS IN SOUNDING ALL OUR SECRETS, WHEN OUR MISERY HAS BEEN DRAINED OF ITS LAST VESTIGE OF MYSTERY, WILL WE STILL HAVE ANY FEVER AND EXALTATION LEFT TO CONTEMPLATE THE WRECK OF EXISTENCE AND OF POETRY?

TO BEAR THE WEIGHT OF HISTORY, THE BURDEN OF BECOMING AND THAT LOAD UNDER WHICH CONSCIOUSNESS SAGS WHEN IT CONSIDERS THE SUM AND THE INANITY OF PAST OR POSSIBLE EVENTS. .. . IN VAIN NOSTALGIA INVOKES AN IMPULSE IGNORANT OF THE LESSONS TAUGHT BY ALL THAT HAS EVER BEEN; THERE IS A WEARINESS FOR WHICH THE FUTURE ITSELF IS A CEMETERY, A POTENTIAL CEMETERY AS IS EVERYTHING WHICH AWAITS BEING. THE CENTURIES HAVE GROWN HEAVY AND WEIGH UPON THE MOMENT. WE ARE MORE CORRUPT THAN ALL THE AGES, MORE DECOMPOSED THAN ALL THE EMPIRES. OUR EXHAUSTION INTERPRETS HISTORY, OUR BREATHLESSNESS MAKES US HEAR THE DEATH RATTLE OF NATIONS. CHLOROTIC COMEDIANS, WE PREPARE OURSELVES FOR THE STAND-IN PARTS IN THE HACKNEYED STORIES, THE WELL-WORN PERIODS: THE CURTAIN OF THE UNIVERSE IS MOTH-EATEN, AND THROUGH ITS HOLES WE SEE NOTHING, NOW, BUT MASKS AND GHOSTS. . . .

THE MISTAKE OF THOSE WHO APPREHEND DECADENCE IS TO TRY TO OPPOSE IT WHEREAS IT MUST BE ENCOURAGED: BY DEVELOPING IT EXHAUSTS ITSELF AND PERMITS THE ADVENT OF OTHER FORMS. THE TRUE HARBINGER IS NOT THE MAN WHO OFFERS A SYSTEM WHEN NO ONE WANTS IT, BUT RATHER THE MAN WHO PRECIPITATES CHAOS, ITS AGENT AND INCENSE-BEARER. IT IS VULGAR TO TRUMPET DOGMAS IN EXTENUATED AGES WHEN ANY DREAM OF THE FUTURE SEEMS A DREAM OR AN IMPOSTURE. TO MAKE FOR THE END OF TIME WITH A FLOWER IN ONE’S BUTTONHOLE—THE SOLE COMPORTMENT WORTHY OF US IN TIME’S PASSAGE. A PITY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A LAST JUDGMENT, NO OCCASION FOR A GREAT DEFIANCE! BELIEVERS: HAMFATTERS OF ETERNITY; FAITH: CRAVING FOR A TIMELESS STAGE. . . . BUT WE UNBELIEVERS, WE DIE WITH OUR DECORS, AND TOO TIRED OUT TO DECEIVE OURSELVES WITH BLAZONRY PROMISED TO OUR CORPSES. . . .

ACCORDING TO MEISTER ECKHART, DIVINITY PRECEDES GOD, BEING HIS ESSENCE, HIS UNFATHOMABLE DEPTH. WHAT SHOULD WE FIND AT MAN’S INMOST CORE WHICH DEFINES HIS SUBSTANCE IN OPPOSITION TO THE DIVINE ESSENCE? NEURASTHENIA—WHICH IS TO MAN WHAT DIVINITY IS TO GOD.

WE LIVE IN A CLIMATE OF EXHAUSTION: THE ACT OF CREATION, OF MAKING AND PRODUCING, IS LESS SIGNIFICANT IN AND OF ITSELF THAN IN RELATION TO THE VOID, TO THE FALL WHICH FOLLOWS. . . . FOR OUR INVARIABLY COMPROMISED EFFORTS, THE DIVINE AND INEXHAUSTIBLE DEPTHS ARE SITUATED OUTSIDE THE FIELD OF OUR CONCEPTS AND OUR SENSATIONS. MAN WAS BORN WITH THE VOCATION OF FATIGUE: WHEN HE ADOPTED THE VERTICAL POSTURE AND THEREBY DIMINISHED HIS POSSIBILITIES OF SUPPORT, HE WAS DOOMED TO WEAKNESSES UNKNOWN TO THE ANIMAL HE WAS. TO CARRY ON TWO LEGS SO MUCH SUBSTANCE AND ALL THE DISGUSTS RELATED TO IT! THE GENERATIONS ACCUMULATE WEARINESS AND TRANSMIT IT; OUR FATHERS BEQUEATH TO US A PATRIMONY OF ANEMIA, RESERVES OF DISCOURAGEMENT, RESOURCES OF DECOMPOSITION, AND AN ENERGY IN DYING WHICH BECOMES MORE POWERFUL THAN OUR INSTINCTS TO LIVE. AND IT IS IN THIS FASHION THAT THE HABITUDE OF DISAPPEARING, PROPPED ON OUR CAPITAL OF FATIGUE, WILL PERMIT US TO REALIZE, IN THE PROLIX FLESH, NEURASTHENIA—OUR ESSENCE. . . .

NO NEED TO BELIEVE IN A TRUTH TO SUSTAIN IT NOR TO LOVE A PERIOD TO JUSTIFY IT, EVERY PRINCIPLE BEING DEMONSTRABLE AND EVERY EVENT LEGITIMATE. THE SUM OF PHENOMENA—WHETHER FRUITS OF THE MIND OR OF TIME—CAN BE EMBRACED OR DENIED ACCORDING TO OUR MOOD OF THE MOMENT: ARGUMENTS, PROCEEDING FROM OUR RIGOR OR FROM OUR WHIMS, ARE OF EQUAL WEIGHT ON EACH POINT. NOTHING IS INDEFENSIBLE—FROM THE ABSURDEST PROPOSITION TO THE MOST MONSTROUS CRIME. THE HISTORY OF IDEAS, LIKE THAT OF DEEDS, UNFOLDS IN A MEANINGLESS CLIMATE; WHO COULD IN GOOD FAITH FIND AN ARBITER WHO WOULD SETTLE THE LITIGATIONS OF THESE ANEMIC OR BLOODTHIRSTY GORILLAS? THIS EARTH, A PLACE WHERE WE CAN CONFIRM ANYTHING WITH AN EQUAL LIKELIHOOD: HERE AXIOMS AND FRENZIES ARE INTERCHANGEABLE; IMPULSES AND COLLAPSES ARE IDENTIFIED; EXALTATIONS AND DEPRAVITIES PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME MOVEMENT. SHOW ME A SINGLE CASE IN SUPPORT OF WHICH NOTHING CAN BE FOUND. . . . THE ADVOCATES OF HELL HAVE NO FEWER CLAIMS ON THE TRUTH THAN THOSE OF HEAVEN—AND I SHOULD PLEAD THE CAUSE OF MADMAN AND SAGE WITH THE SAME FERVOR. TIME DEALS CORRUPTION TO ALL THAT MANIFESTS ITSELF, ALL THAT ACTS: AN IDEA OR AN EVENT, BECOMING REAL, ASSUMES A COUNTENANCE AND . . . DISINTEGRATES. HENCE, WHEN THE MOB OF BEINGS WAS STIRRED, HISTORY WAS THE RESULT, AND WITH IT THE ONE PURE DESIRE IT HAS INSPIRED: THAT IT COME TO AN END, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

TOO MATURE FOR NEW DAWNS, AND HAVING INCLUDED TOO MANY CENTURIES TO CRAVE MORE, ALL THAT REMAINS FOR US IS TO WALLOW IN THE SLAG OF CIVILIZATIONS. THE MARCH OF TIME NOW SEDUCES ONLY THE CALLOW AND THE FANATIC. . . .

WE ARE THE GREAT INVALIDS, OVERWHELMED BY OLD DREAMS, FOREVER INCAPABLE OF UTOPIA, TECHNICIANS OF LASSITUDE, GRAVEDIGGERS OF THE FUTURE, HORRIFIED BY THE AVATARS OF THE OLD ADAM. THE TREE OF LIFE WILL NO LONGER HAVE SPRING AS ONE OF ITS SEASONS: SO MUCH DRY WOOD; OUT OF IT WILL BE MADE COFFINS FOR OUR BONES, OUR DREAMS, AND OUR GRIEFS. OUR FLESH INHERITED THE SMELL OF LOVELY CARRION SCATTERED IN THE MILLENNIA. THEIR GLORY FASCINATED US; WE EXHAUSTED IT. IN THE MIND’S GRAVEYARD LIE THE PRINCIPLES AND THE FORMULAS: THE BEAUTIFUL IS DEFINED, AND INTERRED THERE. AND LIKE IT THE TRUE, THE GOOD, KNOWLEDGE, AND THE GODS—THEY ARE ALL ROTTING THERE. (HISTORY: A CONTEXT IN WHICH THE CAPITAL LETTERS DECOMPOSE, AND WITH THEM, THE MEN WHO IMAGINE AND CHERISH THEM.)

.. . I STROLL THERE. UNDER THIS CROSS TRUTH SLEEPS ITS LAST SLEEP; BESIDE IT, CHARM; FURTHER ON, RIGOR; AND OVER A HOST OF SLABS COVERED WITH DELIRIUMS AND HYPOTHESES RISES THE MAUSOLEUM OF THE ABSOLUTE; IN IT LIE THE FALSE CONSOLATIONS AND THE DECEPTIVE ZENITHS OF THE SOUL. BUT, STILL HIGHER, CROWNING THIS SILENCE, SOARS ERROR—AND HALTS THE STEPS OF THE FUNEREAL SOPHIST.

SINCE MAN’S EXISTENCE IS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE AND THE STRANGEST VENTURE NATURE HAS KNOWN, IT IS INEVITABLE THAT IT SHOULD ALSO BE THE SHORTEST; ITS END IS FORESEEABLE AND DESIRABLE: TO EXTEND IT INDEFINITELY WOULD BE INDECENT. HAVING ENTERED UPON THE RISKS OF HIS EXCEPTION, THE PARADOXICAL ANIMAL WILL STILL PLAY, FOR CENTURIES AND EVEN FOR MILLENNIA, HIS LAST CARD MUST WE COMPLAIN OF THAT? NO QUESTION THAT HE WILL NEVER EQUAL HIS PAST GLORIES, NOTHING SUGGESTS THAT HIS POSSIBILITIES WILL SOME DAY PROVOKE A RIVAL FOR BACH OR FOR SHAKESPEARE DECADENCE IS FIRST MANIFEST IN THE ARTS; “CIVILIZATION” SURVIVES THEIR DECOMPOSITION A CERTAIN TIME SUCH WILL BE MAN’S CASE: HE WILL CONTINUE HIS EXPLOITS, BUT HIS SPIRITUAL RESOURCES WILL HAVE DRIED UP, AS WILL HIS FRESHNESS OF INSPIRATION THE THIRST FOR POWER AND DOMINATION HAS TAKEN OVER TOO MUCH OF HIS SOUL: WHEN HE IS MASTER OF ALL, HE WILL BE NONE THE MORE SO OF HIS OWE END. NOT YET BEING THE POSSESSOR OF ALL THE MEANS TO DESTROY AND TO DESTROY HIMSELF, HE WILL NOT PERISH FORTHWITH; BUT IT IS INDUBITABLE THAT HE WILL CREATE FOR HIMSELF AN INSTRUMENT OF TOTAL ANNIHILATION BEFORE DISCOVERING A PANACEA, WHICH MOREOVER DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ONE OF NATURE’S POSSIBILITIES. HE WILL ANNIHILATE HIMSELF AS A CREATOR—ARE WE TO CONCLUDE THAT ALL MEN WILL VANISH FROM THE EARTH? WE MUST NOT LOOK AT THE SITUATION THROUGH ROSE-COLORED GLASSES. A GOOD PROPORTION, THE SURVIVORS, WILL LINGER ON, A RACE OF SUBHUMANS, GATE-CRASHERS OF THE APOCALYPSE . .

THE IMAGINATION READILY CONCEIVES A FUTURE IN WHICH MEN WILL EXCLAIM IN CHORUS: “WE ARE THE LAST: WEARY OF THE FUTURE, AND EVEN WEARIER OF OURSELVES, WE HAVE SQUEEZED OUT THE JUICE FROM THE EARTH AND STRIPPED BARE THE HEAVENS NEITHER SPIRIT NOR MATTER CAN STILL NOURISH OUR DREAMS: THIS UNIVERSE IS AS DESICCATED AS OUR HEARTS NO SUBSTANCE REMAINS ANYWHERE: OUR ANCESTORS BEQUEATHED US THEIR TATTERED SOUL AND THEIR WORM-EATEN MARROW. THE VENTURE IS AT AN END; CONSCIOUSNESS IS EXPIRING; OUR SONGS HAVE FALLEN STILL; THERE GLEAMS THE SUN OF THE DYING!”

IF, BY ACCIDENT OR MIRACLE, WORDS WERE TO DISAPPEAR, WE SHOULD BE PLUNGED INTO AN INTOLERABLE ANGUISH AND STUPOR. SUCH SUDDEN DUMBNESS WOULD EXPOSE US TO THE CRUDEST TORMENT. IT IS THE USE OF CONCEPTS WHICH MAKES US MASTERS OF OUR FEARS. WE SAY: DEATH—AND THIS ABSTRACTION RELEASES US FROM EXPERIENCING ITS INFINITY, ITS HORROR. BY BAPTIZING EVENTS AND THINGS, WE ELUDE THE INEXPLICABLE: THE MIND’S ACTIVITY IS A SALUTARY DECEPTION, A CONJURING TRICK; IT ALLOWS US TO CIRCULATE IN A TEMPERED REALITY, COMFORTABLE AND INEXACT. TO ¡EARN TO WIELD CONCEPTS—UNLEARN TO LOOK AT THINGS. . . . REFLECTION WAS BORN ON A DAY OF EVASION; THE CONSEQUENCE WAS VERBAL SPLENDOR. BUT WHEN WE RETURN TO OURSELVES AND WE ARE ALONE—-WITHOUT THE COMPANY OF WORDS—WE REDISCOVER THE UNQUALIFIED UNIVERSE, THE PURE OBJECT, THE NAKED EVENT; WHERE FIND THE BOLDNESS TO FACE THEM? WE NO LONGER SPECULATE ABOUT DEATH, WE ARE DEATH; INSTEAD OF EMBELLISHING LIFE AND ASSIGNING IT GOALS, WE STRIP IT OF ITS FINERY AND REDUCE IT TO ITS TRUE MEANING: A EUPHEMISM FOR EVIL THE GRAND EXPRESSIONS—FATE, MISFORTUNE, DISGRACE—LOSE THEIR LUSTER; AND IT IS THEN THAT WE SEE THE CREATURE AT GRIPS WITH FAILING ORGANS, VANQUISHED UNDER A PROSTRATE AND DUMBFOUNDED SUBSTANCE. TAKE THE LIE OF MISERY AWAY FROM MAN, GIVE HIM THE POWER TO LOOK UNDER THIS WORD: HE CANNOT, FOR ONE MOMENT, ENDURE HIS MISERY. IT IS ABSTRACTION, SONORITIES WITHOUT CONTENT, SWOLLEN AND DILAPIDATED, WHICH HAVE KEPT HIM FROM FOUNDERING, AND NOT HIS RELIGIONS AND INSTINCTS.

WHEN ADAM WAS EXPELLED FROM PARADISE, INSTEAD OF VITUPERATING HIS PERSECUTOR, HE BUSIED HIMSELF BAPTIZING THINGS: THIS WAS HIS SOLE WAY OF ACCOMMODATING HIMSELF TO THEM AND FORGETTING THEM; THE BASIS OF IDEALISM WAS ESTABLISHED. AND WHAT WAS ONLY A GESTURE, A DEFENSE REACTION IN THE FIRST STAMMERER BECAME THEORY IN PLATO, KANT, AND HEGEL.

IN ORDER NOT TO BE OVERWHELMED BY OUR ACCIDENT, WE CONVERT EVEN OUR NAME INTO AN ENTITY: HOW CAN WE DIE WHEN WE ARE CALLED PETER OR PAUL? EACH OF US, MORE ATTENTIVE TO THE IMMUTABLE APPEARANCE OF HIS NAME THAN TO THE FRAGILITY OF HIS BEING, GIVES HIMSELF UP TO AN ILLUSION OF IMMORTALITY; ONCE THE ARTICULATION BLURS, WE ARE QUITE ALONE; THE MYSTIC WHO WEDS SILENCE HAS RENOUNCED HIS CREATURE CONDITION. IMAGINE HIM, FURTHER, WITHOUT FAITH—A NIHILIST MYSTIC—AND WE HAVE THE DISASTROUS CONSUMMATION OF THE EARTHLY VENTURE.

.. . IT IS ONLY TOO NATURAL TO THINK THAT MAN, WEARY OF WORDS, IMPATIENT WITH THE ITERATIONS OF TIME, WILL DEBAPTIZE THINGS AND CAST THEIR NAMES AND HIS OWN INTO A GREAT AUTO-DA-FÉ THAT WILL ENGULF HIS HOPES. WE ALL RACE TOWARD THIS FINAL MODEL, TOWARD MAN MUTE AND NAKED. . . .

*

I FEEL LIFE’S AGE, ITS OLD AGE, ITS DECREPITUDE. FOR INCALCULABLE EPOCHS, LIFE HAS CIRCLED THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BY THE MIRACLE OF THAT FALSE IMMORTALITY WHICH IS INERTIA; IT HAS LINGERED IN THE RHEUMATISMS OF TIME, IN THAT TIME OLDER THAN ITSELF, EXHAUSTED BY A SENILE DELIRIUM, BY THE ENDLESS SIFTING OF ITS MOMENTS, OF ITS DOTING DURATION.

AND I FEEL ALL THE WEIGHT OF THE RACE, AND I HAVE ASSUMED ALL ITS SOLITUDE. IF ONLY IT WOULD VANISH!—BUT ITS AGONY EXTENDS TOWARD AN ETERNITY OF CORRUPTION. I LEAVE EACH MOMENT THE LATITUDE TO DESTROY ME: NOT TO BLUSH AT BREATHING IS THE ACT OF A CAD. NO MORE PACTS WITH LIFE, NO MORE PACTS WITH DEATH: HAVING UNLEARNED BEING, I CONSENT TO BE EFFACED. BECOMING—WHAT A CRIME!

HAVING PASSED THROUGH SO MANY LUNGS, THE AIR NO LONGER RENEWS ITSELF. EVERY DAY VOMITS UP ITS TOMORROW, AND I VAINLY TRY TO IMAGINE THE IMAGE OF A SINGLE DESIRE. EVERYTHING IS AN ORDEAL: BROKEN DOWN LIKE A BEAST OF BURDEN HARNESSED TO MATTER, I DRAG THE PLANETS.

GIVE ME ANOTHER UNIVERSE—OR I SUCCUMB.

ALL I LIKE IS THE EXPLOSION AND THE COLLAPSE OF THINGS, THE FIRE WHICH PROVOKES THEM AND THE FIRE WHICH DEVOURS THEM. THE WORLD’S DURATION EXASPERATES ME; ITS BIRTH AND ITS DISAPPEARANCE DELIGHT. .. . TO LIVE UNDER THE FASCINATION OF THE VIRGINAL SUN AND THE DECREPIT ONE; TO SKIP THE PULSATIONS OF TIME IN ORDER TO GRASP THE ORIGINAL ONE AND THE ULTIMATE .. . TO DREAM OF THE IMPROVISATION OF THE STARS AND OF THEIR EXTINCTION; TO DISDAIN THE ROUTINE OF BEING AND TO RUSH TOWARD THE TWO ABYSSES WHICH THREATEN IT; TO EXHAUST ONESELF AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE MOMENTS. . .

THUS ONE DISCOVERS THE SAVAGE AND THE DECADENT IN ONESELF, A PREDESTINED AND CONTRADICTORY COHABITATION: TWO CHARACTERS SUFFERING THE SAME ATTRACTION FOR PASSAGE, THE ONE OF NOTHINGNESS TOWARD THE WORLD, THE OTHER OF THE WORLD TOWARD NOTHINGNESS: IT IS THE NEED FOR A DOUBLE CONVULSION, ON THE METAPHYSICAL SCALE. THIS NEED IS EXPRESSED, ON THE HISTORICAL SCALE, IN THE OBSESSION OF ADAM WHOM PARADISE EXPELLED AND IN THE OBSESSION OF THE MAN WHOM EARTH WILL EXPEL: TWO EXTREMITIES OF MAN’S IMPOSSIBILITY.

BY WHAT IS “PROFOUND” IN US, WE ARE VICTIMS OF EVERY EVIL: NO SALVATION SO LONG AS WE STILL CONFORM TO OUR BEING. SOMETHING MUST DISAPPEAR FROM OUR COMPOSITION, SOME DEADLY SPRING DRY UP; HENCE THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY OUT: TO ABOLISH THE SOUL, ITS ASPIRATIONS AND ABYSSES; OUR DREAMS WERE POISONED BY IT; WE MUST EXTIRPATE IT, ALONG WITH ITS CRAVING FOR “DEPTH,” ITS “INNER” FRUITFULNESS, AND ITS OTHER ABERRATIONS. THE MIND AND SENSATION WILL SUFFICE; THEIR CONCOURSE WILL BEGET A DISCIPLINE OF STERILITY WHICH WILL PRESERVE US FROM ENTHUSIASM, FROM ANGUISH. LET NO “FEELING” DISTURB US EVER AGAIN, AND LET THE “SOUL” BECOME THE SILLIEST OF DESUETUDES. . . .

SANCTITY AND THE GRIMACES OF THE ABSOLUTE
THE REFUSAL TO PROCREATE—THE AESTHETE HAGIOGRAPHER—THE DISCIPLE OF CERTAIN SAINTS—WISDOM AND SANCTITY—WOMAN AND THE ABSOLUTE—SPAIN HYSTERIA OF ETERNITY—STAGES OF PRIDE—HEAVEN AND HYGIENE—ON CERTAIN SOLITUDES—OSCILLATION THREAT OF SANCTITY—THE TILTING CROSS—THEOLOGY—THE METAPHYSICAL ANIMAL—GENESIS OF MELANCHOLY—DIVAGATIONS IN A MONASTERY EXERCISE OF INSUBMISSION

YES, TRULY, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE DEMONS ARE PLAYING HALL WITH MY SOUL . . .

—TERESA OF AVILA

THE REFUSAL TO PROCREATE
HAVING EXHAUSTED HIS APPETITES, THE MAN WHO APPROACHES A LIMIT-FORM OF DETACHMENT NO LONGER WANTS TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF; HE LOATHES SURVIVING IN SOMEONE ELSE, TO WHOM MOREOVER HE HAS NOTHING MORE TO TRANSMIT; THE SPECIES APPALLS HIM; HE IS A MONSTER—AND MONSTERS DO NOT BEGET. “LOVE” STILL HOLDS HIM PRISONER: AN ABERRATION AMONG HIS THOUGHTS. IN LOVE HE SEEKS AN EXCUSE TO RETURN TO THE COMMON CONDITION; BUT THE CHILD SEEMS AS INCONCEIVABLE TO HIM AS THE FAMILY, AS HEREDITY, AS THE LAWS OF NATURE. WITH NEITHER PROFESSION NOR LINEAGE, HE ACHIEVES—FINAL HYPOSTASIS—HIS OWN CONCLUSION. BUT FAR AS HE MAY BE FROM FECUNDITY, A MORE AUDACIOUS MONSTER OUTSTRIPS HIM: THE SAINT, AN EXAMPLE AT ONCE FASCINATING AND REPELLENT, WITH WHOM WE ARE ALWAYS IN A FALSE POSITION; HIS OWN IS CLEAR: NO ROOM FOR DOUBT, NO POSSIBLE DILETTANTISM. HAVING REACHED THE GILDED PEAKS OF HIS DISGUSTS, AT THE ANTIPODES OF CREATION, HE HAS MADE HIS NOTHINGNESS INTO A HALO. NATURE HAS NEVER KNOWN SUCH A CALAMITY: FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF PERPETUATION, THE SAINT MARKS AN ABSOLUTE END, A RADICAL DENOUEMENT. TO REGRET, LIKE LÉON BLOY, THAT WE ARE NOT ALL SAINTS IS TO CRAVE HUMANITY’S DISAPPEARANCE . . . IN THE NAME OF FAITH! HOW POSITIVE, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DEVIL APPEARS, STRIVING TO SEAL US TO OUR IMPERFECTIONS AND LABORING—DESPITE HIMSELF, BETRAYING HIS ESSENCE—TO PRESERVE US! ROOT OUT SINS AND LIFE WITHERS AT ONCE. THE FOLLIES OF PROCREATION WILL ONE DAY VANISH—OUT OF WEARINESS RATHER THAN SANCTITY. MAN WILL BE EXHAUSTED LESS FOR HAVING TENDED TO PERFECTION THAN FOR HAVING SQUANDERED HIMSELF; THEN HE WILL RESEMBLE A VOID SAINT, AND HE WILL BE JUST AS FAR FROM NATURE’S FRUITFULNESS AS IS THIS MODEL OF FULFILLMENT AND STERILITY.

MAN ENGENDERS ONLY BY REMAINING FAITHFUL TO THE GENERAL FATE. ONCE HE APPROACHES THE ESSENCE OF THE DEVIL OR OF THE ANGEL HE BECOMES STERILE OR BEGETS ABORTIONS. FOR EASKOLEIKOV, FOR IVAN KARAMAZOV OR STAVROGIN, LOVE IS NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT AN EXCUSE TO ACCELERATE THEIR DESTRUCTION; AND THIS VERY EXCUSE VANISHES FOR KIRILOV: HE NO LONGER MEASURES HIMSELF AGAINST MEN BUT AGAINST GOD, AS FOR THE IDIOT OR ALYOSHA, THE FACT THAT THE ONE APES JESUS AND THE OTHER THE ANGELS PLACES THEM FROM THE START AMONG THE IMPOTENT . . .

BUT TO WREST OURSELVES FROM THE CHAIN OF BEINGS AND TO REJECT THE NOTION OF ANCESTRY OR POSTERITY IS NONETHELESS NOT TO COMPETE WITH THE SAINT, WHOSE PRIDE EXCEEDS ANY EARTHLY DIMENSION. INDEED, UNDER THE DECISION BY WHICH HE RENOUNCES EVERYTHING, UNDER THE INCOMMENSURABLE EXPLOIT OF SUCH HUMILITY, IS CONCEALED A DEMONIC EFFERVESCENCE: THE INITIAL POINT, THE START OF SANCTITY, ASSUMES THE STYLE OF A CHALLENGE HURLED AT THE HUMAN RACE; SUBSEQUENTLY THE SAINT CLIMBS THE LADDER OF PERFECTION, BEGINS TALKING ABOUT LOVE, ABOUT GOD, TURNS TOWARD THE HUMBLE, INTRIGUES THE MOB—AND ANNOYS US. THE FACT NONETHELESS REMAINS THAT HE HAS THROWN DOWN HIS GAUNTLET. . . .

THE HATRED OF THE “RACE” AND OF ITS “GENIUS” RELATES YOU TO MURDERERS, TO MADMEN, TO DIVINITIES, AND TO ALL THE GREAT FORMS OF THE STERILE. STARTING FROM A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SOLITUDE, YOU MUST LEAVE OFF LOVING AND COMMITTING THE FASCINATING POLLUTION OF INTERCOURSE. THE MAN WHO WANTS TO PERPETUATE HIMSELF AT ANY PRICE IS SCARCELY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THE DOG: HE IS STILL NATURE; HE WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND THAT WE CAN ENDURE THE EMPIRE OF THE INSTINCTS AND REBEL AGAINST THEM, ENJOY THE ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIES AND SCORN THEM: END OF THE LINE—WITH APPETITES. . . . THAT IS THE CONFLICT OF THE MAN WHO WORSHIPS AND ABOMINATES WOMAN, SUPREMELY TORN BETWEEN THE ATTRACTION AND DISGUST SHE INSPIRES. HENCE, UNABLE TO RENOUNCE THE RACE ALTOGETHER, HE RESOLVES THIS CONFLICT BY DREAMING, ON HER BREAST, OF THE DESERT AND BY MINGLING THE SCENT OF THE CLOISTERS WITH THE STENCH OF OVER-EXPLICIT SWEAT. THE INSINCERITIES OF THE FLESH BRING HIM CLOSER TO THE SAINTS. . . .

SOLITUDE OF HATRED . . . SENSATION OF A GOD TURNED TOWARD DESTRUCTION, TREADING THE SPHERES UNDERFOOT, SLOBBERING ON THE BLUE OF HEAVEN AND ITS CONSTELLATIONS . . . OF A FRENZIED, FILTHY, UNHEALTHY GOD; THE DEMIURGE EJECTING, THROUGH SPACE, PARADISE, AND LATRINES; COSMOGONY OF DELIRIUM TREMENS; CONVULSIVE APOTHEOSIS IN WHICH GALL CONSUMMATES THE ELEMENTS. . . . THE CREATURES HURL THEMSELVES TOWARD AN ARCHETYPE OF UGLINESS AND SIGH FOR AN IDEAL OF DEFORMITY.

. . . UNIVERSE OF GRIMACES, JUBILATION OF THE MOLE, THE HYENA, AND THE LOUSE. . . . NO HORIZON LEFT, EXCEPT FOR MONSTERS AND VERMIN. EVERYTHING MAKES FOR DISGUST AND GANGRENE: THIS GLOBE SUPPURATING WHILE THE LIVING DISPLAY THEIR WOUNDS UNDER THE BEAMS OF THAT LUMINOUS CHANCRE. . . .

THE AESTHETE HAGIOGRAPHER
IT IS NO SIGN OF BENEDICTION TO HAVE BEEN HAUNTED BY THE EXISTENCE OF THE SAINTS. THIS OBSESSION IS TAINTED BY A THIRST FOR DISEASES AND A GREED FOR DEPRAVITIES. YOU ARE DISTURBED ABOUT SANCTITY ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED BY THE EARTHLY PARADOXES; SO THEN YOU SEARCH FOR OTHERS, OF A STRANGER PURPORT, IMBUED WITH UNKNOWN PERFUMES AND TRUTHS; YOU PUT YOUR HOPES IN FOLLIES NOT TO BE FOUND IN EVERYDAY SENSATIONS, FOLLIES HEAVY WITH A CELESTIAL EXOTICISM; AND SO YOU COME UP AGAINST THE SAINTS, THEIR GESTURES, THEIR TEMERITY, THEIR UNIVERSE. ASTOUNDING SPECTACLE! YOU VOW TO REMAIN HERE ALL YOUR LIFE, TO EXAMINE IT WITH A VOLUPTUOUS DEVOTION, TO WREST YOURSELF FROM OTHER TEMPTATIONS BECAUSE AT LAST YOU HAVE MET WITH THE TRUE AND THE UNHEARD OF. BEHOLD THE AESTHETE TURNED HAGIOGRAPHER, MAKING HIS SCHOLARLY PILGRIMAGE. . . . HE MAKES IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING THAT IT IS NO MORE THAN A PROMENADE AND THAT EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD DISAPPOINTS, EVEN SANCTITY. . . .

THE DISCIPLE OF CERTAIN SAINTS
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN TO PRONOUNCE MERELY THE NAME OF A SAINT, A SAINT WHO HAPPENED TO BE A WOMAN, FILLED ME WITH PLEASURE—WHEN I ENVIED THE CHRONICLERS OF THE CONVENTS, THE INTIMATES OF SO MANY INEFFABLE HYSTERIAS, SO MANY ILLUMINATIONS AND PALLORS. I CONSIDERED THAT TO BE THE SECRETARY OF SUCH A WOMAN, SUCH A SAINT, WOULD CONSTITUTE THE HIGHEST CAREER A MORTAL MAN COULD ENJOY. AND I WOULD COVET THE CONFESSOR’S ROLE AMONG THESE BLESSED ENTHUSIASTS, AND ALL THE DETAILS, ALL THE SECRETS A PETER OF ALVASTRA KEPT FROM US ABOUT SAINT BRIDGET OF SWEDEN, HENRY OF NORDLINGEN ABOUT MECHTHILD OF MAGDEBURG, RAYMOND OF CAPUA ABOUT CATHERINE OF SIENA, BROTHER ARNOLD ABOUT ANGELA OF FOLIGNO, JOHANN OF MARIENWERDER ABOUT DOROTHEA OF MONTAU, CLEMENS BRENTANO ABOUT CATHERINE EMMERICH. . . . IT SEEMED TO ME THAT A DIODATA DEGLI ADEMARI OR A DIANA OF ANDOLO ROSE UP TO HEAVEN BY THE SIMPLE GLAMOR OF THEIR NAMES: THEY GAVE ME THE SENSUAL TASTE FOR ANOTHER WORLD.

WHEN I MUSED ON THE ORDEALS OF ROSE OF LIMA, OF LYDWINA OF SCHIEDAM, OF CATHERINE DEI RICCI, AND OF SO MANY OTHERS, WHEN I THOUGHT OF THEIR REFINEMENT OF CRUELTY TOWARD THEMSELVES, OF THE DELIBERATE MORTIFICATION OF THEIR CHARMS AND GRACES—1 DETESTED THE PARASITE OF THEIR PANGS, THE UNSCRUPULOUS BRIDEGROOM, INSATIABLE AND CELESTIAL DON JUAN WHO HAD THE RIGHT OF FIRST TENANT IN THEIR HEARTS. EXASPERATED BY THE SIGHS AND SWEATS OF EARTHLY LOVE, I TURNED TO THESE WOMEN, IF ONLY FOR THEIR PURSUIT OF ANOTHER MODE OF LOVING. “IF BUT ONE DROP OF WHAT I FEEL,” SAID CATHERINE OF GENOA, “WERE TO FALL INTO HELL, IT WOULD FORTHWITH TRANSFORM HELL INTO PARADISE.” I WAITED FOR THAT DROP WHICH, HAD IT FALLEN, WOULD HAVE FOUND ME AT THE END OF ITS TRAJECTORY. . . .

MURMURING OVER THE EXCLAMATIONS OF TERESA OF AVILA, I HEARD HER CRYING AT THE AGE OF SIX, “ETERNITY, ETERNITY,” THEN FOLLOWED THE DEVELOPMENT OF HER DELIRIUMS, OF HER DEVOTIONS, OF HER DESICCATIONS. NOTHING MORE CAPTIVATING THAN THE PRIVATE REVELATIONS WHICH DISCONCERT THE DOGMAS AND EMBARRASS THE CHURCH. . . . I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO KEEP A JOURNAL OF THOSE EQUIVOCAL AVOWALS, TO BROWSE ON ALL THOSE SUSPECT NOSTALGIAS. .. . IT IS NOT IN A BED THAT THE PEAKS OF VOLUPTUOUS PLEASURE ARE TO BE SCALED: HOW FIND IN MERE SUBLUNARY ECSTASY WHAT THE SAINTS LET YOU SUSPECT IN THEIR RAVISHMENT, IN THEIR TRANSPORTS? BERNINI HAS SHOWN US THE QUALITY OF THEIR SECRETS IN HIS STATUE OF THE SPANISH SAINT IN ROME, WHERE TERESA INCITES US TO SO MANY CONSIDERATIONS AS TO THE AMBIGUITY OF HER SWOONS. . . .

WHEN I THINK AGAIN ABOUT MY DEBTS FOR AN AWARENESS OF THESE EXTREMITIES OF PASSION, THESE DARKEST YET PUREST RAPTURES, AND THAT KIND OF ABSENCE WHEN THE NIGHTS CATCH FIRE, WHEN THE MEREST BLADE OF GRASS, LIKE THE STARS THEMSELVES, DISSOLVES INTO A VOICE OF TONIC INTENSITY—INSTANTANEOUS INFINITY, INCANDESCENT AND SONOROUS AS A RADIANT AND DEMENTED GOD MIGHT CONCEIVE IT—WHEN I THINK AGAIN ABOUT ALL THIS, A SINGLE NAME HAUNTS ME: TERESA OF AVILA—AND THE WORDS OF ONE OF HER REVELATIONS I USED TO REPEAT TO MYSELF DAILY: “YOU MUST NO LONGER SPEAK WITH MEN BUT WITH ANGELS.”

I LIVED FOR YEARS IN THE SHADOW OF THESE WOMEN, THESE SAINTS, BELIEVING THAT NO POET, SAGE, OR MADMAN WOULD EVER EQUAL THEM. I EXPENDED, IN MY FERVOR FOR THEM, ALL MY POWERS OF WORSHIP, MY VITALITY IN DESIRE, MY ARDOR IN DREAMS. AND THEN . . . I STOPPED LOVING THEM.

WISDOM AND SANCTITY
OF ALL THE GREAT SUFFERERS, THE SAINTS ARE BEST AT PROFITING FROM THEIR SICKNESS. WILLFUL, UNBRIDLED NATURES, THEY EXPLOIT THEIR OWN DISEQUILIBRIUM WITH VIOLENCE AND SKILL. THE SAVIOR, THEIR MODEL, WAS AN EXAMPLE OF AMBITION AND AUDACITY, A MATCHLESS CONQUEROR: HIS INSINUATING FORCE, HIS POWER TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH THE SOUL’S FLAWS AND INSUFFICIENCIES ALLOWED HIM TO ESTABLISH A KINGDOM BEYOND THE REACH OF ANY MERE SWORD. ARDENT WITH METHOD: IT IS THIS ABILITY WHICH WAS IMITATED BY THOSE WHO TOOK HIM FOR THEIR IDEAL.

BUT THE SAGE, SCORNFUL OF DRAMA AND DISPLAY, FEELS QUITE AS REMOTE FROM THE SAINT AS FROM THE REVELER, KNOWS NOTHING OF THE HISTRIONIC AND FORGES FOR HIMSELF AN EQUILIBRIUM OF DISILLUSION AND UNCONCERN. PASCAL IS A SAINT WITHOUT TEMPERAMENT: SICKNESS HAS MADE HIM A LITTLE MORE THAN A SAGE, A LITTLE LESS THAN A SAINT. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR HIS OSCILLATIONS AND THE SKEPTICAL SHADOW THAT FOLLOWS HIS FERVORS. A BEL ESPRIT IN THE INCURABLE. . . .

FROM THE SAGE’S VIEWPOINT, THERE CAN BE NO ONE MORE IMPURE THAN THE SAINT; FROM THE SAINT’S, NO ONE EMPTIER THAN THE SAGE. HERE WE HAVE THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS AND THE MAN WHO ASPIRES.

WOMAN AND THE ABSOLUTE
“WHILE OUR LORD SPOKE TO ME AND I CONTEMPLATED HIS MARVELOUS BEAUTY, I NOTICED THE SWEETNESS AND AT TIMES THE SEVERITY WITH WHICH HIS LOVELY AND DIVINE LIPS UTTERED THE WORDS. I DESIRED ARDENTLY TO KNOW THE COLOR OF HIS EYES AND THE PROPORTIONS OF HIS STATURE, THAT I MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK OF THEM: BUT NEVER HAVE I DESERVED TO HAVE SUCH KNOWLEDGE. ALL EFFORT TO THAT END IS OF NO AVAIL."—SAINT TERESA.

THE COLOR OF HIS EYES. . . . IMPURITIES OF FEMALE SANCTITY! TO CARRY THE INDISCRETION OF HER SEX UP TO HEAVEN ITSELF—THAT IS OF A NATURE TO CONSOLE AND COMPENSATE ANY MAN—AND BETTER STILL, ANY WOMAN—WHO HAS REMAINED OUTSIDE THE DIVINE ADVENTURE. THE FIRST MAN, THE FIRST WOMAN: THAT IS THE ESSENCE OF THE FALL WHICH NOTHING, GENIUS NOR SANCTITY, WILL EVER REDEEM. WHO HAS EVER SEEN A NEW MAN TOTALLY SUPERIOR TO THE ONE HE WAS? FOR JESUS HIMSELF, THE TRANSFIGURATION MAY HAVE MEANT ONLY A FUGITIVE EVENT, A DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES. . . .

BETWEEN SAINT TERESA AND OTHER WOMEN, THEN, THERE IS NO MORE THAN A DIFFERENCE IN CAPACITY FOR DELIRIUM, A QUESTION OF THE INTENSITY AND DIRECTION OF CAPRICE. LOVE—HUMAN OR DIVINE—LEVELS HUMAN BEINGS: TO LOVE A GIRL OR TO LOVE GOD PRESUPPOSES THE SAME MOVEMENT: IN BOTH CASES, YOU FOLLOW A CREATURELY IMPULSE. ONLY THE OBJECT CHANGES; BUT WHAT INTEREST DOES IT OFFER, ONCE IT IS MERELY A PRETEXT FOR THE NEED TO WORSHIP, ONCE GOD IS MERELY ONE OUTLET AMONG SO MANY OTHERS?

SPAIN
EACH NATION TRANSLATES THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES INTO PROCESS IN ITS OWN WAY, YET SPAIN’S ARDOR REMAINS UNIQUE; HAD THE REST OF THE WORLD SHARED IT, GOD WOULD BE EXHAUSTED, DRAINED, AND DEPRIVED OF HIMSELF. IT IS IN ORDER NOT TO VANISH THAT HE MAKES ATHEISM PROSPER IN HIS COUNTRIES—OUT OF SELF-DEFENSE. FEARING THE FLAMES HE HAS INSPIRED, HE REACTS AGAINST HIS SONS, AGAINST THEIR FRENZY WHICH DIMINISHES HIM; THEIR LOVE UNDERMINES HIS POWER AND HIS AUTHORITY; ONLY UNBELIEF LEAVES HIM INTACT; IT IS NOT DOUBTS WHICH ERODE GOD, BUT FAITH. FOR CENTURIES THE CHURCH HAS TRIVIALIZED HIS PRESTIGE, AND BY MAKING HIM ACCESSIBLE, IS PREPARING FOR HIM, THANKS TO THEOLOGY, A DEATH WITHOUT ENIGMAS, A GLOSSED, ENLIGHTENED AGONY: OVERWHELMED BY THE WEIGHT OF PRAYERS, HOW COULD HE HELP BEING STILL MORE SO BY THAT OF EXPLANATIONS? HE DREADS SPAIN AS HE DREADS RUSSIA—AND MULTIPLIES ATHEISTS IN BOTH. THEIR ATTACKS AT LEAST LET HIM RETAIN THE ILLUSION OF OMNIPOTENCE: STILL AN ATTRIBUTE PRESERVED! BUT THE BELIEVERS! DOSTOYEVSKY, EL GRECO: HAS HE EVER HAD MORE FEVERISH ENEMIES? AND HOW COULD HE KEEP FROM PREFERRING BAUDELAIRE TO JOHN OF THE CROSS? HE FEARS THOSE WHO SEE HIM AND THOSE THROUGH WHOM HE SEES.

ALL SANCTITY IS MORE OR LESS SPANISH: IF GOD WERE A CYCLOPS, SPAIN WOULD BE HIS EYE.

HYSTERIA OF ETERNITY
I CAN CONCEDE A CERTAIN RELISH FOR THE CROSS, BUT TO REPRODUCE, AND DAILY, THE STALE EVENT OF CALVARY—THAT PARTAKES OF THE WONDROUS, THE INANE, AND THE STUPID. FOR AFTER ALL THE SAVIOR, IF WE ABUSE HIS PRESTIGE, IS AS TIRESOME AS ANYONE ELSE.

THE SAINTS WERE GREAT PERVERTS, THE WOMEN AMONG THEM MAGNIFICENT VOLUPTUARIES. ALL OF THEM—FRENZIED BY A SINGLE IDEA TRANSFORMED THE CROSS INTO A VICE. “DEPTH” IS THE DIMENSION OF THOSE WHO CANNOT VARY THEIR THOUGHTS AND THEIR APPETITES, AND WHO EXPLORE A SINGLE REGION OF PLEASURE AND OF PAIN.

ATTENTIVE TO THE FLUCTUATION OF THE MOMENTS, WE CANNOT ADMIT AN ABSOLUTE EVENT: JESUS CANNOT CUT HISTORY IN TWO, NOR THE RAISING OF THE CROSS BREAK THE IMPARTIAL COURSE OF TIME. RELIGIOUS THOUGHT—A FORM OF OBSESSIVE THOUGHT—SUBTRACTS A TEMPORAL PORTION FROM THE SUM OF EVENTS AND INVESTS IT WITH ALL THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE UNCONDITIONED. THIS IS HOW THE GODS AND THEIR SONS WERE POSSIBLE. . . .

LIFE IS THE SITE OF MY INFATUATIONS: EVERYTHING I WREST FROM INDIFFERENCE I GIVE BACK ALMOST AT ONCE. THIS IS NOT THE SAINTS' METHOD: THEY CHOOSE ONCE AND FOR ALL. I LIVE IN ORDER TO LEAVE OFF WHATEVER I LOVE; THEY, IN ORDER TO COMMIT THEMSELVES TO A SINGLE OBJECT; I SAVOR ETERNITY, THEY SINK THEMSELVES INTO IT.

THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH—AND A FORTIORI THOSE OF HEAVEN—RESULT FROM A DURABLE HYSTERIA. SANCTITY: EARTHQUAKE OF THE HEART, ANNIHILATION BY DINT OF BELIEF, CULMINATING EXPRESSION OF FANATIC SENSIBILITY, TRANSCENDENT DEFORMITY. . . . BETWEEN THE SAVED AND THE SIMPLE-MINDED THERE IS MORE CORRESPONDENCE THAN BETWEEN THE SAVED AND THE SKEPTIC. THAT IS THE ENTIRE DISTANCE WHICH DIVIDES FAITH FROM KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT HOPE, FROM EXISTENCE WITHOUT RESULTS.

STAGES OF PRIDE
FREQUENTING THE SAINTS' MADNESS, YOU HAPPEN TO FORGET YOUR LIMITS, YOUR CHAINS, YOUR BURDENS, AND YOU EXCLAIM: “I AM THE SOUL OF THE WORLD; I COLOR THE UNIVERSE WITH MY FLAMES. THERE WILL BE NO NIGHT FROM NOW ON: I HAVE PREPARED THE ETERNAL BANQUET OF THE STARS; THE SUN IS SUPERFLUOUS: EVERYTHING SHINES, AND THE STONES ARE LIGHTER THAN ANGELS' WINGS.”

THEN, BETWEEN FRENZY AND CONTEMPLATION: “IF I AM NOT THIS SOUL, AT LEAST I ASPIRE TO BE IT. HAVE I NOT GIVEN MY NAME TO ALL THINGS? EVERY OBJECT PROCLAIMS ME, FROM THE DUNGHEAPS TO THE VAULTS OF HEAVEN: AM I NOT THE SILENCE AND THE DIN OF THINGS?”

. . . AND, AT THE LOWEST, THE INTOXICATION PAST: “I AM THE GRAVE OF SPARKS, THE WORMS' MOCKERY, A CARRION IMPORTUNING HEAVEN, A CARNIVAL PARODY OF THE BEYOND, A CI-DEVANT NOTHING WITHOUT EVEN THE PRIVILEGE OF EVER HAVING ROTTED. WHAT PERFECTION OF THE ABYSS HAVE I COME TO, THAT THERE IS NO SPACE LEFT FOR ME TO FALL IN?”

HEAVEN AND HYGIENE
SANCTITY: SUPREME PRODUCT OF DISEASE; WHEN WE ARE WELL, IT SEEMS MONSTROUS, UNINTELLIGIBLE, AND MORBID TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE. BUT LET THAT AUTOMATIC HAMLETISM WE CALL NEUROSIS CLAIM ITS DUES AND THE HEAVENS TAKE SHAPE AND CONSTITUTE THE CONTEXT OF ANXIETY. WE PROTECT OURSELVES AGAINST SANCTITY BY TAKING CARE OF OURSELVES: IT PROCEEDS FROM A SPECIAL FILTH OF THE BODY AND OF THE SOUL. IF CHRISTIANITY HAD PROPOSED HYGIENE INSTEAD OF THE UNVERIFIABLE, WE SHOULD SEEK IN VAIN FOR A SINGLE SAINT IN ALL ITS HISTORY; BUT IT HAS CHAMPIONED OUR WOUNDS AND OUR SQUALOR, AN INTRINSIC, PHOSPHORESCENT SQUALOR. . . .

HEALTH: DECISIVE WEAPON AGAINST RELIGION INVENT THE UNIVERSAL ELIXIR: THE HEAVENS WILL VANISH AND NEVER RETURN. NO USE SEDUCING MAN BY OTHER IDEALS: THEY WILL BE WEAKER THAN DISEASES GOD IS OUR RUST, THE GRADUAL DECAY OF OUR SUBSTANCE: WHEN HE PENETRATES US, WE THINK WE ARE ELEVATED, BUT WE DESCEND LOWER AND LOWER; HAVING REACHED OUR END, HE CROWNS OUR COLLAPSE, AND SO WE ARE “SAVED” FOREVER. SINISTER SUPERSTITION, HALOED CANCER WHICH HAS EATEN AWAY THE EARTH FOR AGES. . . .

I HATE ALL GODS; I AM NOT HEALTHY ENOUGH TO SCORN THEM. THAT IS THE INDIFFERENT MAN’S GREAT HUMILIATION.

ON CERTAIN SOLITUDES
THERE ARE HEARTS GOD CANNOT LOOK INTO WITHOUT LOSING HIS INNOCENCE. SADNESS BEGAN AFTER THE CREATION: HAD THE CREATOR VENTURED FURTHER INTO THE WORLD HE WOULD HAVE COMPROMISED HIS EQUILIBRIUM. THE MAN WHO BELIEVES HE CAN STILL DIE HAS NOT KNOWN CERTAIN SOLITUDES, NOR THE INEVITABILITY OF IMMORTALITY PERCEIVED IN CERTAIN PANGS. . . .

IT IS OUR MODERN SPECIALTY TO HAVE LOCALIZED HELL IN OURSELVES: HAD WE PRESERVED ITS OLD COUNTENANCE, FEAR, SUSTAINED BY TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF THREATS, WOULD HAVE PETRIFIED US. THERE ARE NO LONGER ANY DREADS WHICH ARE NOT TRANSPOSED SUBJECTIVELY: PSYCHOLOGY IS OUR SALVATION, OUR SUBTERFUGE. IN THE OLD DAYS, THIS WORLD WAS SUPPOSED TO EMERGE FROM ONE OF THE DEVIL’S YAWNS; TODAY IT IS ONLY A MISTAKE OF THE SENSES, A PREJUDICE OF THE MIND, A VICE OF THE EMOTIONS. WE KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO WITH SAINT HILDEGARDE’S VISION OF THE LAST JUDGMENT OR SAINT TERESA’S OF HELL; THE SUBLIME—THE SUBLIME OF HORROR LIKE THAT OF HOLINESS—IS CLASSIFIED BY ANY TREATISE ON MENTAL DISEASES. AND IF OUR ILLS ARE KNOWN TO US, WE ARE NOT THEREBY EXEMPT FROM VISIONS, BUT WE NO LONGER BELIEVE IN THEM. EXPERT IN THE CHEMISTRY OF MYSTERIES, WE EXPLAIN EVERYTHING, EVEN OUR TEARS. THIS, HOWEVER, REMAINS INEXPLICABLE: IF THE SOUL IS OF SUCH LITTLE ACCOUNT, WHERE DOES THE FEELING OF OUR SOLITUDE COME FROM? WHAT SPACE DOES IT OCCUPY? AND HOW DOES IT SUDDENLY REPLACE THE HUGE VANISHED REALITY?

OSCILLATION
IN VAIN YOU SEARCH FOR YOUR MODEL AMONG HUMAN BEINGS; FROM THOSE WHO HAVE GONE FARTHER THAN YOU, YOU HAVE BORROWED ONLY THE COMPROMISING AND HARMFUL ASPECT: FROM THE SAGE, SLOTH; FROM THE SAINT, INCOHERENCE; FROM THE AESTHETE, RANCOR; FROM THE POET, PROFLIGACY—AND FROM ALL, DISAGREEMENT WITH YOURSELF, AMBIGUITY IN EVERYDAY THINGS AND HATRED FOR WHAT LIVES SIMPLY TO LIVE. PURE, YOU REGRET FILTH; SORDID, SEEMLINESS; VAGUE, VIGOR. YOU WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT WHAT YOU ARE NOT, AND THE DESPAIR OF BEING WHAT YOU ARE. WITH WHAT CONTRASTS WAS YOUR SUBSTANCE IMBUED AND WHAT MINGLED GENIUS PRESIDED OVER YOUR RELEGATION IN THE WORLD? DETERMINATION TO DIMINISH YOURSELF HAS MADE YOU ESPOUSE IN OTHERS THEIR APPETITE FOR COLLAPSE: IN THIS MUSICIAN, THIS DISEASE; IN THIS PROPHET, THIS DEFECT; AND IN WOMEN—POETS, LIBERTINES, OR SAINTS—THEIR MELANCHOLY, THEIR VITIATED SPIRITS, THEIR CORRUPTION OF FLESH AND BLOOD AND DREAMS. BITTERNESS, PRINCIPLE OF YOUR DETERMINATION, YOUR MODE OF ACTION, AND UNDERSTANDING, IS THE ONE FIXED POINT IN YOUR OSCILLATION BETWEEN DISGUST FOR THE WORLD AND SELF-PITY.

THREAT OF SANCTITY
ABLE TO LIVE ONLY BEYOND OR SHORT OF LIFE, MAN IS A PREY TO TWO TEMPTATIONS: IMBECILITY AND SANCTITY: SUB-MAN AND SUPERMAN, NEVER HIMSELF. BUT WHEREAS HE DOES NOT SUFFER FROM THE FEAR OF BEING LESS THAN WHAT HE IS, THE PROSPECT OF BEING MORE TERRIFIES HIM. COMMITTED TO PAIN, HE DREADS ITS CONCLUSION: HOW COULD HE CONSENT TO FOUNDER IN THAT ABYSS OF PERFECTION WHICH IS SANCTITY, AND THERE LOSE HIS OWN CONTROL? TO SLIDE TOWARD IMBECILITY OR TOWARD SANCTITY IS TO LET YOURSELF BE LURED OUTSIDE YOURSELF. YET WE ARE NOT ALARMED BY THE LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS IMPLIED BY THE APPROACH OF IDIOCY, WHILE THE PROSPECT OF PERFECTION IS INSEPARABLE FROM VERTIGO. IT IS BY IMPERFECTION THAT WE ARE SUPERIOR TO GOD; AND IT IS THE FEAR OF LOSING IT WHICH MAKES US FLEE SANCTITY! THE TERROR OF A FUTURE IN WHICH WE SHALL NO LONGER BE IN DESPAIR .. . IN WHICH, AT THE TERM OF OUR DISASTERS, ANOTHER, UNLONGED FOR, WOULD APPEAR—DIE TERROR OF SALVATION, THE TERROR OF BECOMING SAINTS. . . .

THE MAN WHO ADORES HIS IMPERFECTIONS IS FRIGHTENED OF A TRANSFIGURATION WHICH HIS SUFFERINGS MIGHT PREPARE FOR HIM. TO VANISH IN A TRANSCENDENT LIGHT. . . . BETTER THEN TO MAKE FOR THE ABSOLUTE OF DARKNESS, TOWARD THE COMFORTS OF IMBECILITY. . . .

THE TILTING CROSS
SUBLIME HODGEPODGE, CHRISTIANITY IS TOO PROFOUND-—AND ABOVE ALL, TOO IMPURE—TO LAST ANY LONGER: ITS CENTURIES ARE NUMBERED. JESUS FADES, FROM DAY TO DAY; HIS PRECEPTS, LIKE HIS MILDNESS, VEX; HIS MIRACLES AND HIS DIVINITY MAKE US SMILE. THE CROSS TILTS: THE SYMBOL IS TURNING BACK INTO SUBSTANCE . . . BACK INTO THE ORDER OF THAT DECOMPOSITION IN WHICH, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, HONORABLE AND UNWORTHY THINGS DIE. TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF SUCCESS! A FABULOUS RESIGNATION ON THE PART OF THE MOST FRETFUL ANIMAL OF ALL . . . BUT OUR PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED. THE NOTION THAT I COULD—LIKE EVERYONE ELSE—BE SINCERELY CHRISTIAN, IF ONLY A SECOND, CASTS ME INTO PERPLEXITY. THE SAVIOR BORES ME. I DREAM OF A UNIVERSE EXEMPT FROM CELESTIAL INTOXICATIONS, OF A UNIVERSE WITH NEITHER CROSS NOR FAITH.

WHO CAN FAIL TO SEE THE MOMENT COMING WHEN THERE WILL BE NO MORE RELIGION, WHEN MAN, LUCID AND EMPTY, WILL HAVE NO WORD ON HAND TO DESIGNATE HIS ABYSS? THE UNKNOWN WILL BE AS DULL AS THE KNOWN; EVERYTHING WILL LACK INTEREST AND FLAVOR. ON THE RUINS OF KNOWLEDGE, A SEPULCHRAL LETHARGY WILL MAKE US ALL INTO SPECTERS, LUNAR HEROES OF INCURIOSITY. . . .

THEOLOGY
I AM IN A GOOD MOOD: GOD IS GOOD; I AM SULLEN: GOD IS WICKED; I AM INDIFFERENT: HE IS NEUTRAL. MY STATES CONFER UPON HIM CORRESPONDING ATTRIBUTES: WHEN I LOVE KNOWLEDGE, HE IS OMNISCIENT, AND WHEN I WORSHIP POWER, OMNIPOTENT. WHEN THINGS SEEM TO ME TO EXIST, HE EXISTS; WHEN THEY SEEM ILLUSORY, HE EVAPORATES. A THOUSAND ARGUMENTS SUSTAIN HIM, AND A THOUSAND DESTROY; IF MY ENTHUSIASMS ANIMATE HIM, MY SULKS SMOTHER HIM. WE CANNOT FORM A MORE VARIABLE IMAGE: WE FEAR HIM AS A MONSTER AND CRUSH HIM LIKE A WORM; WE IDOLIZE HIM: HE IS BEING; REPEL HIM: HE IS NOTHINGNESS. WERE PRAYER TO SUPPLANT GRAVITY, IT WOULD SCARCELY ASSURE HIS UNIVERSAL DURATION: HE WOULD STILL REMAIN AT THE MERCY OF OUR MOMENTS. HIS FATE HAS DECIDED THAT HE BE UNCHANGEABLE ONLY IN THE EYES OF THE NAIVE OR THE RETARDED. SCRUTINY REVEALS HIM: USELESS CAUSE, MEANINGLESS ABSOLUTE, PATRON OF DOLTS, PASTIME OF SOLITARIES, STRAW OR SPECTER ACCORDING TO WHETHER HE AMUSES OUR MIND OR HAUNTS OUR FEVERS.

    I AM GENEROUS: HE SWELLS WITH ATTRIBUTES; SOUR: HE IS HEAVY WITH ABSENCE. I HAVE EXPERIENCED HIM IN ALL HIS FORMS. HE RESISTS NEITHER CURIOSITY NOR INSPECTION: HIS MYSTERY, HIS INFINITY DECLINES; HIS LUSTER DIMS; HIS PRESTIGE DIMINISHES. HE IS A WORN COSTUME WE MUST STRIP OFF; HOW STILL DRAPE OURSELVES IN A TATTERED GOD? HIS DEGRADATION, HIS AGONY DRAG ON THROUGH THE AGES; BUT HE WILL NOT OUTLIVE US, HE IS AGING: HIS LAST GASPS WILL PRECEDE OURS. ONCE HIS ATTRIBUTES ARE EXHAUSTED, NO ONE WILL HAVE THE ENERGY TO FORGE HIM NEW ONES; AND THE CREATURE HAVING ASSUMED, THEN REJECTED, THEM WILL GO AND REJOIN, IN NOTHINGNESS, MS LOFTIEST INVENTION: HIS CREATOR.

THE METAPHYSICAL ANIMAL
IF WE COULD ELIMINATE EVERYTHING NEUROSIS HAS INSCRIBED IN THE MIND AND THE HEART, ALL THE MORBID MARKS IT HAS LEFT THERE, ALL THE IMPURE SHADOWS ACCOMPANYING IT! WHAT IS NOT SUPERFICIAL IS UNCLEAN. GOD: FRUIT OF THE ANXIETY OF OUR GUTS AND THE GURGLE OF OUR IDEAS. . . . ONLY ASPIRATION TO THE VOID SAVES US FROM THAT EXERCISE OF CORRUPTION WHICH IS THE ACT OF BELIEF. WHAT LIMPIDITY IN THE ART OF APPEARANCE, IN THE INDIFFERENCE TO OUR ENDS AND OUR DISASTERS! TO THINK OF GOD, TO SEEK HIM, TO INVOKE OR TO ENDURE HIM—MOVEMENTS OF A DISORDERED BODY AND A DEFEATED MIND! THE NOBLY SUPERFICIAL AGES—THE RENAISSANCE, THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY—SCORNED RELIGION, DISMISSED ITS RUDIMENTARY FROLICS. BUT ALAS! THERE IS A PLEBEIAN MELANCHOLY IN US WHICH DARKENS OUR FERVORS AND OUR CONCEPTS. VAINLY WE DREAM OF A LACE UNIVERSE; GOD, PRODUCT OF OUR DEPTHS, OUR GANGRENE, PROFANES THIS DREAM OF BEAUTY.

WE ARE METAPHYSICAL ANIMALS BY THE CORRUPTION WE HARBOR IN OURSELVES. HISTORY OF THOUGHT—PROCESSION OF OUR LAPSES; LIFE OF THE MIND—PARADE OF OUR VERTIGO. WHEN OUR HEALTH DECLINES, THE UNIVERSE SUFFERS FOR IT AND MUST FOLLOW THE DESCENDING CURVE OF OUR VITALITY.

ENDLESSLY HARPING ON THE “WHY” AND THE “HOW"; TRACING THE CAUSE, AND ALL CAUSES, ON THE SLIGHTEST PRETEXT—DENOTES A DISORDER OF THE FUNCTIONS AND FACULTIES WHICH ENDS IN A “METAPHYSICAL DELIRIUM” —SENILITY OF THE ABYSS, DOWNFALL OF ANGUISH, ULTIMATE UGLINESS OF THE MYSTERIES. .. .

GENESIS OF MELANCHOLY
EVERY PROFOUND DISSATISFACTION IS OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE: OUR FAILURES DERIVE FROM OUR INCAPACITY TO CONCEIVE OF PARADISE AND TO ASPIRE TO IT, AS OUR DISCOMFORTS FROM THE FRAGILITY OF OUR RELATIONS WITH THE ABSOLUTE. “I AM AN INCOMPLETE RELIGIOUS ANIMAL, I SUFFER ALL ILLS DOUBLY"—AN ADAGE OF THE FALL WHICH MAN KEEPS REPEATING TO COMFORT HIMSELF. FAILING TO DO SO, HE APPEALS TO ETHICS, DECIDES TO FOLLOW, AT THE RISK OF RIDICULE, EDIFYING ADVICE: “RESOLVE TO BE MELANCHOLY NO LONGER,” ETHICS REPLIES. AND MAN STRIVES TO ENTER THE UNIVERSE OF GOOD, OF WELL-BEING, OF HOPE. . . . BUT HIS EFFORTS ARE INEFFECTUAL AND AGAINST NATURE: MELANCHOLY HARKS BACK TO THE ROOT OF OUR RUIN . . . MELANCHOLY IS THE POETRY OF ORIGINAL SIN. . . .

DIVAGATIONS IN A MONASTERY
FOR THE UNBELIEVER, INFATUATED WITH WASTE AND DISPERSION, THERE IS NO SPECTACLE MORE DISTURBING THAN THESE RUMINANTS OF THE ABSOLUTE. . . . WHERE DO THEY FIND SUCH PERTINACITY IN THE UNVERIFIABLE, SO MUCH ATTENTION IN THE VAGUE, AND SO MUCH ARDOR TO APPREHEND IT AS WELL? I SHARE NEITHER THEIR CERTITUDES NOR THEIR SERENITY. THEY ARE HAPPY, AND I BLAME THEM FOR BEING SO. IF AT LEAST THEY HATED THEMSELVES! BUT THEY PRIZE THEIR “SOUL” MORE THAN THE UNIVERSE; THIS FALSE EVALUATION IS THE SOURCE OF SACRIFICES AND RENUNCIATIONS OF AN IMPOSING ABSURDITY WHEREAS OUR EXPERIENCES HAVE NEITHER SEQUENCE NOR SYSTEM, BEING AT THE MERCY OF CHANCE AND OUR MOODS, THEY HAVE BUT ONE EXPERIENCE, ALWAYS THE SAME, OF A MONOTONY AND A PROFUNDITY WHICH ARE PROFOUNDLY DISHEARTENING. IT IS TRUE THAT GOD IS ITS OBJECT; BUT WHAT INTEREST CAN THEY STILL TAKE IN HIM? ALWAYS EQUAL TO HIMSELF, INFINITELY OF THE SAME NATURE, HE NEVER RENEWS HIMSELF; I COULD REFLECT UPON HIM IN PASSING, BUT TO FILL THE HOURS WITH HIM! . . .

IT IS NOT YET DAYLIGHT. FROM MY CELL, I HEAR VOICES, AND THE AGE-OLD REFRAINS, OFFERINGS TO A BANAL LATIN HEAVEN. EARLIER IN THE NIGHT, STEPS HASTENED TOWARD THE CHAPEL. MATINS! EVEN IF GOD HIMSELF WERE TO ATTEND HIS OWN CELEBRATION I WOULD NOT GET OUT OF BED ON A NIGHT THIS COLD! BUT IN ANY CASE HE HAS TO EXIST, OTHERWISE THESE SACRIFICES OF CREATURES OF FLESH, SHAKING OFF THEIR SLOTH TO WORSHIP HIM, WOULD BE OF SUCH INSANITY THAT REASON COULD NOT ENDURE THE THOUGHT. THE PROOFS OF THEOLOGY ARE FUTILE COMPARED TO THIS EXERTION WHICH PERPLEXES THE UNBELIEVER AND OBLIGES HIM TO ATTRIBUTE A MEANING AND A USE TO SUCH EFFORTS. UNLESS HE RESIGNS HIMSELF TO AN AESTHETIC PERSPECTIVE OF THESE DELIBERATE INSOMNIAS, AND IN THE VANITY OF THESE VIGILS SEES MERELY THE MOST GIGANTIC ADVENTURE, THE QUEST OF A BEAUTY OF NON-MEANING AND DREAD. . . . THE SPLENDOR OF A PRAYER ADDRESSED TO NO ONE! BUT SOMETHING HAS TO BE: WHEN THIS PROBABLE CHANGES INTO CERTITUDE, FELICITY IS NO LONGER A MERE WORD, SO TRUE IS IT THAT THE ONLY ANSWER TO NOTHINGNESS LIES IN ILLUSION. HOW HAVE THEY ACQUIRED THIS ILLUSION, LABELED, ON THE ABSOLUTE LEVEL, GRACE? BY WHAT PRIVILEGE WERE THEY LED TO HOPE WHAT NO HOPE IN THIS WORLD LETS US GLIMPSE? BY WHAT RIGHT DO THEY INSTALL THEMSELVES IN AN ETERNITY WHICH EVERYTHING DENIES US? BY WHAT SUBTERFUGE DO THESE POSSESSORS—THE ONLY TRUE POSSESSORS I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED—ARROGATE THE MYSTERY TO THEMSELVES IN ORDER TO DELIGHT IN IT THEREBY? GOD BELONGS TO THEM; TO ATTEMPT TO SNEAK HIM AWAY WOULD BE FUTILE; THEY THEMSELVES KNOW NOTHING OF THE METHOD BY WHICH THEY HAVE TAKEN POSSESSION. ONE FINE DAY . . . THEY BELIEVED. THIS ONE WAS CONVERTED BY A SIMPLE APPEAL: HE BELIEVED WITHOUT BEING CONSCIOUS OF IT; WHEN HE WAS, HE ASSUMED THE HABIT. THAT ONE SUFFERED EVERY TORMENT: THEY CEASED BEFORE A SUDDEN LIGHT. ONE CANNOT WILL FAITH; LIKE A DISEASE, IT INSINUATES ITSELF IN YOU OR STRIKES YOU DOWN; NO ONE CAN COMMAND IT; AND IT IS ABSURD TO LONG FOR IT IF YOU ARE NOT PREDESTINED TO IT. YOU ARE A BELIEVER OR YOU ARE NOT, THE WAY YOU ARE CRAZY OR NORMAL I CAN NEITHER BELIEVE NOR WANT TO BELIEVE-—FAITH, A FORM OF MADNESS TO WHICH I AM NOT AT ALL SUBJECT, . . . THE UNBELIEVER’S POSITION IS QUITE AS IMPENETRABLE AS THE BELIEVER’S. I DEVOTE MYSELF TO THE PLEASURE OF BEING DISAPPOINTED: THIS IS THE VERY ESSENCE OF THE WORLD; ABOVE DOUBT, I RANK ONLY THE DELIGHT WHICH DERIVES FROM IT. . . .

AND I ANSWER ALL THESE PINK OR CHLOROTIC MONKS: “YOU INSIST TO NO PURPOSE. I TOO HAVE GAZED UPON THE HEAVENS, BUT I HAVE SEEN NOTHING THERE. GIVE UP TRYING TO CONVINCE ME: IF I HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN ABLE TO FIND GOD BY DEDUCTION, I HAVE NEVER FOUND HIM IN MY HEART; IF I FOUND HIM THERE, I COULD NOT FOLLOW YOU ON YOUR PATH OR IN YOUR GRIMACES, STILL LESS IN THOSE BALLETS WHICH ARE YOUR MASSES AND COMPLINES. NOTHING SURPASSES THE PLEASURES OF IDLENESS: IF THE END OF THE WORLD WERE TO COME, I WOULD NOT LEAVE MY BED AT AN UNGODLY HOUR, SO HOW WOULD I GO RUNNING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO IMMOLATE MY SLEEP ON THE ALTAR OF THE UNCERTAIN? EVEN IF GRACE BECLOUDED ME AND ECSTASIES MADE ME QUIVER UNCEASINGLY, A FEW SARCASMS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO DISTRACT ME. OH NO, YOU SEE, I WOULD BE AFRAID TO SNEAR IN MY PRAYERS AND THEREBY TO DAMN MYSELF MUCH MORE BY FAITH THAN BY INCREDULITY. SPARE ME ANY FURTHER EFFORT; IN ANY CASE, MY SHOULDERS ARE TOO WEARY TO PROP HEAVEN. . . .”

EXERCISE OF INSUBMISSION
HOW I DETEST, LORD, THE TURPITUDE OF YOUR WORKS AND THESE SYRUPY GHOSTS WHO BURN INCENSE TO YOU AND RESEMBLE YOU! HATING YOU, I HAVE ESCAPED THE SUGAR MILLS OF YOUR KINGDOM, THE TWADDLE OF YOUR PUPPETS. YOU ARE THE DAMPER OF OUR FLAMES AND OUR REBELLIONS, THE FIRE HOSE OF OUR FEVERS, THE SUPERINTENDENT OF OUR SENILITIES. EVEN BEFORE RELEGATING YOU TO A FORMULA, I TRAMPLED YOUR ARCANA, SCORNED YOUR TRICKS AND ALL THOSE ARTIFICES WHICH PRODUCE YOUR TOILETTE OF THE INEXPLICABLE. YOU HAVE GENEROUSLY ENDOWED ME WITH THE GALL YOUR PITY SPARED YOUR SLAVES. SINCE THERE IS NO REST BUT IN THE SHADOW OF YOUR NULLITY, THE BRUTE FINDS SALVATION BY JUST HANDING HIMSELF OVER TO YOU OR YOUR COUNTERFEITS. I DON’T KNOW WHICH IS MORE PITIABLE, YOUR ACOLYTES OR MYSELF: WE ALL DERIVE STRAIGHT FROM YOUR INCOMPETENCE: PITCH, PATCH, HODGEPODGE—SYLLABLES OF THE CREATION, OF YOUR BLUNDERING. . . .

OF ALL THAT WAS ATTEMPTED THIS SIDE OF NOTHINGNESS, IS ANYTHING MORE PATHETIC THAN THIS WORLD, EXCEPT FOR THE IDEA WHICH CONCEIVED IT? WHEREVER SOMETHING BREATHES THERE IS ONE MORE INFIRMITY: NO PALPITATION WHICH FAILS TO CONFIRM THE DISADVANTAGE OF BEING; THE FLESH HORRIFIES ME: THESE MEN, THESE WOMEN, OFFAL THAT MOANS BY THE GRACE OF CERTAIN SPASMS; NO MORE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PLANET: EACH MOMENT IS MERELY A VOTE IN THE URN OF MY DESPAIR.

WHAT DOES IT MATTER, WHETHER YOUR WORKS LEAVE OFF OR CONTINUE! YOUR SUBALTERNS CANNOT COMPLETE WHAT YOU VENTURED WITHOUT GENIUS. FROM THE BLINDNESS INTO WHICH YOU PLUNGED THEM, THEY WILL EMERGE NONETHELESS, BUT WILL THEY HAVE THE STRENGTH TO TAKE REVENGE, AND WILL YOU TO DEFEND YOURSELF? THIS RACE IS RUSTY, AND YOU EVEN RUSTIER. TURNING TOWARD YOUR ENEMY, I AWAIT THE DAY WHEN HE WILL PILFER YOUR SUN TO HANG IT IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE.

THE DECOR OF KNOWLEDGE
OUR TRUTHS ARE WORTH NO MORE THAN THOSE OF OUR ANCESTORS. HAVING SUBSTITUTED CONCEPTS FOR THEIR MYTHS AND SYMBOLS, WE CONSIDER OURSELVES “ADVANCED"; BUT THESE MYTHS AND SYMBOLS EXPRESSED NO LESS THAN OUR CONCEPTS. THE TREE OF LIFE, THE SERPENT, EVE, AND PARADISE SIGNIFY AS MUCH AS LIFE, KNOWLEDGE, TEMPTATION, UNCONSCIOUSNESS. THE CONCRETE FIGURATIONS OF GOOD AND EVIL IN MYTHOLOGY GO AS FAR AS THE GOOD AND EVIL OF ETHICS. KNOWLEDGE—IF IT IS PROFOUND—NEVER CHANGES: ONLY ITS DECOR VARIES. LOVE CONTINUES WITHOUT VENUS, WAR WITHOUT MARS, AND IF THE GODS NO LONGER INTERVENE IN EVENTS, THOSE EVENTS ARE NEITHER MORE EXPLICABLE NOR LESS DISCONCERTING: THE PARAPHERNALIA OF FORMULAS MERELY REPLACES THE POMP OF THE OLD LEGENDS, WITHOUT THE CONSTANTS OF HUMAN LIFE BEING THEREBY MODIFIED, SCIENCE APPREHENDING THEM NO MORE INTIMATELY THAN POETIC NARRATIVES.

MODERN COMPLACENCY IS LIMITLESS: WE SUPPOSE OURSELVES MORE ENLIGHTENED, MORE PROFOUND THAN ALL THE CENTURIES BEHIND US, FORGETTING THAT THE TEACHING OF A BUDDHA CONFRONTED THOUSANDS OF BEINGS WITH THE PROBLEM OF NOTHINGNESS, A PROBLEM WE IMAGINE WE HAVE DISCOVERED BECAUSE WE HAVE CHANGED ITS TERMS AND INTRODUCED A TOUCH OF ERUDITION INTO IT. BUT WHAT WESTERN THINKER WOULD SURVIVE A COMPARISON WITH A BUDDHIST MONK? WE LOSE OURSELVES IN TEXTS AND TERMINOLOGIES: MEDITATION IS A DATUM UNKNOWN TO MODERN PHILOSOPHY. IF WE WANT TO KEEP SOME INTELLECTUAL DECENCY, ENTHUSIASM FOR CIVILIZATION MUST BE BANISHED FROM OUR MIND, AS WELL AS THE SUPERSTITION OF HISTORY. AS FOR THE GREAT PROBLEMS, WE HAVE NO ADVANTAGE OVER OUR ANCESTORS OR OUR MORE RECENT PREDECESSORS: MEN HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN EVERYTHING, AT LEAST IN WHAT CONCERNS THE ESSENTIAL; MODERN PHILOSOPHY ADDS NOTHING TO CHINESE, HINDU, OR GREEK PHILOSOPHY. MOREOVER, THERE CANNOT BE A NEW PROBLEM, DESPITE OUR NAÏVETE OR OUR INFATUATION WHICH WOULD LIKE TO PERSUADE US TO THE CONTRARY. IN THE PLAY OF IDEAS, WHO EVER EQUALED A CHINESE OR A GREEK SOPHIST, WHO WAS EVER BOLDER IN ABSTRACTION? ALL THE EXTREMITIES OF THOUGHT WERE REACHED FROM THE FIRST—AND IN ALL CIVILIZATIONS. SEDUCED BY THE DEMON OF THE UNPUBLISHED, WE FORGET TOO QUICKLY THAT WE ARE THE EPIGONES OF THE FIRST PITHECANTHROPUS WHO BOTHERED TO REFLECT.

HEGEL IS CHIEFLY RESPONSIBLE FOR MODERN OPTIMISM. HOW COULD HE HAVE FAILED TO SEE THAT CONSCIOUSNESS CHANGES ONLY ITS FORMS AND MODALITIES, BUT NEVER PROGRESSES? BECOMING EXCLUDES AN ABSOLUTE FULFILLMENT, A GOAL: THE TEMPORAL ADVENTURE UNFOLDS WITHOUT AN AIM EXTERNAL TO ITSELF, AND WILL END WHEN ITS POSSIBILITIES OF MOVEMENT ARE EXHAUSTED. THE DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS VARIES WITH THE AGES, SUCH CONSCIOUSNESS NOT BEING AGGRANDIZED BY THEIR SUCCESSION. WE ARE NOT MORE CONSCIOUS THAN THE GRECO-ROMAN WORLD, THE RENAISSANCE, OR THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY; EACH PERIOD IS PERFECT IN ITSELF—AND PERISHABLE. THERE ARE PRIVILEGED MOMENTS WHEN CONSCIOUSNESS IS EXASPERATED, BUT THERE WAS NEVER AN ECLIPSE OF LUCIDITY SUCH THAT MAN WAS INCAPABLE OF CONFRONTING THE ESSENTIAL PROBLEMS, HISTORY BEING NO MORE THAN A PERPETUAL CRISIS, EVEN A BREAKDOWN OF NAÏVETE. NEGATIVE STATES—PRECISELY THOSE WHICH EXASPERATE CONSCIOUSNESS—ARE VARIOUSLY DISTRIBUTED; NONETHELESS THEY ARE PRESENT IN EVERY HISTORICAL PERIOD; BALANCED AND “HAPPY,” THEY KNOW ENNUI—THE NATURAL NAME FOR HAPPINESS; UNBALANCED AND TUMULTUOUS, THEY SUFFER DESPAIR AND THE RELIGIOUS CRISES WHICH DERIVE FROM IT. THE IDEA OF AN EARTHLY PARADISE WAS COMPOSED OF ALL THE ELEMENTS INCOMPATIBLE WITH HISTORY, WITH THE SPACE IN WHICH THE NEGATIVE STATES FLOURISH.

ALL MEANS AND METHODS OF KNOWING ARE VALID: REASONING, INTUITION, DISGUST, ENTHUSIASM, LAMENTATION. A VISION OF THE WORLD PROPPED ON CONCEPTS IS NO MORE LEGITIMATE THAN ANOTHER WHICH PROCEEDS FROM TEARS, ARGUMENTS, OR SIGHS—MODALITIES EQUALLY PROBING AND EQUALLY VAIN. I CONSTRUCT A FORM OF UNIVERSE; I BELIEVE IN IT, AND IT IS THE UNIVERSE, WHICH COLLAPSES NONETHELESS UNDER THE ASSAULT OF ANOTHER CERTITUDE OR ANOTHER DOUBT. THE MEREST ILLITERATE AND ARISTOTLE ARE EQUALLY IRREFUTABLE—AND FRAGILE. THE ABSOLUTE AND DECREPITUDE CHARACTERIZE THE WORK RIPENED FOR YEARS AND THE POEM DASHED OFF IN A MOMENT. IS THERE MORE TRUTH IN THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND THAN IN EPIPSYCHIDION? LIGHTNINGLIKE INSPIRATION, AS WELL AS LABORIOUS INVESTIGATION, OFFERS US DEFINITIVE RESULTS—AND RIDICULOUS ONES. TODAY I PREFER THIS WRITER TO THAT ONE; TOMORROW WILL COME THE TURN OF A WORK I DETESTED QUITE RECENTLY. THE CREATIONS OF THE MIND—AND THE PRINCIPLES WHICH PRESIDE OVER THEM—FOLLOW THE FATE OF OUR MOODS, OF OUR AGE, OF OUR FEVERS, AND OUR DISAPPOINTMENTS. WE CALL INTO QUESTION EVERYTHING WE ONCE LOVED, AND ARE ALWAYS RIGHT AND ALWAYS WRONG; FOR EVERYTHING IS VALID—AND NOTHING HAS ANY IMPORTANCE. I SMILE: A WORLD IS BORN; I FROWN: IT VANISHES, AND ANOTHER APPEARS. NO OPINION, NO SYSTEM, NO BELIEF FAILS TO BE CORRECT AND AT THE SAME TIME ABSURD, DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE ADHERE TO IT OR DETACH OURSELVES FROM IT.

WE DO NOT FIND MORE RIGOR IN PHILOSOPHY THAN IN POETRY, NOR IN THE MIND THAN IN THE HEART; RIGOR EXISTS ONLY SO LONG AS WE IDENTIFY OURSELF WITH THE PRINCIPLE OR THING WHICH WE CONFRONT OR ENDURE; FROM OUTSIDE, EVERYTHING IS ARBITRARY: REASONS AND SENTIMENTS. WHAT WE CALL TRUTH IS AN ERROR INSUFFICIENTLY EXPERIENCED, NOT YET DRAINED, BUT WHICH WILL SOON AGE, A NEW ERROR, AND WHICH WAITS TO COMPROMISE ITS NOVELTY. KNOWLEDGE BLOOMS AND WITHERS ALONG WITH OUR FEELINGS. AND IF WE ARE IN A POSITION TO SCRUTINIZE ALL TRUTHS, IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED TOGETHER—AND BECAUSE THERE IS NO MORE SAP IN US THAN IN THEM. HISTORY IS INCONCEIVABLE OUTSIDE OF WHAT DISAPPOINTS. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE DESIRE TO SUBMIT OURSELVES TO MELANCHOLY, AND TO DIE OF IT. . . .

TRUE KNOWLEDGE COMES DOWN TO VIGILS IN THE DARKNESS: THE SUM OF OUR INSOMNIAS ALONE DISTINGUISHES US FROM THE ANIMALS AND FROM OUR KIND. WHAT RICH OR STRANGE IDEA WAS EVER THE WORK OF A SLEEPER? IS YOUR SLEEP SOUND? ARE YOUR DREAMS SWEET? YOU SWELL THE ANONYMOUS CROWD. DAYLIGHT IS HOSTILE TO THOUGHTS, THE SUN BLOCKS THEM OUT; THEY FLOURISH ONLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. . . . CONCLUSION OF NOCTURNAL KNOWLEDGE: EVERY MAN WHO ARRIVES AT A REASSURING CONCLUSION ABOUT ANYTHING AT ALL GIVES EVIDENCE OF IMBECILITY OR FALSE CHARITY. WHO EVER FOUND A SINGLE JOYOUS TRUTH WHICH WAS VALID? WHO SAVED THE HONOR OF THE INTELLECT WITH DAYLIGHT UTTERANCES? HAPPY THE MAN WHO CAN SAY TO HIMSELF: “KNOWLEDGE TURNED SOUR ON ME.”

HISTORY IS IRONY ON THE MOVE, THE MIND’S JEER DOWN THROUGH MEN AND EVENTS. TODAY THIS BELIEF TRIUMPHS; TOMORROW, VANQUISHED, IT WILL BE DISMISSED AND REPLACED: THOSE WHO ACCEPTED IT WILL FOLLOW IT IN ITS DEFEAT THEN COMES ANOTHER GENERATION: THE OLD BELIEF IS REVIVED; ITS DEMOLISHED MONUMENTS ARE RECONSTRUCTED . . . UNTIL THEY PERISH YET AGAIN. NO IMMUTABLE PRINCIPLE RULES THE FAVORS AND SEVERITIES OF FATE: THEIR SUCCESSION PARTICIPATES IN THE HUGE FARCE OF THE MIND, WHICH IDENTIFIES, IN ITS PLAY, IMPOSTORS AND ENTHUSIASTS, ARDORS AND DEVICES. CONSIDER THE POLEMICS OF EACH AGE: THEY SEEM NEITHER MOTIVATED NOR NECESSARY. YET THEY WERE THE VERY LIFE OF THAT AGE, CALVINISM, QUIETISM, PORT-ROYAL, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA, THE REVOLUTION, POSITIVISM, ETC. . . . WHAT A SERIES OF ABSURDITIES . . . WHICH/TAI TO BE, WHAT A FUTILE AND YET FATAL EXPENSE! FROM THE ECUMENICAL COUNCILS TO THE CONTROVERSIES OF CONTEMPORARY POLITICS, ORTHODOXIES AND HERESIES HAVE ASSAILED THE CURIOSITY OF MANKIND WITH THEIR IRRESISTIBLE NON-MEANING. UNDER VARIOUS DISGUISES THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PRO AND CON, WHETHER APROPOS OF HEAVEN OR THE BORDELLO. THOUSANDS OF MEN WILL SUFFER FOR SUBTLETIES RELATING TO THE VIRGIN AND THE SON; THOUSANDS OF OTHERS WILL TORMENT THEMSELVES FOR DOGMAS LESS GRATUITOUS BUT QUITE AS IMPROBABLE. ALL TRUTHS CONSTITUTE SECTS WHICH END BY ENDURING THE DESTINY OF A PORT-ROYAL, BY BEING PERSECUTED AND DESTROYED; THEN, THEIR RUINS, BELOVED NOW AND EMBELLISHED WITH THE HALO OF THE INIQUITY INFLICTED UPON THEM, WILL BE TRANSFORMED INTO A PILGRIMAGE-SITE. . . .

IT IS NO LESS UNREASONABLE TO GRANT MORE INTEREST TO THE ARGUMENTS AROUND DEMOCRACY AND ITS FORMS THAN TO THOSE WHICH TOOK PLACE, IN THE MIDDLE AGES, AROUND NOMINALISM AND REALISM: EACH PERIOD IS INTOXICATED BY AN ABSOLUTE, MINOR AND TIRESOME, BUT IN APPEARANCE UNIQUE; WE CANNOT AVOID BEING CONTEMPORARIES OF A FAITH, OF A SYSTEM, OF AN IDEOLOGY, CANNOT AVOID BEING, IN SHORT, OF OUR TIME. IN ORDER TO BE EMANCIPATED FROM THAT, WE WOULD REQUIRE THE COLDNESS OF A GOD OF SCORN. . . .

THAT HISTORY HAS NO MEANING IS WHAT SHOULD DELIGHT OUR HEARTS. SHOULD WE BE TORMENTING OURSELVES FOR A HAPPY SOLUTION TO PROCESS, FOR A FINAL FESTIVAL PAID FOR BY NOTHING BUT OUR SWEAT, OUR DISASTERS? FOR FUTURE IDIOTS EXULTING OVER OUR LABORS, FROLICKING ON OUR ASHES? THE VISION OF A PARADISIAC CONCLUSION TRANSCENDS, IN ITS ABSURDITY, THE WORST DIVAGATIONS OF HOPE. ALL WE CAN OFFER IN EXCUSE FOR TIME IS THAT IN IT WE FIND SOME MOMENTS MORE PROFITABLE THAN OTHERS, ACCIDENTS WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE IN AN INTOLERABLE MONOTONY OF PERPLEXITIES. THE UNIVERSE BEGINS AND ENDS WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL, WHETHER HE BE SHAKESPEARE OR HODGE; FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCES HIS MERIT OR HIS NULLITY IN THE ABSOLUTE. . . .

BY WHAT ARTIFICE DID WHAT SEEMS TO BE ESCAPE THE CONTROL OF WHAT IS NOT? A MOMENT OF INATTENTION, OF WEAKNESS AT THE HEART OF NOTHINGNESS: THE GRABS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT; A GAP IN ITS VIGILANCE: AND HERE WE ARE. AND JUST AS LIFE SUPPLANTED NOTHINGNESS, LIFE IN ITS TURN WAS SUPPLANTED BY HISTORY: EXISTENCE THEREBY COMMITTED ITSELF TO A CYCLE OF HERESIES WHICH SAPPED THE ORTHODOXY OF THE VOID.

ABDICATIONS
THE ROPE—UNDERSIDE OF AN OBSESSION—EPITAPH—SECULARIZATION OF TEARS—FLUCTUATIONS OF THE WILL—THEORY OF GOODNESS—MAKING ALLOWANCES—WONDERS OF VICE—THE CORRUPTER—THE ARCHITECT OF THE CAVES—DISCIPLINE OF ATONY—SUPREME EROSION—AT THE OBSEQUIES OF DESIRE—IRREFUTABLE DISAPPOINTMENT—IN THE SECRET OF MORALISTS—MONASTIC FANTASY—IN HONOR OF MADNESS—MY HEROES—THE SIMPLE-MINDED—POVERTY: MENTAL STIMULANT—INVOCATION TO INSOMNIA—PROFILE OF THE WICKED MAN—VIEWS ON TOLERANCE—SARTORIAL PHILOSOPHY—AMONG THE DREGS—ON AN ENTREPRENEUR OF IDEAS—TRUTHS OF TEMPERAMENT—FLAYED ALIVE—INCOMPATIBILITIES—RESTORATION OF A CULT—WE TROGLODYTES— PHYSIOGNOMY OF A FAILURE—PROCESSION OF SUB-MEN—QUOUSQUE EADEM?

I NO LONGER REMEMBER HOW I HAPPENED TO BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF THIS CONFIDENCE: “POSSESSING NOT PROPERTY, PROJECTS, OR EVEN MEMORIES, I HAVE GIVEN OVER FUTURE AND PHILOSOPHY ALIKE, OWNING MERELY A COT ON WHICH TO UNLEARN THE SUN AND SIGHS. I REMAIN STRETCHED OUT THERE, AND SPIN OUT THE HOURS; AROUND ME, UTENSILS, OBJECTS WHICH SUGGEST SUICIDE, EVERY ONE. THE NAIL WHISPERS: STICK ME THROUGH YOUR HEART, THE TRICKLE OF BLOOD NEED NOT ALARM YOU. THE KNIFE INSINUATES: MY BLADE IS INFALLIBLE; ONE SECOND’S DECISION AND YOU HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER MISERY AND SHAME. THE WINDOW OPENS OF ITS OWN ACCORD, CREAKING IN THE SILENCE: YOU SHARE THE CITY’S HEIGHTS WITH THE POOR; FLING YOURSELF OUT, MY OVERTURE IS A GENEROUS ONE; IN THE WINK OF AN EYE, YOU WILL LAND ON THE PAVEMENT WITH THE MEANING—OR THE MEANINGLESSNESS—OF LIFE IN YOUR GRASP. AND A ROPE COILS AS THOUGH AROUND SOME IDEAL NECK, BORROWING THE TONE OF A SUPPLIANT POWER: I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU FOREVER, I HAVE WATCHED YOUR TERRORS, YOUR STRUGGLES, AND YOUR RAGES, I HAVE SEEN YOUR RUMPLED SHEETS, THE PILLOW WHERE YOUR FURY GNAWED, AS I HAVE HEARD THE SWEARWORDS WITH WHICH YOU GRATIFIED THE GODS. CHARITABLE, I SYMPATHIZE AND OFFER MY SERVICES. FOR YOU WERE BORN TO HANG YOURSELF, LIKE ALL THOSE WHO DISDAIN AN ANSWER TO THEIR DOUBTS OR AN ESCAPE TO THEIR DESPAIR.”

UNDERSIDE OF AN OBSESSION
THE NOTION OF NOTHINGNESS IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF LABORING HUMANITY: THOSE WHO TOIL HAVE NEITHER TIME NOR INCLINATION TO WEIGH THEIR DUST; THEY RESIGN THEMSELVES TO THE DIFFICULTIES OR THE DOLTISHNESS OF FATE; THEY HOPE: HOPE IS A SLAVE’S VIRTUE.

IT IS THE VAIN, THE FATUOUS, AND THE COQUETTISH WHO, DREADING GRAY HAIR, WRINKLES AND THE DEATH RATTLE, FILL THEIR DAILY VACANCY WITH THE IMAGE OF THEIR OWN CARRION: THEY CHERISH AND DESPAIR OF THEMSELVES; THEIR THOUGHTS FLUTTER BETWEEN THE MIRROR AND THE GRAVEYARD, AND DISCOVER IN THE JEOPARDIZED FEATURES OF THEIR FACES TRUTHS AS SERIOUS AS THOSE OF RELIGION. EVERY METAPHYSIC BEGINS WITH AN ANGUISH OF THE BODY, WHICH THEN BECOMES UNIVERSAL; SO THAT THOSE OBSESSED BY FRIVOLITY PREFIGURE AUTHENTICALLY TORMENTED MINDS. THE SUPERFICIAL IDLER, HAUNTED BY THE SPECTER OF AGE, IS CLOSER TO PASCAL, BOSSUET, OR CHATEAUBRIAND THAN A SAVANT QUITE UNCONCERNED WITH HIMSELF. A TOUCH OF GENIUS IN VANITY: YOU HAVE THE GREAT PROUD MAN WHO FINDS DEATH HARD TO DEAL WITH—WHO TAKES IT AS A PERSONAL OFFENSE. BUDDHA HIMSELF, SUPERIOR TO ALL THE SAGES, WAS MERELY FATUOUS ON A DIVINE SCALE. HE DISCOVERED DEATH, HIS DEATH, AND, WOUNDED, RENOUNCED EVERYTHING AND IMPOSED HIS RENUNCIATION ON OTHERS. THUS THE MOST TERRIBLE AND THE MOST FUTILE SUFFERINGS ARE BEGOTTEN BY THAT CRUSHED PRIDE WHICH, IN ORDER TO FACE UP TO NOTHINGNESS, TRANSFORMS IT, OUT OF REVENGE, INTO LAW.

EPITAPH
“HE HAD THE PRIDE NEVER TO COMMAND OR TO PRESCRIBE ANYTHING, ANYONE. WITHOUT SUBALTERNS, WITHOUT MASTERS, HE NEITHER GAVE NOR RECEIVED ORDERS. EXCLUDED FROM THE EMPIRE OF LAWS AND SOMEHOW ANTERIOR TO GOOD AND EVIL, HE NEVER MADE A LIVING SOUL SUFFER. THE NAMES OF THINGS FADED FROM HIS MEMORY; HE LOOKED WITHOUT SEEING, LISTENED WITHOUT HEARING; SCENTS AND SAVORS VANISHED AT THE APPROACH OF HIS NOSTRILS, HIS PALATE. HIS SENSES AND HIS DESIRES WERE HIS ONLY SLAVES: HENCE THEY FELT, DESIRED NOTHING. HE FORGOT HAPPINESS AND MISERY, THIRST AND FEAR; AND IF HE HAPPENED TO RECALL THEM, HE SCORNED TO NAME THEM AND THEREBY TO SINK TO HOPE OR REGRET. THE MEREST GESTURE COST HIM MORE EFFORTS THAN IT WOULD COST OTHERS TO ESTABLISH OR OVERTHROW A KINGDOM. BORN WEARY OF BEING BORN, HE CHOSE TO BE A SHADE; WHEN, THEN, DID HE LIVE, AND BY THE TRANSGRESSION OF WHAT BIRTH? AND IF, LIVING, HE WORE HIS SHROUD, BY WHAT MIRACLE DID HE MANAGE TO DIE?”

SECULARIZATION OF TEARS
ONLY SINCE BEETHOVEN HAS MUSIC ADDRESSED ITSELF TO MEN: BEFORE HIM, IT WAS CONCERNED ONLY WITH GOD. BACH AND THE GREAT ITALIANS KNEW NOTHING OF THIS DESCENT TOWARD THE HUMAN, THIS FALSE TITANISM WHICH HAS DILUTED, SINCE THE DEAF MAN, THE PUREST ART. THE TORSION OF THE WILL REPLACED THE SUAVITIES; THE CONTRADICTION OF THE FEELINGS, THE NAIVE FLIGHT; FRENZY, THE DISCIPLINED SIGH: HEAVEN HAVING VANISHED FROM MUSIC, MAN WAS INSTALLED THERE. WHERE SIN HAD ONCE SPREAD IN GENTLE TEARS, IT NOW DISPLAYED ITSELF SO THAT DECLAMATION OVERTOOK PRAYER, AND THE ROMANTICISM OF THE FALL TRIUMPHED OVER THE HARMONIOUS DREAM OF DEPOSITION. . . .

BACH: LANGUOR OF COSMOGONY; A SCALE OF TEARS UPON WHICH OUR DESIRES FOR GOD ASCEND; ARCHITECTURE OF OUR FRAGILITIES, POSITIVE DISSOLUTION—THE HIGHEST OF ALL—OF OUR WILL; CELESTIAL RUIN IN HOPE; THE ONE MODE OF DESTROYING OURSELVES WITHOUT DISASTER, AND OF DISAPPEARING WITHOUT DYING. . . .

IS IT TOO LATE TO RELEARN SUCH DYING OUT? OR MUST WE GO ON FALTERING WITHOUT BENEFIT OF THE ORGAN’S CHORDS?

FLUCTUATIONS OF THE WILL
“DO YOU KNOW THAT FURNACE OF THE WILL IN WHICH NOTHING RESISTS YOUR DESIRES, WHERE FATALITY AND GRAVITATION LOSE THEIR EMPIRE AND VANISH BEFORE THE MAGIC OF YOUR POWER? CERTAIN THAT YOUR GAZE WOULD REVIVE THE DEAD, THAT YOUR HAND LAID UPON MATTER WOULD BRING IT TO LIFE, THAT STONES WOULD SHUDDER AT YOUR TOUCH, THAT EVERY GRAVEYARD WOULD BLOSSOM IN A SMILE OF IMMORTALITY—YOU TELL YOURSELF: 'FROM NOW ON THERE WILL BE NOTHING BUT AN ETERNAL SPRING, A DANCE OF WONDERS, AND THE END OF ALL SLEEP. I HAVE BROUGHT ANOTHER FIRE: THE GODS PALE AND THE CREATURES REJOICE; CONSTERNATION HAS SEIZED UPON THE VAULTS, AND THE DIN HAS DESCENDED INTO THE VERY TOMBS.'

“. . . AND THE AMATEUR OF PAROXYSMS, WINDED, FALLS SILENT ONLY TO RESUME, WITH THE ACCENT OF QUIETISM, WORDS OF ABANDON:

“ 'HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED THAT SOMNOLENCE WHICH IS TRANSMITTED TO THINGS, THAT SLACKNESS WHICH WEAKENS THE SAP AND SUGGESTS A TRIUMPHANT—AND ETERNAL—AUTUMN? EVEN AS I PASS ALL HOPES DROWSE, FLOWERS FADE, THE INSTINCTS WITHER: EVERYTHING STOPS WILLING, EVERYTHING REPENTS OF HAVING WILLED. AND EACH BEING WHISPERS TO ME: “LET SOMEONE ELSE HAVE LIVED MY LIFE, GOD OR GARTER SNAKE. I SIGH FOR A WILL TO INACTION, AN UNRELEASED INFINITY, AN ECSTATIC ATONY OF THE ELEMENTS, A HIBERNATION IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, WHICH WOULD BENUMB EVERYTHING, FROM HOG TO DRAGONFLY. . . .”’”

THEORY OF GOODNESS
SINCE FOR YOU THERE IS NO ULTIMATE CRITERION NOR IRREVOCABLE PRINCIPLE, AND NO GOD, WHAT KEEPS YOU FROM COMMITTING ANY AND EVERY CRIME?

“I FIND IN MYSELF AS MUCH EVIL AS IN ANYONE, BUT DETESTING ACTION—MOTHER OF ALL THE VICES—1 AM THE CAUSE OF NO ONE’S SUFFERING. HARMLESS, WITHOUT GREED, AND WITHOUT ENOUGH ENERGY OR INDECENCY TO AFFRONT OTHERS, I LEAVE THE WORLD AS ! FOUND IT. TO TAKE REVENGE PRESUPPOSES A CONSTANT VIGILANCE AND A SYSTEMATIC MIND, A COSTLY CONTINUITY, WHEREAS THE INDIFFERENCE OF FORGIVENESS AND CONTEMPT RENDERS THE HOURS PLEASANTLY EMPTY. ALL ETHICS REPRESENT A DANGER FOR GOODNESS; ONLY NEGLIGENCE RESCUES IT. HAVING CHOSEN THE PHLEGM OF THE IMBECILE AND THE APATHY OF THE ANGEL, I HAVE EXCLUDED MYSELF FROM ACTIONS AND, SINCE GOODNESS IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH LIFE, I HAVE DECOMPOSED MYSELF IN ORDER TO BE GOOD.”

MAKING ALLOWANCES
IT REQUIRES A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS TO DEVOTE ONESELF UNRESERVEDLY TO ANYTHING. BELIEVERS, LOVERS, DISCIPLES PERCEIVE ONLY ONE FACE OF THEIR DEITIES, THEIR IDOLS, THEIR MASTERS. THE WORSHIPPER REMAINS INELUCTABLY NAIVE. IS THERE A PURE FEELING WHICH FAILS TO BETRAY THE MIXTURE OF GRACE AND IMBECILITY, A BLISSFUL ADMIRATION WITHOUT AN ECLIPSE OF THE INTELLIGENCE? THE MAN WHO GLIMPSES SIMULTANEOUSLY ALL THE ASPECTS OF A BEING OR A THING REMAINS FOREVER UNDECIDED BETWEEN IMPULSE AND STUPOR. DISSECT ANY BELIEF: WHAT POMP OF THE HEART—AND HOW MUCH TURPITUDE UNDERNEATH! INFINITY DREAMED OF IN THE GUTTER RETAINS, INEFFACEABLE, ITS IMPRINT, ITS STENCH. THERE IS A NOTARY IN EVERY SAINT, A GROCER IN EVERY HERO, A CONCIERGE INSIDE THE MARTYR. THE DEPTH OF SIGHS CONCEALS A GRIMACE; SACRIFICES AND DEVOTIONS ARE MINGLED WITH THE VAPORS OF THE EARTHLY BORDELLO. CONSIDER LOVE: IS THERE A NOBLER OUTPOURING, A RAPTURE LESS SUSPECT? ITS SHUDDERS RIVAL MUSIC, COMPETE WITH THE TEARS OF SOLITUDE AND OF ECSTASY: SUBLIME, BUT A SUBLIMITY INSEPARABLE FROM THE URINARY TRACT: TRANSPORTS BORDERING UPON EXCRETION, A HEAVEN OF THE GLANDS, SUDDEN SANCTITY OF THE ORIFICES. . . . IT TAKES NO MORE THAN A MOMENT OF ATTENTION FOR THIS INTOXICATION, SHAKEN, TO CAST YOU BACK INTO THE ORDURES OF PHYSIOLOGY, OR A MOMENT OF FATIGUE TO RECOGNIZE THAT SO MUCH ARDOR PRODUCES ONLY A VARIETY OF MUCOUS. THE WAKING STATE IN OUR RAVISHMENTS ALTERS THEIR FLAVOR AND TRANSFORMS THEIR VICTIM INTO A VISIONARY TRAMPLING INEFFABLE PRETEXTS. WE CANNOT LOVE AND KNOW AT THE SAME TIME, WITHOUT LOVE SUFFERING AND EXPIRING UNDER THE MIND’S GAZE. SEARCH YOUR ADMIRATIONS, SCRUTINIZE THE BENEFICIARIES OF YOUR WORSHIP AND THE PROFITEERS OF YOUR ABANDONS: UNDER THEIR MOST DISINTERESTED THOUGHTS YOU WILL DISCOVER SELF-LOVE, THE SPUR OF FAME, THE THIRST FOR DOMINATION AND POWER. ALL THINKERS ARE ACTION’S EUNUCHS WHO TAKE REVENGE FOR THEIR FAILURE BY THE INTERMEDIARY OF CONCEPTS. BORN THIS SIDE OF THE DEED, THEY EXALT OR DECRY IT, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY ASPIRE TO HUMANITY’S GRATITUDE OR THAT OTHER FORM OF FAME: ITS HATRED; THEY UNDULY ERECT THEIR OWN DEFICIENCIES, THEIR OWN MISERIES TO THE RANK OF LAWS, THEIR FUTILITY TO THE LEVEL OF A PRINCIPLE. THOUGHT IS AS MUCH OF A LIE AS LOVE OR FAITH. FOR THE TRUTHS ARE FRAUDS AND THE PASSIONS ODORS; AND ULTIMATELY THERE IS NO CHOICE EXCEPT THE ONE BETWEEN WHAT LIES AND WHAT STINKS.

WONDERS OF VICE
WHEREAS A THINKER REQUIRES—TO DISSOCIATE HIMSELF FROM THE WORLD—AN ENORMOUS LABOR OF INTERROGATIONS, THE PRIVILEGE OF A FLAW CONFERS FROM THE START A SINGULAR DESTINY. VICE—BESTOWER OF SOLITUDE—OFFERS THE MAN MARKED OUT BY IT THE EXCELLENCE OF A SEPARATE CONDITION. CONSIDER THE INVERT: HE INSPIRES TWO CONTRADICTORY SENTIMENTS: DISGUST AND ADMIRATION; HIS “FAILURE” MAKES HIM AT ONCE INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR TO THE OTHERS; HE DOES NOT ACCEPT HIMSELF, CONSTANTLY JUSTIFIES HIMSELF, INVENTS REASONS, TORN BETWEEN SHAME AND PRIDE; YET—ENTHUSIASTS OF THE FATUITIES OF PROCREATION—WE GO WITH THE HERD. WOE TO THOSE WHO HAVE NO SEXUAL SECRETS! HOW COULD WE DIVINE THE FETID ADVANTAGES OF THE ABERRATIONS? SHALL WE REMAIN FOREVER THE PROGENITURE OF NATURE, VICTIMS OF HER LAWS, NOTHING BUT HUMAN TREES?

THE INDIVIDUAL’S DEFICIENCIES DETERMINE A CIVILIZATION’S FLEXIBILITY AND SUBTLETY. RARE SENSATIONS ARE CONDUCIVE TO THE MIND AND ITS VITALITY: THE DISTRACTED INSTINCT IS LOCATED AT THE ANTIPODES OF BARBARISM. CONSEQUENTLY AN IMPOTENT MAN IS MORE COMPLEX THAN A BRUTE WITH UNDISTURBED REFLEXES, AND REALIZES BETTER THAN ANYONE THE ESSENCE OF MANKIND, THAT DESERTER FROM ZOOLOGY, AND IS ENRICHED BY ALL ITS INADEQUACIES, ALL ITS IMPOSSIBILITIES. SUPPRESS VICES AND FLAWS, TAKE AWAY CARNAL DISORDERS, AND YOU WILL MEET NO MORE SOULS; FOR WHAT WE CALL BY THAT NAME IS MERELY A PRODUCT OF INNER SCANDALS, A DESIGNATION OF MYSTERIOUS SHAMES, AN IDEALIZATION OF ABJECTION. . . .

IN THE DEPTHS OF HIS NAÏVETE, THE THINKER ENVIES THE POSSIBILITIES OF KNOWLEDGE OPEN TO WHATEVER IS CONTRA NATURAM HE BELIEVES—NOT WITHOUT REPULSION—IN THE PRIVILEGES OF “MONSTERS". . . . VICE BEING A SUFFERING AND THE SOLE FORM OF CELEBRITY WORTH THE TROUBLE, THE “VICIOUS” MAN HAS TO BE DEEPER THAN THE COMMON RUN, SINCE UNSPEAKABLY SEPARATED FROM THE REST; HE BEGINS WHERE THE OTHERS LEAVE OFF. . . .

A NATURAL PLEASURE, TAKEN IN WHAT IS OBVIOUS, CANCELS ITSELF OUT, DESTROYS ITSELF IN ITS OWN MEANS, EXPIRES IN ITS ACTUALITY, WHEREAS AN UNWONTED SENSATION IS A THOUGHT OUT SENSATION, A REFLECTION IN THE REFLEXES. VICE ATTAINS THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS—WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIARY OF PHILOSOPHY; BUT THE THINKER REQUIRES A WHOLE LIFETIME TO ARRIVE AT THIS AFFECTIVE LUCIDITY BY WHICH THE PERVERT BEGINS. YET THEY RESEMBLE ONE ANOTHER IN THEIR PROPENSITY TO WREST THEMSELVES FROM THE OTHERS, THOUGH THE ONE STRIVES TO DO SO BY MEDITATION WHILE THE OTHER MERELY FOLLOWS THE WONDERS OF HIS INCLINATION.

THE CORRUPTER
“WHERE HAVE THE HOURS GONE? THE MEMORY OF A GESTURE, THE MARK OF A PASSION, THE LUSTER OF A RISK, A LOVELY, FUGITIVE MADNESS—NOTHING OF ALL THAT IN YOUR PAST; NO DELIRIUM BEARS YOUR NAME, NO VICE HONORS YOU. YOU HAVE SLIPPED THROUGH WITHOUT A TRACE; BUT WHAT WAS YOUR DREAM, THEN?

“I SHOULD HAVE LIKED TO SOW DOUBT INTO THE ENTRAILS OF THE GLOBE, TO IMBUE ITS SUBSTANCE WITH DOUBT, TO ENTHRONE DOUBT WHERE THE MIND NEVER PENETRATED, AND BEFORE REACHING THE MARROW OF MANKIND, TO SHAKE THE CALM OF STONES, TO INTRODUCE THERE THE INSECURITY AND THE ANGUISH OF THE HEART. ARCHITECT, I WOULD HAVE BUILT A TEMPLE TO RUIN; PREACHER, REVEALED THE FARCE OF PRAYER; KING, HOISTED THE FLAG OF REBELLION. AS MEN CHERISH A SECRET CRAVING TO REPUDIATE THEMSELVES, I SHOULD HAVE PROVOKED SELF-BETRAYAL EVERYWHERE, PLUNGED INNOCENCE INTO STUPOR, MULTIPLIED DISLOYALTIES, KEPT THE MULTITUDE FROM WALLOWING IN THE COMPOST HEAP OF CERTITUDES.”

THE ARCHITECT OF THE CAVES
THEOLOGY, ETHICS, HISTORY, AND EVERYDAY EXPERIENCE TEACH US THAT TO ACHIEVE EQUILIBRIUM THERE IS NOT AN INFINITY OF SECRETS; THERE IS ONLY ONE: SUBMIT “ACCEPT A YOKE,” THESE DISCIPLINES ALL REPEAT, AND YOU WILL BE HAPPY; BE SOMETHING AND YOU SHALL BE RELEASED FROM YOUR LABORS.” INDEED, ALL IS TASK HERE ON EARTH: PROFESSIONALS OF TIME, FUNCTIONARIES OF RESPIRATION, DIGNITARIES OF HOPE, A JOB IS WAITING FOR US BEFORE WE ARE BORN: OUR CAREERS ARE PREPARED IN THE WOMBS OF OUR MOTHERS. MEMBERS OF AN OFFICIAL UNIVERSE, WE HAVE TO OCCUPY A PLACE THERE, BY THE MECHANISM OF A RIGID FATE, WHICH IS LEFT VACANT ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE MAD; THEY, AT LEAST, ARE NOT CONSTRAINED TO HAVE A BELIEF, TO ADHERE TO AN INSTITUTION, TO SUSTAIN AN IDEA, TO PURSUE AN UNDERTAKING. SINCE SOCIETY WAS CONSTITUTED, THOSE WHO SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW FROM IT WERE PERSECUTED OR MOCKED. YOU ARE FORGIVEN EVERYTHING, PROVIDED YOU HAVE A TRADE, A SUBTITLE TO YOUR NAME, A SEAL ON YOUR NOTHINGNESS. NO ONE HAS THE AUDACITY TO EXCLAIM: “I DON’T WANT TO DO ANYTHING!” —WE ARE MORE INDULGENT WITH A MURDERER THAN WITH A MIND EMANCIPATED FROM ACTIONS. TO MULTIPLY THE POSSIBILITIES OF SUBMISSION, TO ABDICATE HIS FREEDOM, TO KILL THE VAGABOND IN HIMSELF—THUS HAS MAN REFINED HIS SLAVERY AND ENFEOFFED HIMSELF TO PHANTOMS. EVEN HIS SCORNS AND HIS REBELLIONS HAVE BEEN CULTIVATED ONLY SO HE CAN BE DOMINATED BY THEM, SERF THAT HE IS OF HIS ATTITUDES, HIS GESTURES, AND HIS MOODS. HAVING LEFT THE CAVES, HE HAS KEPT THEIR SUPERSTITION; HE WAS THEIR PRISONER, AND HAS BECOME THEIR ARCHITECT. HE PERPETUATES MS PRIMAL CONDITION WITH MORE INVENTION AND MORE SUBTLETY, BUT AT BOTTOM, DILATING OR DIMINISHING HIS CARICATURE, HE PLAGIARIZES HIMSELF BRAZENLY ENOUGH. A CHARLATAN SHORT OF TRICKS, HIS CONTORTIONS, HIS GRIMACES STILL DECEIVE, . . .

DISCIPLINE OF ATONY
LIKE WAX IN THE SUN, I DISSOLVE BY DAY AND SOLIDIFY AT NIGHT, AN ALTERNATION WHICH DECOMPOSES ME AND RESTORES ME TO MYSELF, A METAMORPHOSIS IN INERTIA AND SLOTH. . . . WAS IT HERE THAT ALL I HAVE READ AND LEARNED WAS TO END, WAS THIS THE GOAL OF MY VIGILS? IDLENESS HAS BLUNTED MY ENTHUSIASMS, SLACKENED MY APPETITES, ENERVATED MY FURY. THE MAN WHO FAILS TO LET HIMSELF GO SEEMS TO ME A MONSTER: I USE UP MY STRENGTH IN THE APPRENTICESHIP TO ABANDON, AND TRAIN MYSELF IN LEISURE, CONFRONTING MY WHIMS WITH THE PARAGRAPHS OF AN ART OF PUTRESCENCE.

EVERYWHERE PEOPLE WHO WILL . . . MASQUERADE OF STEPS HURRYING TOWARD MEAN OR MYSTERIOUS GOALS; CONFLICTING WILLS; EVERYONE WILLS; THE MOB WILLS; THOUSANDS BENT ON SOMETHING, ANYTHING. . . . I CANNOT FOLLOW, STILL LESS DEFY THEM; I STOP, STUPEFIED: WHAT MARVEL INSPIRED THEM WITH SUCH ENERGY? HALLUCINATING MOBILITY: IN SO LITTLE FLESH, SO MUCH VIGOR AND HYSTERIA! THESE BACTERIA THAT NO SCRUPLE CAN CALM, THAT NO WISDOM CAN SOOTHE, THAT NO GALL CAN DISCONCERT, . . . THEY BRAVE DANGERS WITH MORE APLOMB THAN ANY HERO: UNCONSCIOUS APOSTLES OF THE EFFECTIVE, THESE SAINTS OF THE IMMEDIATE . . . GODS IN THE CARNIVALS OF TIME. . . .

I TURN AWAY, AND STEP OFF THE SIDEWALKS OF THE WORLD. . . . YET THERE WAS A TIME WHEN I ADMIRED THE CONQUERORS AND THE BEES, WHEN I VERY NEARLY HOPED; BUT NOW, MOVEMENT MADDENS ME, AND ENERGY MERELY GRIEVES. THERE IS MORE WISDOM IN LETTING YOURSELF BE CARRIED BY THE WAVES THAN IN STRUGGLING AGAINST THEM. POSTHUMOUS TO MYSELF, I REMEMBER TIME AS A KIND OF CHILD’S PLAY OR A LAPSE OF TASTE. WITHOUT DESIRES, WITHOUT THE HOURS IN WHICH TO MAKE THEM BLOOM, I HAVE ONLY THE ASSURANCE OF HAVING ALWAYS OUTLIVED MYSELF, A FETUS DEVOURED BY AN OMNISCIENT IDIOCY EVEN BEFORE HIS EYELIDS OPENED, AND STILLBORN OF LUCIDITY. . . .

SUPREME EROSION
THERE IS SOMETHING WHICH RIVALS THE MOST SORDID TROLL, SOMETHING DIRTY, WORN, DEFEATED, AND WHICH PROVOKES AND AT THE SAME TIME DISCONCERTS FURY-—A PEAK OF EXASPERATION AND AN ARTICLE OF EVERY MOMENT: THE WORD, ANY WORD, AND MORE PRECISELY THE ONE WE MAKE USE OF. I SAY: TREE, HOUSE, ME, MAGNIFICENT, STUPID; I COULD SAY ANYTHING, AND I DREAM OF A MURDERER OF ALL NOUNS AND ALL ADJECTIVES, OF ALL THESE HONORABLE ERUCTATIONS. SOMETIMES IT SEEMS TO ME THEY ARE DEAD AND NO ONE WANTS TO BURY THEM. OUT OF COWARDICE, WE STILL CONSIDER THEM TO BE ALIVE AND GO ON ENDURING THEIR SMELL WITHOUT HOLDING OUR NOSES. YET THEY ARE NOT, NO LONGER EXPRESS, ANYTHING. WHEN WE THINK OF ALL THE MOUTHS THEY PASS THROUGH, ALL THE BREATHS THEY CORRUPT, ALL THE OCCASIONS ON WHICH THEY WERE OFFERED, CAN WE STILL EMPLOY A SINGLE ONE WITHOUT BEING POLLUTED?

THEY ARE TOSSED TO US PRE-CHEWED: YET WE WOULD NOT DREAM OF SWALLOWING FOOD ALREADY MASTICATED BY OTHERS: THE MATERIAL ACTION WHICH CORRESPONDS TO THE USE OF WORDS TURNS OUR STOMACH; YET ALL IT TAKES IS A MOMENT’S IRRITATION TO REALIZE, UNDER ANY WORD, AN AFTERTASTE OF SOMEONE ELSE’S SALIVA.

TO REFRESH LANGUAGE, HUMANITY WOULD HAVE TO STOP TALKING: IT WOULD RESORT PROFITABLY TO SIGNS, OR MORE EFFECTIVELY, TO SILENCE. PROSTITUTION OF THE WORD IS THE MOST VISIBLE SYMPTOM OF ITS DEGRADATION; THERE IS NO UTTERANCE INTACT, NO PURE ARTICULATION, AND DOWN TO THE VERY THINGS SIGNIFIED, EVERYTHING IS CORRUPTED BY REPETITIONS. WHY WOULD EACH GENERATION NOT LEARN A NEW IDIOM, IF ONLY TO GIVE A NEW VIGOR TO OBJECTS? HOW LOVE AND HATE, STRUGGLE AND SUFFER WITH THESE ANEMIC SYMBOLS? “LIFE,” “DEATH"—METAPHYSICAL STEREOTYPES, EXHAUSTED ENIGMAS. . . . MAN SHOULD CREATE ANOTHER ILLUSION OF REALITY AND INVENT TO THIS END OTHER WORDS, SINCE HIS OWN LACK BLOOD AND, AT THEIR STAGE OF AGONY, THERE IS NO TRANSFUSION POSSIBLE.

AT THE OBSEQUIES OF DESIRE
A TINY CAVE YAWNS IN EACH CELL . . . WE KNOW WHERE DISEASES SET IN, THEIR SITE, THE SPECIFIC WEAKNESS OF THE ORGANS; BUT THIS UNSPECIFIABLE ILL . . . THIS OPPRESSION UNDER THE WEIGHT OF A THOUSAND OCEANS, THIS DESIRE FOR AN IDEALLY BALEFUL POISON. . . .

ALL OF US, ALL OF US, ALL OF US

               TRYING TO SAVE

               OUR IMMORTAL SOULS, SOME WAYS

               SEEMINGLY MORE ROUND-

               ABOUT AND MYSTERIOUS

               THAN OTHERS.

DRINKING WHILE DRIVING
IT’S AUGUST AND I HAVE NOT

READ A BOOK IN SIX MONTHS

EXCEPT SOMETHING CALLED THE RETREAT FROM MOSCOW

BY CAULAINCOURT.

NEVERTHELESS, I AM HAPPY

RIDING IN A CAR WITH MY BROTHER

AND DRINKING FROM A PINT OF OLD CROW.

WE DO NOT HAVE ANY PLACE IN MIND TO GO,

WE ARE JUST DRIVING.

IF I CLOSED MY EYES FOR A MINUTE

I WOULD BE LOST, YET

I COULD GLADLY LIE DOWN AND SLEEP FOREVER

BESIDE THIS ROAD.

MY BROTHER NUDGES ME.

ANY MINUTE NOW, SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN.

LUCK
I WAS NINE YEARS OLD.

I HAD BEEN AROUND LIQUOR

ALL MY LIFE. MY FRIENDS

DRANK TOO, BUT THEY COULD HANDLE IT.

WE’D TAKE CIGARETTES, BEER,

A COUPLE OF GIRLS

AND GO OUT TO THE FORT.

WE’D ACT SILLY.

SOMETIMES YOU’D PRETEND

TO PASS OUT SO THE GIRLS

COULD EXAMINE YOU.

THEY’D PUT THEIR HANDS

DOWN YOUR PANTS WHILE

YOU LAY THERE TRYING

NOT TO LAUGH, OR ELSE

THEY WOULD LEAN BACK,

CLOSE THEIR EYES, AND

LET YOU FEEL THEM ALL OVER.

ONCE AT A PARTY MY DAD

CAME TO THE BACK PORCH

TO TAKE A LEAK.

WE COULD HEAR VOICES

OVER THE RECORD PLAYER,

SEE PEOPLE STANDING AROUND

LAUGHING AND DRINKING.

WHEN MY DAD FINISHED

HE ZIPPED UP, STARED A WHILE

AT THE STARRY SKY—IT WAS

ALWAYS STARRY THEN

ON SUMMER NIGHTS —

AND WENT BACK INSIDE.

THE GIRLS HAD TO GO HOME.

I SLEPT ALL NIGHT IN THE FORT

WITH MY BEST FRIEND.

WE KISSED ON THE LIPS

AND TOUCHED EACH OTHER.

I SAW THE STARS FADE

TOWARD MORNING.

I SAW A WOMAN SLEEPING

ON OUR LAWN.

I LOOKED UP HER DRESS,

THEN I HAD A BEER

AND A CIGARETTE.

FRIENDS, I THOUGHT THIS

WAS LIVING.

INDOORS, SOMEONE

HAD PUT OUT A CIGARETTE

IN A JAR OF MUSTARD.

I HAD A STRAIGHT SHOT

FROM THE BOTTLE, THEN

A DRINK OF WARM COLLINS MIX,

THEN ANOTHER WHISKY.

AND THOUGH I WENT FROM ROOM

TO ROOM, NO ONE WAS HOME.

WHAT LUCK, I THOUGHT.

YEARS LATER,

I STILL WANTED TO GIVE UP

FRIENDS, LOVE, STARRY SKIES,

FOR A HOUSE WHERE NO ONE

WAS HOME, NO ONE COMING BACK,

AND ALL I COULD DRINK.

DISTRESS SALE
EARLY ONE SUNDAY MORNING EVERYTHING OUTSIDE —

THE CHILD’S CANOPY BED AND VANITY TABLE,

THE SOFA, END TABLES AND LAMPS, BOXES

OF ASSORTED BOOKS AND RECORDS. WE CARRIED OUT

KITCHEN ITEMS, A CLOCK RADIO, HANGING

CLOTHES, A BIG EASY CHAIR

WITH THEM FROM THE BEGINNING

AND WHICH THEY CALLED UNCLE.

LASTLY, WE BROUGHT OUT THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF

AND THEY SET UP AROUND THAT TO DO BUSINESS.

THE SKY PROMISES TO HOLD FAIR.

I’M STAYING HERE WITH THEM, TRYING TO DRY OUT.

I SLEPT ON THAT CANOPY BED LAST NIGHT.

THIS BUSINESS IS HARD ON US ALL.

IT’S SUNDAY AND THEY HOPE TO CATCH THE TRADE

FROM THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH NEXT DOOR.

WHAT A SITUATION HERE! WHAT DISGRACE!

EVERYONE WHO SEES THIS COLLECTION OF JUNK

ON THE SIDEWALK IS BOUND TO BE MORTIFIED.

THE WOMAN, A FAMILY MEMBER, A LOVED ONE,

A WOMAN WHO ONCE WANTED TO BE AN ACTRESS,

SHE CHATS WITH FELLOW PARISHIONERS WHO

SMILE AWKWARDLY AND FINGER ITEMS

OF CLOTHING BEFORE MOVING ON.

THE MAN, MY FRIEND, SITS AT THE TABLE

AND TRIES TO LOOK INTERESTED IN WHAT

HE’S READING—FROISSART’S CHRONICLES IT IS,

I CAN SEE IT FROM THE WINDOW.

MY FRIEND IS FINISHED, DONE FOR, AND HE KNOWS IT.

WHAT’S GOING ON HERE? CAN NO ONE HELP THEM?

MUST EVERYONE WITNESS THEIR DOWNFALL?

THIS REDUCES US ALL.

SOMEONE MUST SHOW UP AT ONCE TO SAVE THEM,

TO TAKE EVERYTHING OFF THEIR HANDS RIGHT NOW,

EVERY TRACE OF THIS LIFE BEFORE

THIS HUMILIATION GOES ON ANY LONGER.

SOMEONE MUST DO SOMETHING.

I REACH FOR MY WALLET AND THAT IS HOW I UNDERSTAND IT:

I CAN’T HELP ANYONE.

YOUR DOG DIES
IT GETS RUN OVER BY A VAN.

YOU FIND IT AT THE SIDE OF THE ROAD

AND BURY IT.

YOU FEEL BAD ABOUT IT.

YOU FEEL BAD PERSONALLY,

BUT YOU FEEL BAD FOR YOUR DAUGHTER

BECAUSE IT WAS HER PET,

AND SHE LOVED IT SO.

SHE USED TO CROON TO IT

AND LET IT SLEEP IN HER BED.

YOU WRITE A POEM ABOUT IT.

YOU CALL IT A POEM FOR YOUR DAUGHTER,

ABOUT THE DOG GETTING RUN OVER BY A VAN

AND HOW YOU LOOKED AFTER IT,

TOOK IT OUT INTO THE WOODS

AND BURIED IT DEEP, DEEP,

AND THAT POEM TURNS OUT SO GOOD

YOU’RE ALMOST GLAD THE LITTLE DOG

WAS RUN OVER, OR ELSE YOU’D NEVER

HAVE WRITTEN THAT GOOD POEM.

THEN YOU SIT DOWN TO WRITE

A POEM ABOUT WRITING A POEM

ABOUT THE DEATH OF THAT DOG,

BUT WHILE YOU’RE WRITING YOU

HEAR A WOMAN SCREAM

YOUR NAME, YOUR FIRST NAME,

BOTH SYLLABLES,

AND YOUR HEART STOPS.

AFTER A MINUTE, YOU CONTINUE WRITING.

SHE SCREAMS AGAIN.

YOU WONDER HOW LONG THIS CAN GO ON.

PHOTOGRAPH OF MY FATHER IN HIS TWENTY-SECOND YEAR
OCTOBER. HERE IN THIS DANK, UNFAMILIAR KITCHEN

I STUDY MY FATHER’S EMBARRASSED YOUNG MAN’S FACE.

SHEEPISH GRIN, HE HOLDS IN ONE HAND A STRING

OF SPINY YELLOW PERCH, IN THE OTHER

A BOTTLE OF CARLSBAD BEER.

IN JEANS AND DENIM SHIRT, HE LEANS

AGAINST THE FRONT FENDER OF A 1934 FORD.

HE WOULD LIKE TO POSE BLUFF AND HEARTY FOR HIS POSTERITY,

WEAR HIS OLD HAT COCKED OVER HIS EAR.

ALL HIS LIFE MY FATHER WANTED TO BE BOLD.

BUT THE EYES GIVE HIM AWAY, AND THE HANDS

THAT LIMPLY OFFER THE STRING OF DEAD PERCH

AND THE BOTTLE OF BEER. FATHER, I LOVE YOU,

YET HOW CAN I SAY THANK YOU, I WHO CAN’T HOLD MY LIQUOR EITHER,

AND DON’T EVEN KNOW THE PLACES TO FISH?

HAMID RAMOUZ (1818—1906)
THIS MORNING I BEGAN A POEM ON HAMID RAMOUZ —

SOLDIER, SCHOLAR, DESERT EXPLORER —

WHO DIED BY HIS OWN HAND, GUNSHOT, AT EIGHTY-EIGHT.

I HAD TRIED TO READ THE DICTIONARY ENTRY ON THAT CURIOUS MAN

TO MY SON—WE WERE AFTER SOMETHING ON RALEIGH —

BUT HE WAS IMPATIENT, AND RIGHTLY SO.

IT HAPPENED MONTHS AGO, THE BOY IS WITH HIS MOTHER NOW,

BUT I REMEMBERED THE NAME: RAMOUZ —

AND A POEM BEGAN TO TAKE SHAPE.

ALL MORNING I SAT AT THE TABLE,

HANDS MOVING BACK AND FORTH OVER LIMITLESS WASTE,

AS I TRIED TO RECALL THAT STRANGE LIFE.

BANKRUPTCY
TWENTY-EIGHT, HAIRY BELLY HANGING OUT

OF MY UNDERSHIRT (EXEMPT)

I LIE HERE ON MY SIDE

ON THE COUCH (EXEMPT)

AND LISTEN TO THE STRANGE SOUND

OF MY WIFE’S PLEASANT VOICE (ALSO EXEMPT).

WE ARE NEW ARRIVALS

TO THESE SMALL PLEASURES.

FORGIVE ME (I PRAY THE COURT)

THAT WE HAVE BEEN IMPROVIDENT.

TODAY, MY HEART, LIKE THE FRONT DOOR,

STANDS OPEN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MONTHS.

THE BAKER
THEN PANCHO VILLA CAME TO TOWN,

HANGED THE MAYOR

AND SUMMONED THE OLD AND INFIRM

COUNT VRONSKY TO SUPPER.

PANCHO INTRODUCED HIS NEW GIRL FRIEND,

ALONG WITH HER HUSBAND IN HIS WHITE APRON,

SHOWED VRONSKY HIS PISTOL,

THEN ASKED THE COUNT TO TELL HIM

ABOUT HIS UNHAPPY EXILE IN MEXICO.

LATER, THE TALK WAS OF WOMEN AND HORSES.

BOTH WERE EXPERTS.

THE GIRL FRIEND GIGGLED

AND FUSSED WITH THE PEARL BUTTONS

ON PANCHO’S SHIRT UNTIL,

PROMPTLY AT MIDNIGHT, PANCHO WENT TO SLEEP

WITH HIS HEAD ON THE TABLE.

THE HUSBAND CROSSED HIMSELF

AND LEFT THE HOUSE HOLDING HIS BOOTS

WITHOUT SO MUCH AS A SIGN

TO HIS WIFE OR VRONSKY.

THAT ANONYMOUS HUSBAND, BAREFOOTED,

HUMILIATED, TRYING TO SAVE HIS LIFE, HE

IS THE HERO OF THIS POEM.

IOWA SUMMER
THE PAPERBOY SHAKES ME AWAKE. “I HAVE BEEN DREAMING YOU’D COME,”

I TELL HIM, RISING FROM THE BED. HE IS ACCOMPANIED

BY A GIANT NEGRO FROM THE UNIVERSITY WHO SEEMS

ITCHING TO GET HIS HANDS ON ME. I STALL FOR TIME.

SWEAT RUNS OFF OUR FACES; WE STAND WAITING.

I DO NOT OFFER THEM CHAIRS AND NO ONE SPEAKS.

IT IS ONLY LATER, AFTER THEY’VE GONE,

I REALIZE THEY HAVE DELIVERED A LETTER.

IT’S A LETTER FROM MY WIFE. “WHAT ARE YOU DOING

THERE?” MY WIFE ASKS. “ARE YOU DRINKING?”

I STUDY THE POSTMARK FOR HOURS. THEN IT, TOO, BEGINS TO FADE.

I HOPE SOMEDAY TO FORGET ALL THIS.

ALCOHOL
THAT PAINTING NEXT TO THE BROCADED DRAPERY

IS A DELACROIX. THIS IS CALLED A DIVAN

NOT A DAVENPORT; THIS ITEM IS A SETTEE.

NOTICE THE ORNATE LEGS.

PUT ON YOUR TARBOOSH. SMELL THE BURNT CORK

UNDER YOUR EYES. ADJUST YOUR TUNIC, SO.

NOW THE RED CUMMERBUND AND PARIS; APRIL 1934.

A BLACK CITRÖEN WAITS AT THE CURB.

THE STREET LAMPS ARE LIT.

GIVE THE DRIVER THE ADDRESS, BUT TELL HIM

NOT TO HURRY, THAT YOU HAVE ALL NIGHT.

WHEN YOU GET THERE, DRINK, MAKE LOVE,

DO THE SHIMMY AND THE BEGUINE.

AND WHEN THE SUN COMES UP OVER THE QUARTER

NEXT MORNING AND THAT PRETTY WOMAN

YOU’VE HAD AND HAD ALL NIGHT

NOW WANTS TO GO HOME WITH YOU,

BE TENDER WITH HER, DON’T DO ANYTHING

YOU’LL BE SORRY FOR LATER. BRING HER HOME

WITH YOU IN THE CITROËN, LET HER SLEEP

IN A PROPER BED. LET HER

FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU AND YOU

WITH HER AND THEN … SOMETHING: ALCOHOL,

A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL, ALWAYS ALCOHOL —

WHAT YOU’VE REALLY DONE

AND TO SOMEONE ELSE, THE ONE

YOU MEANT TO LOVE FROM THE START.

*

IT’S AFTERNOON, AUGUST, SUN STRIKING

THE HOOD OF A DUSTY FORD

PARKED ON YOUR DRIVEWAY IN SAN JOSE.

IN THE FRONT SEAT A WOMAN

WHO IS COVERING HER EYES AND LISTENING

TO AN OLD SONG ON THE RADIO.

YOU STAND IN THE DOORWAY AND WATCH.

YOU HEAR THE SONG. AND IT IS LONG AGO.

YOU LOOK FOR IT WITH THE SUN IN YOUR FACE.

BUT YOU DON’T REMEMBER.

YOU HONESTLY DON’T REMEMBER.

FOR SEMRA, WITH MARTIAL VIGOR

WELL OF COURSE I SAID

THEY SHOULD

I LIVED WITH A MAN ONCE SHE SAID

I DON’T KNOW WHY THE HELL

I LET YOU PICK ME UP

LOOKING FOR WORK [1]
I’VE ALWAYS WANTED BROOK TROUT

FOR BREAKFAST.

SUDDENLY, I FIND A NEW PATH

TO THE WATERFALL.

I BEGIN TO HURRY.

WAKE UP,

MY WIFE SAYS,

YOU’RE DREAMING.

BUT WHEN I TRY TO RISE,

THE HOUSE TILTS.

WHO’S DREAMING?

IT’S NOON, SHE SAYS.

MY NEW SHOES WAIT BY THE DOOR.

THEY ARE GLEAMING.

CHEERS
VODKA CHASED WITH COFFEE. EACH MORNING

I HANG THE SIGN ON THE DOOR:

OUT TO LUNCH

BUT NO ONE PAYS ATTENTION; MY FRIENDS

LOOK AT THE SIGN AND

SOMETIMES LEAVE LITTLE NOTES,

OR ELSE THEY CALL—COME OUT AND PLAY,

RAY-MOND.

ONCE MY SON, THAT BASTARD,

SLIPPED IN AND LEFT ME A COLORED EGG

AND A WALKING STICK.

I THINK HE DRANK SOME OF MY VODKA.

AND LAST WEEK MY WIFE DROPPED BY

WITH A CAN OF BEEF SOUP

AND A CARTON OF TEARS.

SHE DRANK SOME OF MY VODKA, TOO, I THINK,

THEN LEFT HURRIEDLY IN A STRANGE CAR

WITH A MAN I’D NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

THEY DON’T UNDERSTAND; I’M FINE,

JUST FINE WHERE I AM, FOR ANY DAY NOW

I SHALL BE, I SHALL BE, I SHALL BE…

I INTEND TO TAKE ALL THE TIME IN THIS WORLD,

CONSIDER EVERYTHING, EVEN MIRACLES,

YET REMAIN ON GUARD, EVER

MORE CAREFUL, MORE WATCHFUL,

AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD SIN AGAINST ME,

AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD STEAL VODKA,

AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD DO ME HARM.

ROGUE RIVER JET-BOAT TRIP,
GOLD BEACH, OREGON, JULY 4, 1977
THEY PROMISED AN UNFORGETTABLE TRIP,

DEER, MARTEN, OSPREY, THE SITE

OF THE MICK SMITH MASSACRE —

A MAN WHO SLAUGHTERED HIS FAMILY,

WHO BURNT HIS HOUSE DOWN AROUND HIS EARS —

A FRIED CHICKEN DINNER.

I AM NOT DRINKING. FOR THIS

YOU HAVE PUT ON YOUR WEDDING RING AND DRIVEN

500 MILES TO SEE FOR YOURSELF.

THIS LIGHT DAZZLES. I FILL MY LUNGS

AS IF THESE LAST YEARS

WERE NOTHING, A LITTLE OVERNIGHT PORTAGE.

WE SIT IN THE BOW OF THE JET-BOAT

AND YOU MAKE SMALL TALK WITH THE GUIDE.

HE ASKS WHERE WE’RE FROM, BUT SEEING

OUR CONFUSION, BECOMES

CONFUSED HIMSELF AND TELLS US

HE HAS A GLASS EYE AND WE

SHOULD TRY TO GUESS WHICH IS WHICH.

HIS GOOD EYE, THE LEFT, IS BROWN, IS

STEADY OF PURPOSE, AND DOESN’T

MISS A THING. NOT LONG PAST

I WOULD HAVE SNAGGED IT OUT

JUST FOR ITS WARMTH, YOUTH, AND PURPOSE,

AND BECAUSE IT LINGERS ON YOUR BREASTS.

NOW, I NO LONGER KNOW WHAT’S MINE, WHAT

ISN’T. I NO LONGER KNOW ANYTHING EXCEPT

I AM NOT DRINKING—THOUGH I’M STILL WEAK

AND SICK FROM IT. THE ENGINE STARTS.

THE GUIDE ATTENDS THE WHEEL.

SPRAY RISES AND FALLS ON ALL SIDES

AS WE HEAD UPRIVER.

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS
(AN EVENING WITH CHARLES BUKOWSKI)
YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS BUKOWSKI SAID

I’M 51 YEARS OLD LOOK AT ME

I’M IN LOVE WITH THIS YOUNG BROAD

I GOT IT BAD BUT SHE’S HUNG UP TOO

SO IT’S ALL RIGHT MAN THAT’S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE

I GET IN THEIR BLOOD AND THEY CAN’T GET ME OUT

THEY TRY EVERYTHING TO GET AWAY FROM ME

BUT THEY ALL COME BACK IN THE END

THEY ALL CAME BACK TO ME EXCEPT

THE ONE I PLANTED

I CRIED OVER THAT ONE

BUT I CRIED EASY IN THOSE DAYS

DON’T LET ME GET ONTO THE HARD STUFF MAN

I GET MEAN THEN

I COULD SIT HERE AND DRINK BEER

WITH YOU HIPPIES ALL NIGHT

I COULD DRINK TEN QUARTS OF THIS BEER

AND NOTHING IT’S LIKE WATER

BUT LET ME GET ONTO THE HARD STUFF

AND I’LL START THROWING PEOPLE OUT WINDOWS

I’LL THROW ANYBODY OUT THE WINDOW

I’VE DONE IT

BUT YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS

YOU DON’T KNOW BECAUSE YOU’VE NEVER

BEEN IN LOVE IT’S THAT SIMPLE

I GOT THIS YOUNG BROAD SEE SHE’S BEAUTIFUL

SHE CALLS ME BUKOWSKI

BUKOWSKI SHE SAYS IN THIS LITTLE VOICE

AND I SAY WHAT

BUT YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS

I’M TELLING YOU WHAT IT IS

BUT YOU AREN’T LISTENING

THERE ISN’T ONE OF YOU IN THIS ROOM

WOULD RECOGNIZE LOVE IF IT STEPPED UP

AND BUGGERED YOU IN THE ASS

I USED TO THINK POETRY READINGS WERE A COPOUT

LOOK I’M 51 YEARS OLD AND I’VE BEEN AROUND

I KNOW THEY’RE A COPOUT

BUT I SAID TO MYSELF BUKOWSKI

STARVING IS EVEN MORE OF A COPOUT

SO THERE YOU ARE AND NOTHING IS LIKE IT SHOULD BE

THAT FELLOW WHAT’S HIS NAME GALWAY KINNELL

I SAW HIS PICTURE IN A MAGAZINE

HE HAS A HANDSOME MUG ON HIM

BUT HE’S A TEACHER

CHRIST CAN YOU IMAGINE

BUT THEN YOU’RE TEACHERS TOO

HERE I AM INSULTING YOU ALREADY

NO I HAVEN’T HEARD OF HIM

OR HIM EITHER

THEY’RE ALL TERMITES

MAYBE IT’S EGO I DON’T READ MUCH ANYMORE

BUT THESE PEOPLE WHO BUILD

REPUTATIONS ON FIVE OR SIX BOOKS

TERMITES

BUKOWSKI SHE SAYS

WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL DAY

CAN’T YOU HEAR HER SAYING THAT

BUKOWSKI WHY DO YOU LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL DAY

THAT SURPRISES YOU DOESN’T IT

YOU WOULDN’T THINK A CRUDE BASTARD LIKE ME

COULD LISTEN TO CLASSICAL MUSIC ALL DAY

BRAHMS RACHMANINOFF BARTOK TELEMANN

SHIT I COULDN’T WRITE UP HERE

TOO QUIET UP HERE TOO MANY TREES

I LIKE THE CITY THAT’S THE PLACE FOR ME

I PUT ON MY CLASSICAL MUSIC EACH MORNING

AND SIT DOWN IN FRONT OF MY TYPEWRITER

I LIGHT A CIGAR AND I SMOKE IT LIKE THIS SEE

AND I SAY BUKOWSKI YOU’RE A LUCKY MAN

BUKOWSKI YOU’VE GONE THROUGH IT ALL

AND YOU’RE A LUCKY MAN

AND THE BLUE SMOKE DRIFTS ACROSS THE TABLE

AND I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW ONTO DELONGPRE AVENUE

AND I SEE PEOPLE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE SIDEWALK

AND I PUFF ON THE CIGAR LIKE THIS

AND THEN I LAY THE CIGAR IN THE ASHTRAY LIKE THIS

AND TAKE A DEEP BREATH

AND I BEGIN TO WRITE

BUKOWSKI THIS IS THE LIFE I SAY

IT’S GOOD TO BE POOR IT’S GOOD TO HAVE HEMORRHOIDS

IT’S GOOD TO BE IN LOVE

BUT YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE

YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE TO BE IN LOVE

IF YOU COULD SEE HER YOU’D KNOW WHAT I MEAN

SHE THOUGHT I’D COME UP HERE AND GET LAID

SHE JUST KNEW IT

SHE TOLD ME SHE KNEW IT

SHIT I’M 51 YEARS OLD AND SHE’S 25

AND WE’RE IN LOVE AND SHE’S JEALOUS

JESUS IT’S BEAUTIFUL

SHE SAID SHE’D CLAW MY EYES OUT IF I CAME UP HERE AND GOT LAID

NOW THAT’S LOVE FOR YOU

WHAT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT IT

LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING

I’VE MET MEN IN JAIL WHO HAD MORE STYLE

THAN THE PEOPLE WHO HANG AROUND COLLEGES

AND GO TO POETRY READINGS

THEY’RE BLOODSUCKERS WHO COME TO SEE

IF THE POET’S SOCKS ARE DIRTY

OR IF HE SMELLS UNDER THE ARMS

BELIEVE ME I WON’T DISAPPOINT EM

BUT I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS

THERE’S ONLY ONE POET IN THIS ROOM TONIGHT

ONLY ONE POET IN THIS TOWN TONIGHT

MAYBE ONLY ONE REAL POET IN THIS COUNTRY TONIGHT

AND THAT’S ME

WHAT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT LIFE

WHAT DO ANY OF YOU KNOW ABOUT ANYTHING

WHICH OF YOU HERE HAS BEEN FIRED FROM A JOB

OR ELSE HAS BEATEN UP YOUR BROAD

OR ELSE HAS BEEN BEATEN UP BY YOUR BROAD

I WAS FIRED FROM SEARS AND ROEBUCK FIVE TIMES

THEY’D FIRE ME THEN HIRE ME BACK AGAIN

I WAS A STOCKBOY FOR THEM WHEN I WAS 35

AND THEN GOT CANNED FOR STEALING COOKIES

I KNOW WHAT’S IT LIKE I’VE BEEN THERE

I’M 51 YEARS OLD NOW AND I’M IN LOVE

THIS LITTLE BROAD SHE SAYS

BUKOWSKI

AND I SAY WHAT AND SHE SAYS

I THINK YOU’RE FULL OF SHIT

AND I SAY BABY YOU UNDERSTAND ME

SHE’S THE ONLY BROAD IN THE WORLD

MAN OR WOMAN

I’D TAKE THAT FROM

BUT YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS

THEY ALL CAME BACK TO ME IN THE END TOO

EVERY ONE OF EM CAME BACK

EXCEPT THAT ONE I TOLD YOU ABOUT

THE ONE I PLANTED

WE WERE TOGETHER SEVEN YEARS

WE USED TO DRINK A LOT

I SEE A COUPLE OF TYPERS IN THIS ROOM BUT

I DON’T SEE ANY POETS

I’M NOT SURPRISED

YOU HAVE TO HAVE BEEN IN LOVE TO WRITE POETRY

AND YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO BE IN LOVE

THAT’S YOUR TROUBLE

GIVE ME SOME OF THAT STUFF

THAT’S RIGHT NO ICE GOOD

THAT’S GOOD THAT’S JUST FINE

SO LET’S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD

I KNOW WHAT I SAID BUT I’LL HAVE JUST ONE

THAT TASTES GOOD

OKAY THEN LET’S GO LET’S GET THIS OVER WITH

ONLY AFTERWARDS DON’T ANYONE STAND CLOSE

TO AN OPEN WINDOW

THE BLUE STONES
IF I CALL STONES BLUE IT IS BECAUSE

BLUE IS THE PRECISE WORD, BELIEVE ME.

— FLAUBERT

YOU ARE WRITING A LOVE SCENE

BETWEEN EMMA BOVARY AND RODOLPHE BOULANGER,

BUT LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

YOU ARE WRITING ABOUT SEXUAL DESIRE,

THAT LONGING OF ONE PERSON TO POSSESS ANOTHER

WHOSE ULTIMATE AIM IS PENETRATION.

LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

YOU WRITE AND WRITE THAT SCENE

UNTIL YOU AROUSE YOURSELF,

MASTURBATE INTO A HANDKERCHIEF.

STILL, YOU DON’T GET UP FROM THE DESK

FOR HOURS. YOU GO ON WRITING THAT SCENE,

WRITING ABOUT HUNGER, BLIND ENERGY —

THE VERY NATURE OF SEX —

A FIERY LEANING INTO CONSEQUENCE

AND EVENTUALLY, UTTER RUIN

IF UNBRIDLED. AND SEX,

WHAT IS SEX IF IT IS NOT UNBRIDLED?

YOU WALK ON THE STRAND THAT NIGHT

WITH YOUR MAGPIE FRIEND, ED GONCOURT.

YOU TELL HIM WHEN YOU WRITE

LOVE SCENES THESE DAYS YOU CAN JACKOFF

WITHOUT LEAVING YOUR DESK.

“LOVE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT,” YOU SAY.

YOU ENJOY A CIGAR AND A CLEAR VIEW OF JERSEY.

THE TIDE IS GOING OUT ACROSS THE SHINGLE,

AND NOTHING ON EARTH CAN STOP IT.

THE SMOOTH STONES YOU PICK UP AND EXAMINE

UNDER THE MOON’S LIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE BLUE

FROM THE SEA. NEXT MORNING WHEN YOU PULL THEM

FROM YOUR TROUSER POCKET, THEY ARE STILL BLUE.

— FOR MY WIFE

TEL AVIV AND LIFE ON THE MISSISSIPPI
THIS AFTERNOON THE MISSISSIPPI —

HIGH, ROILY UNDER A BROILING SUN,

OR LOW, RIPPLING UNDER STARLIGHT,

SET WITH DEADLY SNAGS COME OUT TO FISH

FOR STEAMBOATS —

THE MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON

HAS NEVER SEEMED SO FAR AWAY.

PLANTATIONS PASS IN THE DARKNESS;

THERE’S JONES’S LANDING APPEARING OUT

OF NOWHERE, OUT OF PINE TREES,

AND HERE AT 12-MILE POINT, GRAY’S

OVERSEER REACHES OUT OF FOG AND RECEIVES

A PACKET OF LETTERS, SOUVENIRS AND SUCH

FROM NEW ORLEANS.

BIXBY, THAT PILOT YOU LOVED,

FUMES AND BURNS:

D——NATION, BOY! HE STORMS AT YOU TIME AND AGAIN.

VICKSBURG, MEMPHIS, ST LOOEY, CINCINNATI,

THE PADDLEBLADES FLASH AND RUSH, RUSH

UPRIVER, SOUGHING AND CHURNING

THE DARK WATER.

MARK TWAIN YOU’RE ALL EYES AND EARS,

YOU’RE TAKING ALL THIS DOWN TO TELL LATER,

EVERYTHING,

EVEN HOW YOU GOT YOUR NAME,

QUARTER TWAIN, MARK TWAIN,

SOMETHING EVERY SCHOOLBOY KNEW

SAVE ONE.

I HANG MY LEGS FURTHER OVER THE BANISTER

AND LEAN BACK IN SHADE,

HOLDING TO THE BOOK LIKE A WHEEL,

SWEATING, FOOLING MY LIFE AWAY,

AS SOME CHILDREN HAGGLE,

THEN FIERCELY SLAP EACH OTHER

IN THE FIELD BELOW.

THE NEWS CARRIED TO MACEDONIA
ON THE BANKS OF THE

    RIVER THEY CALL INDUS TODAY

WE OBSERVE A KIND OF

BEAN

    MUCH LIKE THE EGYPTIAN BEAN

    ALSO

CROCODILES ARE REPORTED

UPSTREAM & HILLSIDES GROWN OVER

    WITH MYRRH & IVY

               HE BELIEVES

WE HAVE LOCATED THE HEADWATERS

OF THE RIVER NILE

    WE OFFER

SACRIFICE

HOLD GAMES

    FOR THE OCCASION

THERE IS MUCH REJOICING &

               THE MEN THINK

    WE SHALL TURN BACK

THESE ELEPHANTS THEIR

EMISSARIES OFFER

    ARE GIANT

TERRIFYING BEASTS YET

    WITH A GRIN HE YESTERDAY

RAN UP A LADDER ONTO

          THE VERY TOP OF ONE

    BEAST

THE MEN

               CHEERED HIM & HE

WAVED & THEY CHEERED HIM

    AGAIN

HE POINTED ACROSS THE RIVER

    & THE MEN GREW SILENT

THE BUILDERS

BUSY THEMSELVES WITH GREAT RAFTS

    AT THE WATER’S EDGE

         ON THE MORROW

WE AGAIN SET OUR FACES

    TO THE EAST

TONIGHT

               WIND    BIRDS

FILL THE AIR

    THE CLACKING OF THEIR BILLS

LIKE IRON ON IRON

THE WIND

               IS STEADY IS FRAGRANT

    WITH JASMINE

TRAIL OF THE COUNTRY BEHIND US

THE WIND MOVES

               THROUGH THE CAMP

STIRS THE TENTS OF

THE HETAERI

    TOUCHES EACH

OF THE SLEEPING SOLDIERS

EUOI! EUOI!

    MEN CRY OUT

IN THEIR SLEEP & THE HORSES

               PRICK THEIR EARS & STAND

    SHIVERING

IN A FEW HOURS

THEY ALL SHALL WAKE

    WITH THE SUN

SHALL FOLLOW THE WIND

               EVEN FURTHER

THE MOSQUE IN JAFFA
I LEAN OVER THE BALCONY OF THE MINARET.

MY HEAD SWIMS.

A FEW STEPS AWAY THE MAN WHO INTENDS

TO BETRAY ME BEGINS BY POINTING OUT

KEY SIGHTS —

MARKET CHURCH PRISON WHOREHOUSE.

KILLED, HE SAYS.

WORDS LOST IN THE WIND BUT

DRAWING A FINGER ACROSS HIS THROAT

SO I WILL GET IT.

HE GRINS.

THE KEY WORDS FLY OUT —

TURKS GREEKS ARABS JEWS

TRADE WORSHIP LOVE MURDER

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

HE GRINS AGAIN AT SUCH FOOLISHNESS.

HE KNOWS I AM WATCHING HIM.

STILL HE WHISTLES CONFIDENTLY

AS WE START DOWN THE STEPS

BUMPING AGAINST EACH OTHER GOING DOWN

COMMINGLING BREATH AND BODIES IN THE NARROW SPIRALLING DARK.

DOWNSTAIRS, HIS FRIENDS ARE WAITING

WITH A CAR. WE ALL OF US LIGHT CIGARETTES

AND THINK WHAT TO DO NEXT.

TIME, LIKE THE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES,

IS RUNNING OUT AS WE CLIMB IN.

NOT FAR FROM HERE
NOT FAR FROM HERE SOMEONE

IS CALLING MY NAME.

I JUMP TO THE FLOOR.

STILL, THIS COULD BE A TRAP.

CAREFUL, CAREFUL.

I LOOK UNDER THE COVERS FOR MY KNIFE.

BUT EVEN AS I CURSE GOD

FOR THE DELAY, THE DOOR IS THROWN OPEN

AND A LONG-HAIRED BRAT ENTERS

CARRYING A DOG.

WHAT IS IT, CHILD? (WE ARE BOTH

TREMBLING.) WHAT DO YOU WANT?

BUT THE TONGUE ONLY HOPS AND FLUTTERS

IN HER OPEN MOUTH

AS A SINGLE SOUND RISES IN HER THROAT.

I MOVE CLOSER, KNEEL

AND PLACE MY EAR AGAINST THE TINY LIPS.

WHEN I STAND UP—THE DOG GRINS.

LISTEN, I DON’T HAVE TIME FOR GAMES.

HERE, I SAY, HERE—AND I SEND HER AWAY

WITH A PLUM.

SUDDEN RAIN
•

RAIN HISSES ONTO STONES AS OLD MEN AND WOMEN

DRIVE DONKEYS TO COVER.

WE STAND IN RAIN, MORE FOOLISH THAN DONKEYS,

AND SHOUT, WALK UP AND DOWN IN RAIN AND ACCUSE.

•

WHEN RAIN STOPS THE OLD MEN AND WOMEN

WHO HAVE WAITED QUIETLY IN DOORWAYS, SMOKING,

LEAD THEIR DONKEYS OUT ONCE MORE AND UP THE HILL.

•

BEHIND, ALWAYS BEHIND, I CLIMB THROUGH THE NARROW STREETS.

I ROLL MY EYES. I CLATTER AGAINST STONES.

BALZAC
I THINK OF BALZAC IN HIS NIGHTCAP AFTER

THIRTY HOURS AT HIS WRITING DESK,

MIST RISING FROM HIS FACE,

THE GOWN CLINGING

TO HIS HAIRY THIGHS AS

HE SCRATCHES HIMSELF, LINGERS

AT THE OPEN WINDOW.

OUTSIDE, ON THE BOULEVARDS,

THE PLUMP WHITE HANDS OF THE CREDITORS

STROKE MOUSTACHES AND CRAVATS,

YOUNG LADIES DREAM OF CHATEAUBRIAND

AND PROMENADE WITH THE YOUNG MEN, WHILE

EMPTY CARRIAGES RATTLE BY, SMELLING

OF AXLE-GREASE AND LEATHER.

LIKE A HUGE DRAUGHT HORSE, BALZAC

YAWNS, SNORTS, LUMBERS

TO THE WATERCLOSET

AND, FLINGING OPEN HIS GOWN,

TRAINS A GREAT STREAM OF PISS INTO THE

EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY

CHAMBERPOT. THE LACE CURTAIN CATCHES

THE BREEZE. WAIT! ONE LAST SCENE

BEFORE SLEEP. HIS BRAIN SIZZLES AS

HE GOES BACK TO HIS DESK—THE PEN,

THE POT OF INK, THE STREWN PAGES.

COUNTRY MATTERS
A GIRL PUSHES A BICYCLE THROUGH TALL GRASS,

THROUGH OVERTURNED GARDEN FURNITURE, WATER

RISING TO HER ANKLES. CUPS WITHOUT HANDLES

SAIL UPON THE MURKY WATER, SAUCERS

WITH FINE CRACKS IN THE PORCELAIN.

AT THE UPSTAIRS WINDOW, BEHIND DAMASK CURTAINS,

THE STEWARD’S PALE BLUE EYES FOLLOW.

HE TRIES TO CALL.

SHREDS OF YELLOW NOTE PAPER

FLOAT OUT ONTO THE WINTRY AIR, BUT THE GIRL

DOES NOT TURN HER HEAD.

COOK IS AWAY, NO ONE HEARS.

THEN TWO FISTS APPEAR ON THE WINDOW SILL.

HE LEANS CLOSER TO HEAR THE SMALL

WHISPERINGS, THE BROKEN STORY, THE EXCUSES.

THIS ROOM
THIS ROOM FOR INSTANCE:

IS THAT AN EMPTY COACH

THAT WAITS BELOW?

    PROMISES, PROMISES,

    TELL THEM NOTHING

    FOR MY SAKE.

I REMEMBER PARASOLS,

AN ESPLANADE BESIDE THE SEA,

YET THESE FLOWERS…

    MUST I EVER REMAIN BEHIND —

    LISTENING, SMOKING,

    SCRIBBLING DOWN THE NEXT FAR THING?

I LIGHT A CIGARETTE

AND ADJUST THE WINDOW SHADE.

THERE IS A NOISE IN THE STREET

GROWING FAINTER, FAINTER.

RHODES
•

I DON’T KNOW THE NAMES OF FLOWERS

OR ONE TREE FROM ANOTHER,

NEVERTHELESS I SIT IN THE SQUARE

UNDER A CLOUD OF PAPISOSTROS SMOKE

AND SIP HELLAS BEER.

SOMEWHERE NEARBY THERE IS A COLOSSUS

WAITING FOR ANOTHER ARTIST,

ANOTHER EARTHQUAKE.

BUT I’M NOT AMBITIOUS.

I’D LIKE TO STAY, IT’S TRUE,

THOUGH I’D WANT TO HANG OUT

WITH THE CIVIC DEER THAT SURROUND

THE HOSPITALER CASTLE ON THE HILL.

THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL DEER

AND THEIR LEAN HAUNCHES FLICKER

UNDER AN ASSAULT OF WHITE BUTTERFLIES.

•

HIGH ON THE BATTLEMENT A TALL, STIFF

FIGURE OF A MAN KEEPS WATCH ON TURKEY.

A WARM RAIN BEGINS TO FALL.

A PEACOCK SHAKES DROPS OF WATER

FROM ITS TAIL AND HEADS FOR COVER.

IN THE MOSLEM GRAVEYARD A CAT SLEEPS

IN A NICHE BETWEEN TWO STONES.

JUST TIME FOR A LOOK

INTO THE CASINO, EXCEPT

I’M NOT DRESSED.

•

BACK ON BOARD, READY FOR BED,

I LIE DOWN AND REMEMBER

I’VE BEEN TO RHODES.

BUT THERE’S SOMETHING ELSE —

I HEAR AGAIN THE VOICE

OF THE CROUPIER CALLING

THIRTY-TWO, THIRTY-TWO

AS MY BODY FLIES OVER WATER,

AS MY SOUL, POISED LIKE A CAT, HOVERS —

THEN LEAPS INTO SLEEP.

SPRING, 480 BC
ENRAGED BY WHAT HE CALLED

    THE IMPERTINENCE OF THE HELLESPONT

                         IN BLOWING UP A STORM

               WHICH BROUGHT TO A HALT

                         HIS ARMY OF 2 MILLION,

                                        HERODOTUS RELATES

                         THAT XERXES ORDERED 300

                                        LASHES BE GIVEN

         THAT UNRULY BODY OF WATER BESIDES

    THROWING IN A PAIR OF FETTERS, FOLLOWED

               BY A BRANDING WITH HOT IRONS.

YOU CAN IMAGINE

    HOW THIS NEWS WAS RECEIVED

                         AT ATHENS; I MEAN

    THAT THE PERSIANS WERE ON THE MARCH.

NEAR KLAMATH
WE STAND AROUND THE BURNING OIL DRUM

AND WE WARM OURSELVES, OUR HANDS

AND FACES, IN ITS PURE LAPPING HEAT.

WE RAISE STEAMING CUPS OF COFFEE

TO OUR LIPS AND WE DRINK IT

WITH BOTH HANDS. BUT WE ARE SALMON

FISHERMEN. AND NOW WE STAMP OUR FEET

ON THE SNOW AND ROCKS AND MOVE UPSTREAM,

SLOWLY, FULL OF LOVE, TOWARD THE STILL POOLS.

AUTUMN
THIS YARDFUL OF THE LANDLORD’S USED CARS

DOES NOT INTRUDE. THE LANDLORD

HIMSELF, DOES NOT INTRUDE. HE HUNCHES

ALL DAY OVER A SWAGE,

OR ELSE IS ENVELOPED IN THE BLUE FLAME

OF THE ARC-WELDING DEVICE.

               HE TAKES NOTE OF ME THOUGH,

OFTEN STOPPING WORK TO GRIN

AND NOD AT ME THROUGH THE WINDOW. HE EVEN

APOLOGIZES FOR PARKING HIS LOGGING GEAR

IN MY LIVING ROOM.

               BUT WE REMAIN FRIENDS.

SLOWLY THE DAYS THIN, AND WE

MOVE TOGETHER TOWARDS SPRING,

TOWARDS HIGH WATER, THE JACK-SALMON,

THE SEA-RUN CUTTHROAT.

WINTER INSOMNIA
THE MIND CAN’T SLEEP, CAN ONLY LIE AWAKE AND

GORGE, LISTENING TO THE SNOW GATHER AS

FOR SOME FINAL ASSAULT.

IT WISHES CHEKHOV WERE HERE TO MINISTER

SOMETHING—THREE DROPS OF VALERIAN, A GLASS

OF ROSE WATER—ANYTHING, IT WOULDN’T MATTER.

THE MIND WOULD LIKE TO GET OUT OF HERE

ONTO THE SNOW. IT WOULD LIKE TO RUN

WITH A PACK OF SHAGGY ANIMALS, ALL TEETH,

UNDER THE MOON, ACROSS THE SNOW, LEAVING

NO PRINTS OR SPOOR, NOTHING BEHIND.

THE MIND IS SICK TONIGHT.

PROSSER
IN WINTER TWO KINDS OF FIELDS ON THE HILLS

OUTSIDE PROSSER: FIELDS OF NEW GREEN WHEAT, THE SLIPS

RISING OVERNIGHT OUT OF THE PLOWED GROUND,

AND WAITING,

AND THEN RISING AGAIN, AND BUDDING.

GEESE LOVE THIS GREEN WHEAT.

I ATE SOME OF IT ONCE TOO, TO SEE.

AND WHEAT STUBBLE-FIELDS THAT REACH TO THE RIVER.

THESE ARE THE FIELDS THAT HAVE LOST EVERYTHING.

AT NIGHT THEY TRY TO RECALL THEIR YOUTH,

BUT THEIR BREATHING IS SLOW AND IRREGULAR AS

THEIR LIFE SINKS INTO DARK FURROWS.

GEESE LOVE THIS SHATTERED WHEAT ALSO.

THEY WILL DIE FOR IT.

BUT EVERYTHING IS FORGOTTEN, NEARLY EVERYTHING,

AND SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, PLEASE GOD —

FATHERS, FRIENDS, THEY PASS

INTO YOUR LIFE AND OUT AGAIN, A FEW WOMEN STAY

A WHILE, THEN GO, AND THE FIELDS

TURN THEIR BACKS, DISAPPEAR IN RAIN.

EVERYTHING GOES, BUT PROSSER.

THOSE NIGHTS DRIVING BACK THROUGH MILES OF WHEAT FIELDS —

HEADLAMPS RAKING THE FIELDS ON THE CURVES —

PROSSER, THAT TOWN, SHINING AS WE BREAK OVER HILLS,

HEATER RATTLING, TIRED THROUGH TO BONE,

THE SMELL OF GUNPOWDER ON OUR FINGERS STILL:

I CAN BARELY SEE HIM, MY FATHER, SQUINTING

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD OF THAT CAB, SAYING, PROSSER.

AT NIGHT THE SALMON MOVE
AT NIGHT THE SALMON MOVE

OUT FROM THE RIVER AND INTO TOWN.

THEY AVOID PLACES WITH NAMES

LIKE FOSTER’S FREEZE, A & W, SMILEY’S,

BUT SWIM CLOSE TO THE TRACT

HOMES ON WRIGHT AVENUE WHERE SOMETIMES

IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS

YOU CAN HEAR THEM TRYING DOORKNOBS

OR BUMPING AGAINST CABLE TV LINES.

WE WAIT UP FOR THEM.

WE LEAVE OUR BACK WINDOWS OPEN

AND CALL OUT WHEN WE HEAR A SPLASH.

MORNINGS ARE A DISAPPOINTMENT.

WITH A TELESCOPE ROD ON COWICHE CREEK
HERE MY ASSURANCE DROPS AWAY. I LOSE

ALL DIRECTION. GRAY LADY

ONTO MOVING WATERS. MY THOUGHTS

STIR LIKE RUFFED GROUSE

IN THE CLEARING ACROSS THE CREEK.

SUDDENLY, AS AT A SIGNAL, THE BIRDS

PASS SILENTLY BACK INTO PINE TREES.

POEM FOR DR PRATT, A LADY PATHOLOGIST
•

LAST NIGHT I DREAMT A PRIEST CAME TO ME

HOLDING IN HIS HANDS WHITE BONES,

WHITE BONES IN HIS WHITE HANDS.

HE WAS GENTLE,

NOT LIKE FATHER MCCORMICK WITH HIS WEBBED FINGERS.

I WAS NOT FRIGHTENED.

•

THIS AFTERNOON THE MAIDS COME WITH THEIR MOPS

AND DISINFECTANT. THEY PRETEND I’M NOT

THERE, TALK OF MENSTRUAL CYCLES AS THEY

PUSH MY BED THIS WAY AND THAT. BEFORE LEAVING,

THEY EMBRACE. GRADUALLY, THE ROOM

FILLS WITH LEAVES. I AM AFRAID.

•

THE WINDOW IS OPEN. SUNLIGHT.

ACROSS THE ROOM A BED CREAKS, CREAKS

UNDER THE WEIGHT OF LOVEMAKING.

THE MAN CLEARS HIS THROAT. OUTSIDE,

I HEAR SPRINKLERS. I BEGIN TO VOID.

A GREEN DESK FLOATS BY THE WINDOW.

•

MY HEART LIES ON THE TABLE, A PARODY

OF AFFECTION, WHILE HER FINGERS RUMMAGE

THE ENDLESS STRING OF ENTRAILS.

THESE CONSIDERATIONS ASIDE,

AFTER ALL THOSE YEARS OF ADVENTURE IN THE FAR EAST,

I AM IN LOVE WITH THESE HANDS, BUT

I’M COLD BEYOND IMAGINING.

WES HARDIN: FROM A PHOTOGRAPH
TURNING THROUGH A COLLECTION

    OF OLD PHOTOGRAPHS

I COME TO A PICTURE OF THE OUTLAW,

    WES HARDIN, DEAD.

HE IS A BIG, MOUSTACHED MAN

    IN A BLACK SUITCOAT

ON HIS BACK OVER A BOARDFLOOR

    IN AMARILLO, TEXAS.

HIS HEAD IS TURNED AT THE CAMERA

    AND HIS FACE

SEEMS BRUISED, THE HAIR

    JARRED LOOSE.

A BULLET HAS ENTERED HIS SKULL

    FROM BEHIND

COMING OUT A LITTLE HOLE

    OVER HIS RIGHT EYE.

NOTHING SO FUNNY ABOUT THAT

    BUT THREE SHABBY MEN

IN OVERALLS STAND GRINNING

    A FEW FEET AWAY.

THEY ARE ALL HOLDING RIFLES

    AND THAT ONE

AT THE END HAS ON WHAT MUST BE

    THE OUTLAW’S HAT.

SEVERAL OTHER BULLETS ARE DOTTED

    HERE AND THERE

UNDER THE FANCY WHITE SHIRT

    THE DECEASED IS WEARING

— IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING —

    BUT WHAT MAKES ME STARE

IS THIS LARGE DARK BULLETHOLE

    THROUGH THE SLENDER, DELICATE-LOOKING

                                                RIGHT HAND.

MARRIAGE
IN OUR CABIN WE EAT BREADED OYSTERS AND FRIES

WITH LEMON COOKIES FOR DESSERT, AS THE MARRIAGE

OF KITTY AND LEVIN UNFOLDS ON PUBLIC TV.

THE MAN IN THE TRAILER UP THE HILL, OUR NEIGHBOR,

HAS JUST GOTTEN OUT OF JAIL AGAIN.

THIS MORNING HE DROVE INTO THE YARD WITH HIS WIFE

IN A BIG YELLOW CAR, RADIO BLARING.

HIS WIFE TURNED OFF THE RADIO WHILE HE PARKED,

AND TOGETHER THEY WALKED SLOWLY

TO THEIR TRAILER WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING.

IT WAS EARLY MORNING, BIRDS WERE OUT.

LATER, HE PROPPED OPEN THE DOOR

WITH A CHAIR TO LET IN SPRING AIR AND LIGHT.

IT’S EASTER SUNDAY NIGHT,

AND KITTY AND LEVIN ARE MARRIED AT LAST.

IT’S ENOUGH TO BRING TEARS TO THE EYES, THAT MARRIAGE

AND ALL THE LIVES IT TOUCHED. WE GO ON

EATING OYSTERS, WATCHING TELEVISION,

REMARKING ON THE FINE CLOTHES AND AMAZING GRACE

OF THE PEOPLE CAUGHT UP IN THIS STORY, SOME OF THEM

STRAINING UNDER THE PRESSURES OF ADULTERY,

SEPARATION FROM LOVED ONES, AND THE DESTRUCTION

THEY MUST KNOW LIES IN STORE JUST AFTER

THE NEXT CRUEL TURN OF CIRCUMSTANCE, AND THEN THE NEXT.

A DOG BARKS. I GET UP TO CHECK THE DOOR.

BEHIND THE CURTAINS ARE TRAILERS AND A MUDDY

PARKING AREA WITH CARS. THE MOON SAILS WEST

AS I WATCH, ARMED TO THE TEETH, HUNTING

FOR MY CHILDREN. MY NEIGHBOR,

LIQUORED UP NOW, STARTS HIS BIG CAR, RACES

THE ENGINE, AND HEADS OUT AGAIN, FILLED

WITH CONFIDENCE. THE RADIO WAILS,

BEATS SOMETHING OUT. WHEN HE HAS GONE

THERE ARE ONLY THE LITTLE PONDS OF SILVER WATER

THAT SHIVER AND CAN’T UNDERSTAND THEIR BEING HERE.

THE OTHER LIFE
NOW FOR THE OTHER LIFE. THE ONE

WITHOUT MISTAKES.

— LOU LIPSITZ

MY WIFE IS IN THE OTHER HALF OF THIS MOBILE HOME

MAKING A CASE AGAINST ME.

I CAN HEAR HER PEN SCRATCH, SCRATCH.

NOW AND THEN SHE STOPS TO WEEP,

THEN—SCRATCH, SCRATCH.

THE FROST IS GOING OUT OF THE GROUND.

THE MAN WHO OWNS THIS UNIT TELLS ME,

DON’T LEAVE YOUR CAR HERE.

MY WIFE GOES ON WRITING AND WEEPING,

WEEPING AND WRITING IN OUR NEW KITCHEN.

THE MAILMAN AS CANCER PATIENT
HANGING AROUND THE HOUSE EACH DAY

THE MAILMAN NEVER SMILES; HE TIRES

EASILY, IS LOSING WEIGHT,

THAT’S ALL; THEY’LL HOLD THE JOB —

BESIDES, HE NEEDED A REST.

HE WILL NOT HEAR IT DISCUSSED.

AS HE WALKS THE EMPTY ROOMS, HE

THINKS OF CRAZY THINGS

LIKE TOMMY AND JIMMY DORSEY,

SHAKING HANDS WITH FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

AT GRAND COULEE DAM,

NEW YEAR’S EVE PARTIES HE LIKED BEST;

ENOUGH THINGS TO FILL A BOOK

HE TELLS HIS WIFE, WHO

ALSO THINKS CRAZY THINGS

YET KEEPS ON WORKING.

BUT SOMETIMES AT NIGHT

THE MAILMAN DREAMS HE RISES FROM HIS BED

PUTS ON HIS CLOTHES AND GOES

OUT, TREMBLING WITH JOY…

HE HATES THOSE DREAMS

FOR WHEN HE WAKES

THERE’S NOTHING LEFT; IT IS

AS IF HE’D NEVER BEEN

ANYWHERE, NEVER DONE ANYTHING;

THERE IS JUST THE ROOM,

THE EARLY MORNING WITHOUT SUN,

THE SOUND OF A DOORKNOB

TURNING SLOWLY.

3 FAT TROUT HANG

TWO FRIENDS

    COME SLOWLY UP

THE TRACK.

    ONE OF THEM,

EX-HEAVYWEIGHT,

    WEARS AN OLD

    HE WANTS TO KILL,

THAT IS CATCH & EAT,

THE OTHER,

    MEDICAL MAN,

HE KNOWS THE CHANCES

    OF THAT.

HE THINKS IT FINE

    THAT THEY SHOULD

SIMPLY HANG THERE

    ALWAYS

IN THE CLEAR WATER.

    THE TWO KEEP GOING

BUT THEY

THEY DISAPPEAR

TORTURE
FOR STEPHEN DOBYNS

YOU ARE FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN. THIS TIME

IT IS A SOUTH AMERICAN GENERAL’S DAUGHTER.

YOU WANT TO BE STRETCHED ON THE RACK AGAIN.

YOU WANT TO HEAR AWFUL THINGS SAID TO YOU

AND TO ADMIT THESE THINGS ARE TRUE.

YOU WANT TO HAVE UNSPEAKABLE ACTS

COMMITTED AGAINST YOUR PERSON, THINGS

NICE PEOPLE DON’T TALK ABOUT IN CLASSROOMS.

YOU WANT TO TELL EVERYTHING YOU KNOW

ON SIMON BOLIVAR, ON JORGE LUIS BORGES,

ON YOURSELF MOST OF ALL.

YOU WANT TO IMPLICATE EVERYONE IN THIS!

EVEN WHEN IT’S FOUR O’CLOCK IN THE MORNING

AND THE LIGHTS ARE BURNING STILL —

THOSE LIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN BURNING NIGHT AND DAY

IN YOUR EYES AND BRAIN FOR TWO WEEKS —

AND YOU ARE DYING FOR A SMOKE AND A LEMONADE,

BUT SHE WON’T TURN OFF THE LIGHTS THAT WOMAN

WITH THE GREEN EYES AND LITTLE WAYS ABOUT HER,

EVEN THEN YOU WANT TO BE HER GAUCHO.

DANCE WITH ME, YOU IMAGINE HEARING HER SAY

AS YOU REACH FOR THE EMPTY BEAKER OF WATER.

DANCE WITH ME, SHE SAYS AGAIN AND NO MISTAKE.

SHE PICKS THIS MINUTE TO ASK YOU, HOMBRE,

TO GET UP AND DANCE WITH HER IN THE NUDE.

NO, YOU DON’T HAVE THE STRENGTH OF A FALLEN LEAF,

NOT THE STRENGTH OF A LITTLE REED BASKET

BATTERED BY WAVES ON LAKE TITICACA.

BUT YOU BOUND OUT OF BED

JUST THE SAME, AMIGO, YOU DANCE

ACROSS WIDE OPEN SPACES.

BOBBER
ON THE COLUMBIA RIVER NEAR VANTAGE,

WASHINGTON, WE FISHED FOR WHITEFISH

IN THE WINTER MONTHS; MY DAD, SWEDE —

MR LINDGREN—AND ME. THEY USED BELLY-REELS,

PENCIL-LENGTH SINKERS, RED, YELLOW, OR BROWN

FLIES BAITED WITH MAGGOTS.

THEY WANTED DISTANCE AND WENT CLEAR OUT THERE

TO THE EDGE OF THE RIFFLE.

I FISHED NEAR SHORE WITH A QUILL BOBBER AND A CANE POLE.

MY DAD KEPT HIS MAGGOTS ALIVE AND WARM

UNDER HIS LOWER LIP. MR LINDGREN DIDN’T DRINK.

I LIKED HIM BETTER THAN MY DAD FOR A TIME.

HE LET ME STEER HIS CAR, TEASED ME

ABOUT MY NAME “JUNIOR,” AND SAID

ONE DAY I’D GROW INTO A FINE MAN, REMEMBER

ALL THIS, AND FISH WITH MY OWN SON.

BUT MY DAD WAS RIGHT. I MEAN

HE KEPT SILENT AND LOOKED INTO THE RIVER,

WORKED HIS TONGUE, LIKE A THOUGHT, BEHIND THE BAIT.

HIGHWAY 99E FROM CHICO
THE MALLARD DUCKS ARE DOWN

FOR THE NIGHT. THEY CHUCKLE

IN THEIR SLEEP AND DREAM OF MEXICO

AND HONDURAS. WATERCRESS

NODS IN THE IRRIGATION DITCH

AND THE TULES SLUMP FORWARD, HEAVY

WITH BLACKBIRDS.

RICE FIELDS FLOAT UNDER THE MOON.

EVEN THE WET MAPLE LEAVES CLING

TO MY WINDSHIELD. I TELL YOU MARYANN,

I AM HAPPY.

THE COUGAR
FOR JOHN HAINES AND KEITH WILSON

I STALKED A COUGAR ONCE IN A LOST BOX-CANYON

OFF THE COLUMBIA RIVER GORGE NEAR THE TOWN AND RIVER

OF KLICKITAT. WE WERE LOADED FOR GROUSE. OCTOBER,

GRAY SKY REACHING OVER INTO OREGON, AND BEYOND,

ALL THE WAY TO CALIFORNIA. NONE OF US HAD BEEN THERE,

TO CALIFORNIA, BUT WE KNEW ABOUT THAT PLACE—THEY HAD

RESTAURANTS

THAT LET YOU FILL YOUR PLATE AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANTED.

I STALKED A COUGAR THAT DAY,

IF STALK IS THE RIGHT WORD, CLUMPING AND SCRAPING ALONG

UPWIND OF THE COUGAR, SMOKING CIGARETTES TOO,

ONE AFTER THE OTHER, A NERVOUS, FAT, SWEATING KID

UNDER THE BEST OF CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT THAT DAY

I STALKED A COUGAR…

AND THEN I WAS WEAVING DRUNK THERE IN THE LIVING ROOM,

FUMBLING TO PUT IT INTO WORDS, SMACKED AND SCATTERED

WITH THE MEMORY OF IT AFTER YOU TWO HAD PUT YOUR STORIES,

BLACK BEAR STORIES, OUT ON THE TABLE.

SUDDENLY I WAS BACK IN THAT CANYON, IN THAT GONE STATE.

SOMETHING I HADN’T THOUGHT ABOUT FOR YEARS:

HOW I STALKED A COUGAR THAT DAY.

SO I TOLD IT. TRIED TO ANYWAY,

HAINES AND I PRETTY DRUNK NOW. WILSON LISTENING, LISTENING,

THEN SAYING, YOU SURE IT WASN’T A BOBCAT?

WHICH I SECRETLY TOOK AS A PUT-DOWN, HE FROM THE SOUTHWEST,

POET WHO HAD READ THAT NIGHT,

AND ANY FOOL ABLE TO TELL A BOBCAT FROM A COUGAR,

EVEN A DRUNK WRITER LIKE ME,

YEARS LATER, AT THE SMORGASBORD, IN CALIFORNIA.

HELL. AND THEN THE COUGAR SMOOTH-LOPED OUT OF THE BRUSH

RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME—GOD, HOW BIG AND BEAUTIFUL HE WAS —

JUMPED ONTO A ROCK AND TURNED HIS HEAD

TO LOOK AT ME. TO LOOK AT ME! I LOOKED BACK, FORGETTING TO SHOOT.

THEN HE JUMPED AGAIN, RAN CLEAR OUT OF MY LIFE.

THE CURRENT
THESE FISH HAVE NO EYES

THESE SILVER FISH THAT COME TO ME IN DREAMS,

SCATTERING THEIR ROE AND MILT

IN THE POCKETS OF MY BRAIN.

BUT THERE’S ONE THAT COMES —

HEAVY, SCARRED, SILENT LIKE THE REST,

THAT SIMPLY HOLDS AGAINST THE CURRENT,

CLOSING ITS DARK MOUTH AGAINST

THE CURRENT, CLOSING AND OPENING

AS IT HOLDS TO THE CURRENT.

HUNTER
HALF ASLEEP ON TOP OF THIS BLEAK LANDSCAPE,

SURROUNDED BY CHUKKERS,

I CROUCH BEHIND A PILE OF ROCKS AND DREAM

I EMBRACE MY BABYSITTER.

A FEW INCHES FROM MY FACE

HER COOL AND YOUTHFUL EYES STARE AT ME FROM TWO REMAINING

WILDFLOWERS. THERE’S A QUESTION IN THOSE EYES

I CAN’T ANSWER. WHO IS TO JUDGE THESE THINGS?

BUT DEEP UNDER MY WINTER UNDERWEAR,

MY BLOOD STIRS.

SUDDENLY, HER HAND RISES IN ALARM —

THE GEESE ARE STREAMING OFF THEIR RIVER ISLAND,

RISING, RISING UP THIS GORGE.

I MOVE THE SAFETY. THE BODY GATHERS, LEANS TO ITS WORK.

BELIEVE IN THE FINGERS.

BELIEVE IN THE NERVES.

BELIEVE IN THIS.

TRYING TO SLEEP LATE ON A
SATURDAY MORNING IN NOVEMBER
IN THE LIVING ROOM WALTER CRONKITE

PREPARES US FOR THE MOON SHOT.

WE ARE APPROACHING

THE THIRD AND FINAL PHASE, THIS

IS THE LAST EXERCISE.

I SETTLE DOWN,

FAR DOWN INTO THE COVERS.

MY SON IS WEARING HIS SPACE HELMET.

I SEE HIM MOVE DOWN THE LONG AIRLESS CORRIDOR,

HIS IRON BOOTS DRAGGING.

MY OWN FEET GROW COLD.

I DREAM OF YELLOW JACKETS AND NEAR

FROSTBITE, TWO HAZARDS

FACING THE WHITEFISH FISHERMEN

ON SATUS CREEK.

BUT THERE IS SOMETHING MOVING

THERE IN THE FROZEN REEDS,

SOMETHING ON ITS SIDE THAT IS

SLOWLY FILLING WITH WATER.

I TURN ONTO MY BACK.

ALL OF ME IS LIFTING AT ONCE,

AS IF IT WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO DROWN.

LOUISE
IN THE TRAILER NEXT TO THIS ONE

A WOMAN PICKS AT A CHILD NAMED LOUISE.

DIDN’T I TELL YOU, DUMMY, TO KEEP THIS DOOR CLOSED?

JESUS, IT’S WINTER!

YOU WANT TO PAY THE ELECTRIC BILL?

WIPE YOUR FEET, FOR CHRIST’S SAKE!

LOUISE, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH YOU?

OH, WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH YOU, LOUISE?

THE WOMAN SINGS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT.

TODAY THE WOMAN AND CHILD ARE OUT

HANGING UP WASH.

SAY HELLO TO THIS MAN, THE WOMAN SAYS

TO LOUISE. LOUISE!

THIS IS LOUISE, THE WOMAN SAYS

AND GIVES LOUISE A JERK.

CAT’S GOT HER TONGUE, THE WOMAN SAYS.

BUT LOUISE HAS PINS IN HER MOUTH,

WET CLOTHES IN HER ARMS. SHE PULLS

THE LINE DOWN, HOLDS THE LINE

WITH HER NECK

AS SHE SLINGS THE SHIRT

OVER THE LINE AND LETS GO —

THE SHIRT FILLING OUT, FLAPPING

OVER HER HEAD. SHE DUCKS

AND JUMPS BACK—JUMPS BACK

FROM THIS NEAR HUMAN SHAPE.

POEM FOR KARL WALLENDA,
AERIALIST SUPREME
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE, WIND TAILED YOU

ALL OVER MAGDEBURG. IN VIENNA WIND LOOKED FOR YOU

IN FIRST ONE COURTYARD THEN ANOTHER.

IT OVERTURNED FOUNTAINS, IT MADE YOUR HAIR STAND ON END.

IN PRAGUE WIND ACCOMPANIED SERIOUS YOUNG COUPLES

JUST STARTING FAMILIES. BUT YOU MADE THEIR BREATHS CATCH,

THOSE LADIES IN LONG WHITE DRESSES,

THE MEN WITH THEIR MOUSTACHES AND HIGH COLLARS.

IT WAITED IN THE CUFFS OF YOUR SLEEVES

WHEN YOU BOWED TO THE EMPEROR HAILE SELASSIE.

IT WAS THERE WHEN YOU SHOOK HANDS

WITH THE DEMOCRATIC KING OF THE BELGIANS.

WIND ROLLED MANGOES AND GARBAGE SACKS DOWN THE STREETS OF NAIROBI.

YOU SAW WIND PURSUING ZEBRAS ACROSS THE SERENGETI PLAIN.

WIND JOINED YOU AS YOU STEPPED OFF THE EAVES OF SUBURBAN HOUSES

IN SARASOTA, FLORIDA. IT MADE LITTLE NOISES

IN TREES AT EVERY CROSSROADS TOWN, EVERY CIRCUS STOP.

YOU REMARKED ON IT ALL YOUR LIFE,

HOW IT COULD COME FROM NOWHERE,

HOW IT STIRRED THE PUFFY FACES OF THE HYDRANGEAS

BELOW HOTEL ROOM BALCONIES WHILE YOU

DREW ON YOUR BIG HAVANA AND WATCHED

THE SMOKE STREAM SOUTH, ALWAYS SOUTH,

TOWARD PUERTO RICO AND THE TORRID ZONE.

THAT MORNING, 74 YEARS OLD AND 10 STORIES UP,

MIDWAY BETWEEN HOTEL AND HOTEL, A PROMOTIONAL STUNT

ON THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING, THAT WIND

WHICH HAS BEEN EVERYWHERE WITH YOU

COMES IN FROM THE CARIBBEAN TO THROW ITSELF

ONCE AND FOR ALL INTO YOUR ARMS, LIKE A YOUNG LOVER!

YOUR HAIR STANDS ON END.

YOU TRY TO CROUCH, TO REACH FOR WIRE.

LATER, MEN COME ALONG TO CLEAN UP

AND TO TAKE DOWN THE WIRE. THEY TAKE DOWN THE WIRE

WHERE YOU SPENT YOUR LIFE. IMAGINE THAT: WIRE.

DESCHUTES RIVER
THIS SKY, FOR INSTANCE:

CLOSED, GRAY,

BUT IT HAS STOPPED SNOWING

SO THAT IS SOMETHING. I AM

SO COLD I CANNOT BEND

MY FINGERS.

WALKING DOWN TO THE RIVER THIS MORNING

WE SURPRISED A BADGER

TEARING A RABBIT.

BADGER HAD A BLOODY NOSE,

BLOOD ON ITS SNOUT UP TO ITS SHARP EYES:

    PROWESS IS NOT TO BE CONFUSED

    WITH GRACE.

LATER, EIGHT MALLARD DUCKS FLY OVER

WITHOUT LOOKING DOWN. ON THE RIVER

FRANK SANDMEYER TROLLS, TROLLS

FOR STEELHEAD. HE HAS FISHED

THIS RIVER FOR YEARS

BUT FEBRUARY IS THE BEST MONTH

HE SAYS.

SNARLED, MITTENLESS,

I HANDLE A MAZE OF NYLON.

FAR AWAY —

ANOTHER MAN IS RAISING MY CHILDREN,

BEDDING MY WIFE BEDDING MY WIFE.

FOREVER
DRIFTING OUTSIDE IN A PALL OF SMOKE,

I FOLLOW A SNAIL’S STREAKED PATH DOWN

THE GARDEN TO THE GARDEN’S STONE WALL.

ALONE AT LAST I SQUAT ON MY HEELS, SEE

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE, AND SUDDENLY

AFFIX MYSELF TO THE DAMP STONE.

I BEGIN TO LOOK AROUND ME SLOWLY

AND LISTEN, EMPLOYING

MY ENTIRE BODY AS THE SNAIL

EMPLOYS ITS BODY, RELAXED, BUT ALERT.

AMAZING! TONIGHT IS A MILESTONE

IN MY LIFE. AFTER TONIGHT

HOW CAN I EVER GO BACK TO THAT

OTHER LIFE? I KEEP MY EYES

ON THE STARS, WAVE TO THEM

WITH MY FEELERS. I HOLD ON

FOR HOURS, JUST RESTING.

STILL LATER, GRIEF BEGINS TO SETTLE

AROUND MY HEART IN TINY DROPS.

I REMEMBER MY FATHER IS DEAD,

AND I AM GOING AWAY FROM THIS

TOWN SOON. FOREVER.

GOODBYE, SON, MY FATHER SAYS.

TOWARD MORNING, I CLIMB DOWN

AND WANDER BACK INTO THE HOUSE.

THEY ARE STILL WAITING,

FRIGHT SPLASHED ON THEIR FACES,

AS THEY MEET MY NEW EYES FOR THE FIRST TIME.

WOOLWORTH’S, 1954
WHERE THIS FLOATED UP FROM, OR WHY,

I DON’T KNOW. BUT THINKING ABOUT THIS

SINCE JUST AFTER ROBERT CALLED

TELLING ME HE’D BE HERE IN A FEW

MINUTES TO GO CLAMMING.

HOW ON MY FIRST JOB I WORKED

UNDER A MAN NAMED SOL.

FIFTY-SOME YEARS OLD, BUT

A STOCKBOY LIKE I WAS.

HAD WORKED HIS WAY

UP TO NOTHING. BUT GRATEFUL

FOR HIS JOB, SAME AS ME.

HE KNEW EVERYTHING THERE WAS

TO KNOW ABOUT THAT DIME-STORE

MERCHANDISE AND WAS WILLING

TO SHOW ME. I WAS SIXTEEN, WORKING

FOR SIX BITS AN HOUR. LOVING IT

THAT I WAS. SOL TAUGHT ME

WHAT HE KNEW. HE WAS PATIENT,

THOUGH IT HELPED I LEARNED FAST.

MOST IMPORTANT MEMORY

OF THAT WHOLE TIME: OPENING

THE CARTONS OF WOMEN’S LINGERIE.

UNDERPANTS, AND SOFT, CLINGY THINGS

LIKE THAT. TAKING IT OUT

OF CARTONS BY THE HANDFUL. SOMETHING

SWEET AND MYSTERIOUS ABOUT THOSE

THINGS EVEN THEN. SOL CALLED IT

“LINGER-EY.” “LINGER-EY?”

WHAT DID I KNOW? I CALLED IT

THAT FOR A WHILE, TOO. “LINGER-EY.”

THEN I GOT OLDER. QUIT BEING

A STOCKBOY. STARTED PRONOUNCING

THAT FROG WORD RIGHT.

I KNEW WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT!

WENT TO TAKING GIRLS OUT

IN HOPES OF TOUCHING THAT SOFTNESS,

SLIPPING DOWN THOSE UNDERPANTS.

AND SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED. GOD,

THEY LET ME. AND THEY WERE

LINGER-EY, THOSE UNDERPANTS.

THEY TENDED TO LINGER A LITTLE

SOMETIMES, AS THEY SLIPPED DOWN

OFF THE BELLY, CLINGING LIGHTLY

TO THE HOT WHITE SKIN.

PASSING OVER THE HIPS AND BUTTOCKS

AND BEAUTIFUL THIGHS, TRAVELING

FASTER NOW AS THEY CROSSED THE KNEES,

THE CALVES! REACHING THE ANKLES,

BROUGHT TOGETHER FOR THIS

OCCASION. AND KICKED FREE

ONTO THE FLOOR OF THE CAR AND

FORGOTTEN ABOUT. UNTIL YOU HAD

TO LOOK FOR THEM.

“LINGER-EY.”

THOSE SWEET GIRLS!

“LINGER A LITTLE, FOR THOU ART FAIR.”

I KNOW WHO SAID THAT. IT FITS,

AND I’LL USE IT. ROBERT AND HIS

KIDS AND I OUT THERE ON THE FLATS

WITH OUR BUCKETS AND SHOVELS.

HIS KIDS, WHO WON’T EAT CLAMS, CUTTING

UP THE WHOLE TIME, SAYING “YUCK”

OR “UGH” AS CLAMS TURNED

UP IN THE SHOVELS FULL OF SAND

AND WERE TOSSED INTO THE BUCKET.

ME THINKING ALL THE WHILE

OF THOSE EARLY DAYS IN YAKIMA.

AND SMOOTH-AS-SILK UNDERPANTS.

THE LINGERING KIND THAT JEANNE WORE,

AND RITA, MURIEL, SUE, AND HER SISTER,

CORA MAE. ALL THOSE GIRLS.

GROWNUP NOW. OR WORSE.

I’LL SAY IT: DEAD.

RADIO WAVES
FOR ANTONIO MACHADO

  THIS RAIN HAS STOPPED, AND THE MOON HAS COME OUT.

I DON’T UNDERSTAND THE FIRST THING ABOUT RADIO

WAVES. BUT I THINK THEY TRAVEL BETTER JUST AFTER

A RAIN, WHEN THE AIR IS DAMP. ANYWAY, I CAN REACH OUT

NOW AND PICK UP OTTAWA, IF I WANT TO, OR TORONTO.

LATELY, AT NIGHT, I’VE FOUND MYSELF

BECOMING SLIGHTLY INTERESTED IN CANADIAN POLITICS

AND DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. IT’S TRUE. BUT MOSTLY IT WAS THEIR

MUSIC STATIONS I WAS AFTER. I COULD SIT HERE IN THE CHAIR

AND LISTEN, WITHOUT HAVING TO DO ANYTHING, OR THINK.

I DON’T HAVE A TV, AND I’D QUIT READING

THE PAPERS. AT NIGHT I TURNED ON THE RADIO.

    WHEN I CAME OUT HERE I WAS TRYING TO GET AWAY

FROM EVERYTHING. ESPECIALLY LITERATURE.

WHAT THAT ENTAILS, AND WHAT COMES AFTER.

THERE IS IN THE SOUL A DESIRE FOR NOT THINKING.

FOR BEING STILL. COUPLED WITH THIS

A DESIRE TO BE STRICT, YES, AND RIGOROUS.

BUT THE SOUL IS ALSO A SMOOTH SON OF A BITCH,

NOT ALWAYS TRUSTWORTHY. AND I FORGOT THAT.

I LISTENED WHEN IT SAID, BETTER TO SING THAT WHICH IS GONE

AND WILL NOT RETURN THAN THAT WHICH IS STILL

WITH US AND WILL BE WITH US TOMORROW. OR NOT.

AND IF NOT, THAT’S ALL RIGHT TOO.

IT DIDN’T MUCH MATTER, IT SAID, IF A MAN SANG AT ALL.

THAT’S THE VOICE I LISTENED TO.

CAN YOU IMAGINE SOMEBODY THINKING LIKE THIS?

THAT IT’S REALLY ALL ONE AND THE SAME?

WHAT NONSENSE!

BUT I’D THINK THESE STUPID THOUGHTS AT NIGHT

AS I SAT IN THE CHAIR AND LISTENED TO MY RADIO.

    THEN, MACHADO, YOUR POETRY!

IT WAS A LITTLE LIKE A MIDDLE-AGED MAN FALLING

IN LOVE AGAIN. A REMARKABLE THING TO WITNESS,

AND EMBARRASSING, TOO.

SILLY THINGS LIKE PUTTING YOUR PICTURE UP.

AND I TOOK YOUR BOOK TO BED WITH ME

AND SLEPT WITH IT NEAR AT HAND. A TRAIN WENT BY

IN MY DREAMS ONE NIGHT AND WOKE ME UP.

AND THE FIRST THING I THOUGHT, HEART RACING

THERE IN THE DARK BEDROOM, WAS THIS —

IT’S ALL RIGHT, MACHADO IS HERE.

THEN I COULD FALL BACK TO SLEEP AGAIN.

    TODAY I TOOK YOUR BOOK WITH ME WHEN I WENT

FOR MY WALK. “PAY ATTENTION!” YOU SAID,

WHEN ANYONE ASKED WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR LIVES.

SO I LOOKED AROUND AND MADE NOTE OF EVERYTHING.

THEN SAT DOWN WITH IT IN THE SUN, IN MY PLACE

BESIDE THE RIVER WHERE I COULD SEE THE MOUNTAINS.

AND I CLOSED MY EYES AND LISTENED TO THE SOUND

OF THE WATER. THEN I OPENED THEM AND BEGAN TO READ

“ABEL MARTIN’S LAST LAMENTATIONS.”

THIS MORNING I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU HARD, MACHADO.

AND I HOPE, EVEN IN THE FACE OF WHAT I KNOW ABOUT DEATH,

THAT YOU GOT THE MESSAGE I INTENDED.

BUT IT’S OKAY EVEN IF YOU DIDN’T. SLEEP WELL. REST.

SOONER OR LATER I HOPE WE’LL MEET.

AND THEN I CAN TELL YOU THESE THINGS MYSELF.

MOVEMENT
DRIVING LICKETY-SPLIT TO MAKE THE FERRY!

SNOW CREEK AND THEN DOG CREEK

FLY BY IN THE HEADLIGHTS.

BUT THE HOUR’S ALL WRONG—NO TIME TO THINK

ABOUT THE SEA-RUN TROUT THERE.

IN THE LEE OF THE MOUNTAINS

SOMETHING ON THE RADIO ABOUT AN OLD WOMAN

WHO TRAVELS AROUND INSIDE A KETTLE.

INDIGENCE IS AT THE ROOT OF OUR LIVES, YES,

BUT THIS IS NOT RIGHT.

CUT THAT OLD WOMAN SOME SLACK,

FOR GOD’S SAKE.

SHE’S SOMEBODY’S MOTHER.

YOU THERE! IT’S LATE. IMAGINE YOURSELF

WITH THE LID COMING DOWN.

THE HYMNS AND REQUIEMS. THE SENSE OF MOVEMENT

AS YOU’RE BORNE ALONG TO THE NEXT PLACE.

HOMINY AND RAIN
IN A LITTLE PATCH OF GROUND BESIDE

THE WALL OF THE EARTH SCIENCES BUILDING,

A MAN IN A CANVAS HAT WAS ON

HIS KNEES DOING SOMETHING IN THE RAIN

WITH SOME PLANTS. PIANO MUSIC

CAME FROM AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW

IN THE BUILDING NEXT DOOR. THEN

THE MUSIC STOPPED.

AND THE WINDOW WAS BROUGHT DOWN.

YOU TOLD ME THOSE WHITE BLOSSOMS

ON THE CHERRY TREES IN THE QUAD

SMELLED LIKE A CAN OF JUST-OPENED

HOMINY. HOMINY. THEY REMINDED YOU

OF THAT. THIS MAY OR MAY NOT

BE TRUE. I CAN’T SAY.

I’VE LOST MY SENSE OF SMELL,

ALONG WITH ANY INTEREST I MAY EVER

HAVE EXPRESSED IN WORKING

ON MY KNEES WITH PLANTS, OR

VEGETABLES. THERE WAS A BAREFOOT

MADMAN WITH A RING IN HIS EAR

PLAYING HIS GUITAR AND SINGING

REGGAE. I REMEMBER THAT.

RAIN PUDDLING AROUND HIS FEET.

THE PLACE HE’D PICKED TO STAND

HAD WELCOME FEAR

PAINTED ON THE SIDEWALK IN RED LETTERS.

AT THE TIME IT SEEMED IMPORTANT

TO RECALL THE MAN ON HIS KNEES

IN FRONT OF HIS PLANTS.

THE BLOSSOMS. MUSIC OF ONE KIND,

AND ANOTHER. NOW I’M NOT SO SURE.

I CAN’T SAY, FOR SURE.

IT’S A LITTLE LIKE SOME TINY CAVE-IN,

IN MY BRAIN. THERE’S A SENSE

THAT I’VE LOST—NOT EVERYTHING,

NOT EVERYTHING, BUT FAR TOO MUCH.

A PART OF MY LIFE FOREVER.

LIKE HOMINY.

 

EVEN THOUGH YOUR ARM STAYED LINKED

IN MINE. EVEN THOUGH THAT. EVEN

THOUGH WE STOOD QUIETLY IN THE

DOORWAY AS THE RAIN PICKED UP.

AND WATCHED IT WITHOUT SAYING

ANYTHING. STOOD QUIETLY.

AT PEACE, I THINK. STOOD WATCHING

THE RAIN. WHILE THE ONE

WITH THE GUITAR PLAYED ON.

THE ROAD
WHAT A ROUGH NIGHT! IT’S EITHER NO DREAMS AT ALL,

OR ELSE A DREAM THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE

A DREAM PORTENDING LOSS. LAST NIGHT I WAS DROPPED OFF

WITHOUT A WORD ON A COUNTRY ROAD.

A HOUSE BACK IN THE HILLS SHOWED A LIGHT

NO BIGGER THAN A STAR.

BUT I WAS AFRAID TO GO THERE, AND KEPT WALKING.

THEN TO WAKE UP TO RAIN STRIKING THE GLASS.

FLOWERS IN A VASE NEAR THE WINDOW.

THE SMELL OF COFFEE, AND YOU TOUCHING YOUR HAIR

WITH A GESTURE LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN GONE FOR YEARS.

BUT THERE’S A PIECE OF BREAD UNDER THE TABLE

NEAR YOUR FEET. AND A LINE OF ANTS

MOVING BACK AND FORTH FROM A CRACK IN THE FLOOR.

YOU’VE STOPPED SMILING.

DO ME A FAVOR THIS MORNING. DRAW THE CURTAIN AND COME BACK TO BED.

FORGET THE COFFEE. WE’LL PRETEND

WE’RE IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY, AND IN LOVE.

ROMANTICISM
(FOR LINDA GREGG,
AFTER READING “CLASSICISM”)

THE NIGHTS ARE VERY UNCLEAR HERE.

BUT IF THE MOON IS FULL, WE KNOW IT.

WE FEEL ONE THING ONE MINUTE,

SOMETHING ELSE THE NEXT.

THE ASHTRAY
YOU COULD WRITE A STORY ABOUT THIS

ASHTRAY, FOR EXAMPLE, AND A MAN AND A

WOMAN. BUT THE MAN AND WOMAN ARE

ALWAYS THE TWO POLES OF YOUR STORY.

THE NORTH POLE AND THE SOUTH. EVERY

STORY HAS THESE TWO POLES—HE AND SHE.

— A. P. CHEKHOV

THEY’RE ALONE AT THE KITCHEN TABLE IN HER FRIEND’S

APARTMENT. THEY’LL BE ALONE FOR ANOTHER HOUR, AND THEN

HER FRIEND WILL BE BACK. OUTSIDE, IT’S RAINING —

THE RAIN COMING DOWN LIKE NEEDLES, MELTING LAST WEEK’S

SNOW. THEY’RE SMOKING AND USING THE ASHTRAY … MAYBE

JUST ONE OF THEM IS SMOKING…HE’S SMOKING! NEVER

MIND. ANYWAY, THE ASHTRAY IS FILLING UP WITH

CIGARETTES AND ASHES.

SHE’S READY TO BREAK INTO TEARS AT ANY MINUTE.

TO PLEAD WITH HIM, IN FACT, THOUGH SHE’S PROUD

AND HAS NEVER ASKED FOR ANYTHING IN HER LIFE.

HE SEES WHAT’S COMING, RECOGNIZES THE SIGNS —

A CATCH IN HER VOICE AS SHE BRINGS HER FINGERS

TO HER LOCKET, THE ONE HER MOTHER LEFT HER.

HE PUSHES BACK HIS CHAIR, GETS UP, GOES OVER TO

THE WINDOW … HE WISHES IT WERE TOMORROW AND HE

WERE AT THE RACES. HE WISHES HE WAS OUT WALKING,

USING HIS UMBRELLA … HE STROKES HIS MUSTACHE

AND WISHES HE WERE ANYWHERE EXCEPT HERE. BUT

HE DOESN’T HAVE ANY CHOICE IN THE MATTER. HE’S GOT

TO PUT A GOOD FACE ON THIS FOR EVERYBODY’S SAKE.

GOD KNOWS, HE NEVER MEANT FOR THINGS TO COME

TO THIS. BUT IT’S SINK OR SWIM NOW. A WRONG

MOVE AND HE STANDS TO LOSE HER FRIEND, TOO.

HER BREATHING SLOWS. SHE WATCHES HIM BUT

DOESN’T SAY ANYTHING. SHE KNOWS, OR THINKS SHE

KNOWS, WHERE THIS IS LEADING. SHE PASSES A HAND

OVER HER EYES, LEANS FORWARD AND PUTS HER HEAD

IN HER HANDS. SHE’S DONE THIS A FEW TIMES

BEFORE, BUT HAS NO IDEA IT’S SOMETHING

THAT DRIVES HIM WILD. HE LOOKS AWAY AND GRINDS

HIS TEETH. HE LIGHTS A CIGARETTE, SHAKES OUT

THE MATCH, STANDS A MINUTE LONGER AT THE WINDOW.

THEN WALKS BACK TO THE TABLE AND SITS

DOWN WITH A SIGH. HE DROPS THE MATCH IN THE ASHTRAY.

SHE REACHES FOR HIS HAND, AND HE LETS HER

TAKE IT. WHY NOT? WHERE’S THE HARM?

LET HER. HIS MIND’S MADE UP. SHE COVERS HIS

FINGERS WITH KISSES, TEARS FALL ONTO HIS WRIST.

HE DRAWS ON HIS CIGARETTE AND LOOKS AT HER

AS A MAN WOULD LOOK INDIFFERENTLY ON

A CLOUD, A TREE, OR A FIELD OF OATS AT SUNSET.

HE NARROWS HIS EYES AGAINST THE SMOKE. FROM TIME

TO TIME HE USES THE ASHTRAY AS HE WAITS

FOR HER TO FINISH WEEPING.

STILL LOOKING OUT FOR
NUMBER ONE
NOW THAT YOU’VE GONE AWAY FOR FIVE DAYS,

I’LL SMOKE ALL THE CIGARETTES I WANT,

WHERE I WANT. MAKE BISCUITS AND EAT THEM

WITH JAM AND FAT BACON. LOAF. INDULGE

MYSELF. WALK ON THE BEACH IF I FEEL

LIKE IT. AND I FEEL LIKE IT, ALONE AND

THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WAS YOUNG. THE PEOPLE

THEN WHO LOVED ME BEYOND REASON.

AND HOW I LOVED THEM ABOVE ALL OTHERS.

EXCEPT ONE. I’M SAYING I’LL DO EVERYTHING

I WANT HERE WHILE YOU’RE AWAY!

BUT THERE’S ONE THING I WON’T DO.

I WON’T SLEEP IN OUR BED WITHOUT YOU.

NO. IT DOESN’T PLEASE ME TO DO SO.

I’LL SLEEP WHERE I DAMN WELL FEEL LIKE IT —

WHERE I SLEEP BEST WHEN YOU’RE AWAY

AND I CAN’T HOLD YOU THE WAY I DO.

ON THE BROKEN SOFA IN MY STUDY.

WHERE WATER COMES TOGETHER
WITH OTHER WATER
I LOVE CREEKS AND THE MUSIC THEY MAKE.

AND RILLS, IN GLADES AND MEADOWS, BEFORE

THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO BECOME CREEKS.

I MAY EVEN LOVE THEM BEST OF ALL

FOR THEIR SECRECY. I ALMOST FORGOT

TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE SOURCE!

CAN ANYTHING BE MORE WONDERFUL THAN A SPRING?

BUT THE BIG STREAMS HAVE MY HEART TOO.

AND THE PLACES STREAMS FLOW INTO RIVERS.

THE OPEN MOUTHS OF RIVERS WHERE THEY JOIN THE SEA.

THE PLACES WHERE WATER COMES TOGETHER

WITH OTHER WATER. THOSE PLACES STAND OUT

IN MY MIND LIKE HOLY PLACES.

BUT THESE COASTAL RIVERS!

I LOVE THEM THE WAY SOME MEN LOVE HORSES

OR GLAMOROUS WOMEN. I HAVE A THING

FOR THIS COLD SWIFT WATER.

JUST LOOKING AT IT MAKES MY BLOOD RUN

AND MY SKIN TINGLE. I COULD SIT

AND WATCH THESE RIVERS FOR HOURS.

NOT ONE OF THEM LIKE ANY OTHER.

I’M 45 YEARS OLD TODAY.

WOULD ANYONE BELIEVE IT IF I SAID

I WAS ONCE 35?

MY HEART EMPTY AND SERE AT 35!

FIVE MORE YEARS HAD TO PASS

BEFORE IT BEGAN TO FLOW AGAIN.

I’LL TAKE ALL THE TIME I PLEASE THIS AFTERNOON

BEFORE LEAVING MY PLACE ALONGSIDE THIS RIVER.

IT PLEASES ME, LOVING RIVERS.

LOVING THEM ALL THE WAY BACK

TO THEIR SOURCE.

LOVING EVERYTHING THAT INCREASES ME.

HAPPINESS
SO EARLY IT’S STILL ALMOST DARK OUT.

I’M NEAR THE WINDOW WITH COFFEE,

AND THE USUAL EARLY MORNING STUFF

THAT PASSES FOR THOUGHT.

WHEN I SEE THE BOY AND HIS FRIEND

WALKING UP THE ROAD

TO DELIVER THE NEWSPAPER.

THEY WEAR CAPS AND SWEATERS,

AND ONE BOY HAS A BAG OVER HIS SHOULDER.

THEY ARE SO HAPPY

THEY AREN’T SAYING ANYTHING, THESE BOYS.

I THINK IF THEY COULD, THEY WOULD TAKE

EACH OTHER’S ARM.

IT’S EARLY IN THE MORNING,

AND THEY ARE DOING THIS THING TOGETHER.

THEY COME ON, SLOWLY.

THE SKY IS TAKING ON LIGHT,

THOUGH THE MOON STILL HANGS PALE OVER THE WATER.

SUCH BEAUTY THAT FOR A MINUTE

DEATH AND AMBITION, EVEN LOVE,

DOESN’T ENTER INTO THIS.

HAPPINESS. IT COMES ON

UNEXPECTEDLY. AND GOES BEYOND, REALLY,

ANY EARLY MORNING TALK ABOUT IT.

THE OLD DAYS
YOU’D DOZED IN FRONT OF THE TV

BUT YOU HADN’T BEEN TO BED YET

WHEN YOU CALLED. I WAS ASLEEP,

OR NEARLY, WHEN THE PHONE RANG.

YOU WANTED TO TELL ME YOU’D THROWN

A PARTY. AND I WAS MISSED.

IT WAS LIKE THE OLD DAYS, YOU

SAID, AND LAUGHED.

DINNER WAS A DISASTER.

EVERYBODY DEAD DRUNK BY THE TIME

FOOD HIT THE TABLE. PEOPLE

WERE HAVING A GOOD TIME, A GREAT

TIME, A HELL OF A TIME, UNTIL

SOMEBODY TOOK SOMEBODY

ELSE’S FIANCÉE UPSTAIRS. THEN

SOMEBODY PULLED A KNIFE.

BUT YOU GOT IN FRONT OF THE GUY

AS HE WAS GOING UPSTAIRS

AND TALKED HIM DOWN.

DISASTER NARROWLY AVERTED,

YOU SAID, AND LAUGHED AGAIN.

YOU DIDN’T REMEMBER MUCH ELSE

OF WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT.

PEOPLE GOT INTO THEIR COATS

AND BEGAN TO LEAVE. YOU

MUST HAVE DROPPED OFF FOR A FEW

MINUTES IN FRONT OF THE TV

BECAUSE IT WAS SCREAMING AT YOU

TO GET IT A DRINK WHEN YOU WOKE UP.

ANYWAY, YOU’RE IN PITTSBURGH,

AND I’M IN HERE IN THIS

LITTLE TOWN ON THE OTHER SIDE

OF THE COUNTRY. MOST EVERYONE

HAS CLEARED OUT OF OUR LIVES NOW.

YOU WANTED TO CALL ME UP AND SAY HELLO.

TO SAY YOU WERE THINKING

ABOUT ME, AND OF THE OLD DAYS.

TO SAY YOU WERE MISSING ME.

IT WAS THEN I REMEMBERED

BACK TO THOSE DAYS AND HOW

TELEPHONES USED TO JUMP WHEN THEY RANG.

AND THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD COME

IN THOSE EARLY-MORNING HOURS

TO POUND ON THE DOOR IN ALARM.

NEVER MIND THE ALARM FELT INSIDE.

I REMEMBERED THAT, AND GRAVY DINNERS.

KNIVES LYING AROUND, WAITING

FOR TROUBLE. GOING TO BED

AND HOPING I WOULDN’T WAKE UP.

I LOVE YOU, BRO, YOU SAID.

AND THEN A SOB PASSED

BETWEEN US. I TOOK HOLD

OF THE RECEIVER AS IF

IT WERE MY BUDDY’S ARM.

AND I WISHED FOR US BOTH

I COULD PUT MY ARMS

AROUND YOU, OLD FRIEND.

I LOVE YOU TOO, BRO.

I SAID THAT, AND THEN WE HUNG UP.

OUR FIRST HOUSE IN SACRAMENTO
THIS MUCH IS CLEAR TO ME NOW—EVEN THEN

OUR DAYS WERE NUMBERED. AFTER OUR FIRST WEEK

IN THE HOUSE THAT CAME FURNISHED

WITH SOMEBODY ELSE’S THINGS, A MAN APPEARED

ONE NIGHT WITH A BASEBALL BAT. AND RAISED IT.

I WAS NOT THE MAN HE THOUGHT I WAS.

FINALLY, I GOT HIM TO BELIEVE IT.

HE WEPT FROM FRUSTRATION AFTER HIS ANGER

LEFT HIM. NONE OF THIS HAD ANYTHING TO DO

WITH BEATLEMANIA. THE NEXT WEEK THESE FRIENDS

OF OURS FROM THE BAR WHERE WE ALL DRANK

BROUGHT FRIENDS OF THEIRS TO OUR HOUSE —

AND WE PLAYED POKER. I LOST THE GROCERY MONEY

TO A STRANGER. WHO WENT ON TO QUARREL

WITH HIS WIFE. IN HIS FRUSTRATION

HE DROVE HIS FIST THROUGH THE KITCHEN WALL.

THEN HE, TOO, DISAPPEARED FROM MY LIFE FOREVER.

WHEN WE LEFT THAT HOUSE WHERE NOTHING WORKED

ANY LONGER, WE LEFT AT MIDNIGHT

WITH A U-HAUL TRAILER AND A LANTERN.

WHO KNOWS WHAT PASSED THROUGH THE NEIGHBORS’ MINDS

WHEN THEY SAW A FAMILY LEAVING THEIR HOUSE

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

THE LANTERN MOVING BEHIND THE CURTAINLESS

WINDOWS. THE SHADOWS GOING FROM ROOM TO ROOM,

GATHERING THEIR THINGS INTO BOXES.

I SAW FIRSTHAND

WHAT FRUSTRATION CAN DO TO A MAN.

MAKE HIM WEEP, MAKE HIM THROW HIS FIST

THROUGH A WALL. SET HIM TO DREAMING

OF THE HOUSE THAT’S HIS

AT THE END OF THE LONG ROAD. A HOUSE

FILLED WITH MUSIC, EASE, AND GENEROSITY.

A HOUSE THAT HASN’T BEEN LIVED IN YET.

NEXT YEAR
THAT FIRST WEEK IN SANTA BARBARA WASN’T THE WORST THING

TO HAPPEN. THE SECOND WEEK HE FELL ON HIS HEAD

WHILE DRINKING, JUST BEFORE HE HAD TO LECTURE.

IN THE LOUNGE, THAT SECOND WEEK, SHE TOOK THE MICROPHONE

FROM THE SINGER’S HANDS AND CROONED HER OWN

TORCH SONG. THEN DANCED. AND THEN PASSED OUT

ON THE TABLE. THAT’S NOT THE WORST, EITHER. THEY

WENT TO JAIL THAT SECOND WEEK. HE WASN’T DRIVING

SO THEY BOOKED HIM, DRESSED HIM IN PAJAMAS

AND STUCK HIM IN DETOX. TOLD HIM TO GET SOME SLEEP.

TOLD HIM HE COULD SEE ABOUT HIS WIFE IN THE MORNING.

BUT HOW COULD HE SLEEP WHEN THEY WOULDN’T LET HIM

CLOSE THE DOOR TO HIS ROOM?

THE CORRIDOR’S GREEN LIGHT ENTERED,

AND THE SOUND OF A MAN WEEPING.

HIS WIFE HAD BEEN CALLED UPON TO GIVE THE ALPHABET

BESIDE THE ROAD, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

THIS IS STRANGE ENOUGH. BUT THE COPS HAD HER

STAND ON ONE LEG, CLOSE HER EYES,

AND TRY TO TOUCH HER NOSE WITH HER INDEX FINGER.

ALL OF WHICH SHE FAILED TO DO.

SHE WENT TO JAIL FOR RESISTING ARREST.

HE BAILED HER OUT WHEN HE GOT OUT OF DETOX.

THEY DROVE HOME IN RUINS.

THIS IS NOT THE WORST. THEIR DAUGHTER HAD PICKED THAT NIGHT

TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME. SHE LEFT A NOTE:

“YOU’RE BOTH CRAZY. GIVE ME A BREAK, PLEASE.

DON’T COME AFTER ME.”

THAT’S STILL NOT THE WORST. THEY WENT ON

THINKING THEY WERE THE PEOPLE THEY SAID THEY WERE.

ANSWERING TO THOSE NAMES.

MAKING LOVE TO THE PEOPLE WITH THOSE NAMES.

NIGHTS WITHOUT BEGINNING THAT HAD NO END.

TALKING ABOUT A PAST AS IF IT’D REALLY HAPPENED.

TELLING THEMSELVES THAT THIS TIME NEXT YEAR,

THIS TIME NEXT YEAR

THINGS WERE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

TO MY DAUGHTER
EVERYTHING I SEE WILL OUTLIVE ME.

— ANNA AKHMATOVA

IT’S TOO LATE NOW TO PUT A CURSE ON YOU—WISH YOU

PLAIN, SAY, AS YEATS DID HIS DAUGHTER. AND WHEN

WE MET HER IN SLIGO, SELLING HER PAINTINGS, IT’D WORKED —

SHE WAS THE PLAINEST, OLDEST WOMAN IN IRELAND.

BUT SHE WAS SAFE.

FOR THE LONGEST TIME, HIS REASONING

ESCAPED ME. ANYWAY, IT’S TOO LATE FOR YOU,

AS I SAID. YOU’RE GROWNUP NOW, AND LOVELY.

YOU’RE A BEAUTIFUL DRUNK, DAUGHTER.

BUT YOU’RE A DRUNK. I CAN’T SAY YOU’RE BREAKING

MY HEART. I DON’T HAVE A HEART WHEN IT COMES

TO THIS BOOZE THING. SAD, YES, CHRIST ALONE KNOWS.

YOUR OLD MAN, THE ONE THEY CALL SHILOH, IS BACK

IN TOWN, AND THE DRINK HAS STARTED TO FLOW AGAIN.

YOU’VE BEEN DRUNK FOR THREE DAYS, YOU TELL ME,

WHEN YOU KNOW GODDAMN WELL DRINKING IS LIKE POISON

TO OUR FAMILY. DIDN’T YOUR MOTHER AND I SET YOU

EXAMPLE ENOUGH? TWO PEOPLE

WHO LOVED EACH OTHER KNOCKING EACH OTHER AROUND,

KNOCKING BACK THE LOVE WE FELT, GLASS BY EMPTY GLASS,

CURSES AND BLOWS AND BETRAYALS?

YOU MUST BE CRAZY! WASN’T ALL THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

YOU WANT TO DIE? MAYBE THAT’S IT. MAYBE

I THINK I KNOW YOU, AND I DON’T.

I’M NOT KIDDING, KIDDO. WHO ARE YOU KIDDING?

DAUGHTER, YOU CAN’T DRINK.

THE LAST FEW TIMES I SAW YOU, YOU WERE OUT OF IT.

A CAST ON YOUR COLLARBONE, OR ELSE

A SPLINT ON YOUR FINGER, DARK GLASSES TO HIDE

YOUR BEAUTIFUL BRUISED EYES. A LIP

THAT A MAN SHOULD KISS INSTEAD OF SPLIT.

OH, JESUS, JESUS, JESUS CHRIST!

YOU’VE GOT TO TAKE HOLD NOW.

DO YOU HEAR ME? WAKE UP! YOU’VE GOT TO KNOCK IT OFF

AND GET STRAIGHT. CLEAN UP YOUR ACT. I’M ASKING YOU.

OKAY, TELLING YOU. SURE, OUR FAMILY WAS MADE

TO SQUANDER, NOT COLLECT. BUT TURN THIS AROUND NOW.

YOU SIMPLY MUST—THAT’S ALL!

DAUGHTER, YOU CAN’T DRINK.

IT WILL KILL YOU. LIKE IT DID YOUR MOTHER, AND ME.

LIKE IT DID.

ANATHEMA
THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD SUFFERED.

MY WIFE, MYSELF, THE TWO CHILDREN, AND THE DOG

WHOSE PUPPIES WERE BORN DEAD.

OUR AFFAIRS, SUCH AS THEY WERE, WITHERED.

MY WIFE WAS DROPPED BY HER LOVER,

THE ONE-ARMED TEACHER OF MUSIC WHO WAS

HER ONLY CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD

AND THE THINGS OF THE MIND.

MY OWN GIRLFRIEND SAID SHE COULDN’T STAND IT

ANYMORE, AND WENT BACK TO HER HUSBAND.

THE WATER WAS SHUT OFF.

ALL THAT SUMMER THE HOUSE BAKED.

THE PEACH TREES WERE BLASTED.

OUR LITTLE FLOWER BED LAY TRAMPLED.

THE BRAKES WENT OUT ON THE CAR, AND THE BATTERY

FAILED. THE NEIGHBORS QUIT SPEAKING

TO US AND CLOSED THEIR DOORS IN OUR FACES.

CHECKS FLEW BACK AT US FROM MERCHANTS —

AND THEN MAIL STOPPED BEING DELIVERED

ALTOGETHER. ONLY THE SHERIFF GOT THROUGH

FROM TIME TO TIME—WITH ONE OR THE OTHER

OF OUR CHILDREN IN THE BACK SEAT,

PLEADING TO BE TAKEN ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

AND THEN MICE ENTERED THE HOUSE IN DROVES.

FOLLOWED BY A BULL SNAKE. MY WIFE

FOUND IT SUNNING ITSELF IN THE LIVING ROOM

NEXT TO THE DEAD TV. HOW SHE DEALT WITH IT

IS ANOTHER MATTER. CHOPPED ITS HEAD OFF

RIGHT THERE ON THE FLOOR.

AND THEN CHOPPED IT IN TWO WHEN IT CONTINUED

TO WRITHE. WE SAW WE COULDN’T HOLD OUT

ANY LONGER. WE WERE BEATEN.

WE WANTED TO GET DOWN ON OUR KNEES

AND SAY FORGIVE US OUR SINS, FORGIVE US

OUR LIVES. BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

TOO LATE. NO ONE AROUND WOULD LISTEN.

WE HAD TO WATCH AS THE HOUSE WAS PULLED DOWN,

THE GROUND PLOWED UP, AND THEN

WE WERE DISPERSED IN FOUR DIRECTIONS.

ENERGY
LAST NIGHT AT MY DAUGHTER’S, NEAR BLAINE,

SHE DID HER BEST TO TELL ME

WHAT WENT WRONG

BETWEEN HER MOTHER AND ME.

“ENERGY. YOU TWO’S ENERGY WAS ALL WRONG.”

SHE LOOKS LIKE HER MOTHER

WHEN HER MOTHER WAS YOUNG.

LAUGHS LIKE HER.

MOVES THE DRIFT OF HAIR

FROM HER FOREHEAD, LIKE HER MOTHER.

CAN TAKE A CIGARETTE DOWN

TO THE FILTER IN THREE DRAWS,

JUST LIKE HER MOTHER. I THOUGHT

THIS VISIT WOULD BE EASY. WRONG.

THIS IS HARD, BROTHER. THOSE YEARS

SPILLING OVER INTO MY SLEEP WHEN I TRY

TO SLEEP. TO WAKE TO FIND A THOUSAND

CIGARETTES IN THE ASHTRAY AND EVERY

LIGHT IN THE HOUSE BURNING. I CAN’T

PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING:

TODAY I’LL BE CARRIED

THREE THOUSAND MILES AWAY INTO

THE LOVING ARMS OF ANOTHER WOMAN, NOT

HER MOTHER. NO. SHE’S CAUGHT

IN THE FLYWHEEL OF A NEW LOVE.

I TURN OFF THE LAST LIGHT

AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

MOVING TOWARD WHATEVER ANCIENT THING

IT IS THAT WORKS THE CHAINS

AND PULLS US SO RELENTLESSLY ON.

LOCKING YOURSELF OUT,
THEN TRYING TO GET BACK IN
YOU SIMPLY GO OUT AND SHUT THE DOOR

WITHOUT THINKING. AND WHEN YOU LOOK BACK

AT WHAT YOU’VE DONE

IT’S TOO LATE. IF THIS SOUNDS

LIKE THE STORY OF A LIFE, OKAY.

IT WAS RAINING. THE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD

A KEY WERE AWAY. I TRIED AND TRIED

THE LOWER WINDOWS. STARED

INSIDE AT THE SOFA, PLANTS, THE TABLE

AND CHAIRS, THE STEREO SET-UP.

MY COFFEE CUP AND ASHTRAY WAITED FOR ME

ON THE GLASS-TOPPED TABLE, AND MY HEART

WENT OUT TO THEM. I SAID, HELLO, FRIENDS,

OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AFTER ALL,

THIS WASN’T SO BAD.

WORSE THINGS HAD HAPPENED. THIS

WAS EVEN A LITTLE FUNNY. I FOUND THE LADDER.

TOOK THAT AND LEANED IT AGAINST THE HOUSE.

THEN CLIMBED IN THE RAIN TO THE DECK,

SWUNG MYSELF OVER THE RAILING

AND TRIED THE DOOR. WHICH WAS LOCKED,

OF COURSE. BUT I LOOKED IN JUST THE SAME

AT MY DESK, SOME PAPERS, AND MY CHAIR.

THIS WAS THE WINDOW ON THE OTHER SIDE

OF THE DESK WHERE I’D RAISE MY EYES

AND STARE OUT WHEN I SAT AT THAT DESK.

THIS IS NOT LIKE DOWNSTAIRS, I THOUGHT.

THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE.

AND IT WAS SOMETHING TO LOOK IN LIKE THAT, UNSEEN,

FROM THE DECK. TO BE THERE, INSIDE, AND NOT BE THERE.

I DON’T EVEN THINK I CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

I BROUGHT MY FACE CLOSE TO THE GLASS

AND IMAGINED MYSELF INSIDE,

SITTING AT THE DESK. LOOKING UP

FROM MY WORK NOW AND AGAIN.

THINKING ABOUT SOME OTHER PLACE

AND SOME OTHER TIME.

THE PEOPLE I HAD LOVED THEN.

I STOOD THERE FOR A MINUTE IN THE RAIN.

CONSIDERING MYSELF TO BE THE LUCKIEST OF MEN.

EVEN THOUGH A WAVE OF GRIEF PASSED THROUGH ME.

EVEN THOUGH I FELT VIOLENTLY ASHAMED

OF THE INJURY I’D DONE BACK THEN.

I BASHED THAT BEAUTIFUL WINDOW.

AND STEPPED BACK IN.

MEDICINE
ALL I KNOW ABOUT MEDICINE I PICKED UP

FROM MY DOCTOR FRIEND IN EL PASO

WHO DRANK AND TOOK DRUGS. WE WERE BUDDIES

UNTIL I MOVED EAST. I’M SAYING

I WAS NEVER SICK A DAY IN MY LIFE.

BUT SOMETHING HAS APPEARED

ON MY SHOULDER AND CONTINUES TO GROW.

A WEN, I THINK, AND LOVE THE WORD

BUT NOT THE THING ITSELF, WHATEVER

IT IS. LATE AT NIGHT MY TEETH ACHE

AND THE PHONE RINGS. I’M ILL,

UNHAPPY AND ALONE. LORD!

GIVE ME YOUR UNSTEADY KNIFE,

DOC. GIVE ME YOUR HAND, FRIEND.

WENAS RIDGE
THE SEASONS TURNING. MEMORY FLARING.

THREE OF US THAT FALL. YOUNG HOODLUMS —

SHOPLIFTERS, STEALERS OF HUBCAPS.

BOZOS. DICK MILLER, DEAD NOW.

LYLE ROUSSEAU, SON OF THE FORD DEALER.

AND I, WHO’D JUST MADE A GIRL PREGNANT.

HUNTING LATE INTO THAT GOLDEN AFTERNOON

FOR GROUSE. FOLLOWING DEER PATHS,

PUSHING THROUGH UNDERGROWTH, STEPPING OVER

BLOW-DOWNS. REACHING OUT FOR SOMETHING TO HOLD ONTO.

AT THE TOP OF WENAS RIDGE

WE WALKED OUT OF PINE TREES AND COULD SEE

DOWN DEEP RAVINES, WHERE THE WIND ROARED, TO THE RIVER.

MORE ALIVE THEN, I THOUGHT, THAN I’D EVER BE.

BUT MY WHOLE LIFE, IN SWITCHBACKS, AHEAD OF ME.

HAWKS, DEER, COONS WE LOOKED AT AND LET GO.

KILLED SIX GROUSE AND SHOULD HAVE STOPPED.

DIDN’T, THOUGH WE HAD LIMITS.

LYLE AND I CLIMBING FIFTY FEET OR SO

ABOVE DICK MILLER. WHO SCREAMED—“YAAAAH!”

THEN SWORE AND SWORE. LEGS NUMBING AS I SAW WHAT.

THAT FAT, DARK SNAKE RISING UP. BEGINNING TO SING.

AND HOW IT SANG! A TIMBER RATTLER THICK AS MY WRIST.

IT’D STRUCK AT MILLER, BUT MISSED. NO OTHER WAY

TO SAY IT—HE WAS PARALYZED. COULD SCREAM, AND SWEAR,

NOT SHOOT. THEN THE SNAKE LOWERED ITSELF FROM SIGHT

AND WENT IN UNDER ROCKS. WE UNDERSTOOD

WE’D HAVE TO GET DOWN. IN THE SAME WAY WE’D GOT UP.

BLINDLY CRAWLING THROUGH BRUSH, STEPPING OVER BLOW-DOWNS,

PUSHING INTO UNDERGROWTH. SHADOWS FALLING FROM TREES NOW

ONTO FLAT ROCKS THAT HELD THE DAY’S HEAT. AND SNAKES.

MY HEART STOPPED, AND THEN STARTED AGAIN.

MY HAIR STOOD ON END. THIS WAS THE MOMENT

MY LIFE HAD PREPARED ME FOR. AND I WASN’T READY.

WE STARTED DOWN ANYWAY. JESUS, PLEASE HELP ME

OUT OF THIS, I PRAYED. I’LL BELIEVE IN YOU AGAIN

AND HONOR YOU ALWAYS. BUT JESUS WAS CROWDED OUT

OF MY HEAD BY THE VISION OF THAT REARING SNAKE.

THAT SINGING. KEEP BELIEVING IN ME, SNAKE SAID,

FOR I WILL RETURN. I MADE AN OBSCURE, CRIMINAL PACT

THAT DAY. PRAYING TO JESUS IN ONE BREATH.

TO SNAKE IN THE OTHER. SNAKE FINALLY MORE REAL

TO ME. THE MEMORY OF THAT DAY

LIKE A BLOW TO THE CALF NOW.

I GOT OUT, DIDN’T I? BUT SOMETHING HAPPENED.

I MARRIED THE GIRL I LOVED, YET POISONED HER LIFE.

LIES BEGAN TO COIL IN MY HEART AND CALL IT HOME.

GOT USED TO DARKNESS AND ITS CROOKED WAYS.

SINCE THEN I’VE ALWAYS FEARED RATTLESNAKES.

BEEN AMBIVALENT ABOUT JESUS.

BUT SOMEONE, SOMETHING’S RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

NOW, AS THEN.

READING
EVERY MAN’S LIFE IS A MYSTERY, EVEN AS

YOURS IS, AND MINE. IMAGINE

A CHÂTEAU WITH A WINDOW OPENING

ONTO LAKE GENEVA. THERE IN THE WINDOW

ON WARM AND SUNNY DAYS IS A MAN

SO ENGROSSED IN READING HE DOESN’T LOOK

UP. OR IF HE DOES HE MARKS HIS PLACE

WITH A FINGER, RAISES HIS EYES, AND PEERS

ACROSS THE WATER TO MONT BLANC,

AND BEYOND, TO SELAH, WASHINGTON,

WHERE HE IS WITH A GIRL

AND GETTING DRUNK FOR THE FIRST TIME.

THE LAST THING HE REMEMBERS, BEFORE

HE PASSES OUT, IS THAT SHE SPIT ON HIM.

HE KEEPS ON DRINKING

AND GETTING SPIT ON FOR YEARS.

BUT SOME PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU

THAT SUFFERING IS GOOD FOR THE CHARACTER.

YOU’RE FREE TO BELIEVE ANYTHING.

IN ANY CASE, HE GOES

BACK TO READING AND WILL NOT

FEEL GUILTY ABOUT HIS MOTHER

DRIFTING IN HER BOAT OF SADNESS,

OR CONSIDER HIS CHILDREN

AND THEIR TROUBLES THAT GO ON AND ON.

NOR DOES HE INTEND TO THINK ABOUT

THE CLEAR-EYED WOMAN HE ONCE LOVED

AND HER DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF EASTERN RELIGION.

HER GRIEF HAS NO BEGINNING, AND NO END.

LET ANYONE IN THE CHÂTEAU, OR SELAH,

COME FORWARD WHO MIGHT CLAIM KIN WITH THE MAN

WHO SITS ALL DAY IN THE WINDOW READING,

LIKE A PICTURE OF A MAN READING.

LET THE SUN COME FORWARD.

LET THE MAN HIMSELF COME FORWARD.

WHAT IN HELL CAN HE BE READING?

RAIN
WOKE UP THIS MORNING WITH

A TERRIFIC URGE TO LIE IN BED ALL DAY

AND READ. FOUGHT AGAINST IT FOR A MINUTE.

THEN LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW AT THE RAIN.

AND GAVE OVER. PUT MYSELF ENTIRELY

IN THE KEEP OF THIS RAINY MORNING.

WOULD I LIVE MY LIFE OVER AGAIN?

MAKE THE SAME UNFORGIVABLE MISTAKES?

YES, GIVEN HALF A CHANCE. YES.

MONEY
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LIVE

ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAW.

TO ALWAYS USE HIS OWN NAME

AND PHONE NUMBER. TO GO BAIL

FOR A FRIEND AND NOT GIVE

A DAMN IF THE FRIEND SKIPS TOWN.

HOPE, IN FACT, SHE DOES.

TO GIVE SOME MONEY

TO HIS MOTHER. AND TO HIS

CHILDREN AND THEIR MOTHER.

NOT SAVE IT. HE WANTS

TO USE IT UP BEFORE IT’S GONE.

BUY CLOTHES WITH IT.

PAY THE RENT AND UTILITIES.

BUY FOOD, AND THEN SOME.

GO OUT FOR DINNER WHEN HE FEELS LIKE IT.

AND IT’S OKAY

TO ORDER ANYTHING OFF THE MENU!

BUY DRUGS WHEN HE WANTS.

BUY A CAR. IF IT BREAKS

DOWN, REPAIR IT. OR ELSE

BUY ANOTHER. SEE THAT

BOAT? HE MIGHT BUY ONE

JUST LIKE IT. AND SAIL IT

AROUND THE HORN, LOOKING

FOR COMPANY. HE KNOWS A GIRL

IN PORTO ALEGRE WHO’D LOVE

TO SEE HIM IN

HIS OWN BOAT, SAILS FULL,

TURN INTO THE HARBOR FOR HER.

A FELLOW WHO COULD AFFORD

TO COME ALL THIS WAY

TO SEE HER. JUST BECAUSE

HE LIKED THE SOUND

OF HER LAUGHTER,

AND THE WAY SHE SWINGS HER HAIR.

ASPENS
IMAGINE A YOUNG MAN, ALONE, WITHOUT ANYONE.

THE MOMENT A FEW RAINDROPS STREAKED HIS GLASS

HE BEGAN TO SCRIBBLE.

HE LIVED IN A TENEMENT WITH MICE FOR COMPANY.

I LOVED HIS BRAVERY.

SOMEONE ELSE A FEW DOORS DOWN

PLAYED SEGOVIA RECORDS ALL DAY.

HE NEVER LEFT HIS ROOM, AND NO ONE COULD BLAME HIM.

AT NIGHT HE COULD HEAR THE OTHER’S

TYPEWRITER GOING, AND FEEL COMFORTED.

LITERATURE AND MUSIC.

EVERYONE DREAMING OF SPANISH HORSEMEN

AND COURTYARDS.

PROCESSIONS. CEREMONY, AND

RESPLENDENCE.

ASPEN TREES.

DAYS OF RAIN AND HIGH WATER.

LEAVES HAMMERED INTO THE GROUND FINALLY.

IN MY HEART, THIS PLOT OF EARTH

THAT THE STORM LIGHTS.

AT LEAST
I WANT TO GET UP EARLY ONE MORE MORNING,

BEFORE SUNRISE. BEFORE THE BIRDS, EVEN.

I WANT TO THROW COLD WATER ON MY FACE

AND BE AT MY WORK TABLE

WHEN THE SKY LIGHTENS AND SMOKE

BEGINS TO RISE FROM THE CHIMNEYS

OF THE OTHER HOUSES.

I WANT TO SEE THE WAVES BREAK

ON THIS ROCKY BEACH, NOT JUST HEAR THEM

BREAK AS I DID ALL NIGHT IN MY SLEEP.

I WANT TO SEE AGAIN THE SHIPS

THAT PASS THROUGH THE STRAIT FROM EVERY

SEAFARING COUNTRY IN THE WORLD —

OLD, DIRTY FREIGHTERS JUST BARELY MOVING ALONG,

AND THE SWIFT NEW CARGO VESSELS

PAINTED EVERY COLOR UNDER THE SUN

THAT CUT THE WATER AS THEY PASS.

I WANT TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR THEM.

AND FOR THE LITTLE BOAT THAT PLIES

THE WATER BETWEEN THE SHIPS

AND THE PILOT STATION NEAR THE LIGHTHOUSE.

I WANT TO SEE THEM TAKE A MAN OFF THE SHIP

AND PUT ANOTHER UP ON BOARD.

I WANT TO SPEND THE DAY WATCHING THIS HAPPEN

AND REACH MY OWN CONCLUSIONS.

I HATE TO SEEM GREEDY—I HAVE SO MUCH

TO BE THANKFUL FOR ALREADY.

BUT I WANT TO GET UP EARLY ONE MORE MORNING, AT LEAST.

AND GO TO MY PLACE WITH SOME COFFEE AND WAIT.

JUST WAIT, TO SEE WHAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN.

THE GRANT
IT’S EITHER THIS OR BOBCAT HUNTING

WITH MY FRIEND MORRIS.

TRYING TO WRITE A POEM AT SIX THIS

MORNING, OR ELSE RUNNING

BEHIND THE HOUNDS WITH

A RIFLE IN MY HANDS.

HEART JUMPING IN ITS CAGE.

I’M 45 YEARS OLD. NO OCCUPATION.

IMAGINE THE LUXURIOUSNESS OF THIS LIFE.

TRY AND IMAGINE.

MAY GO WITH HIM IF HE GOES

TOMORROW. BUT MAY NOT.

MY BOAT
MY BOAT IS BEING MADE TO ORDER. RIGHT NOW IT’S ABOUT TO LEAVE

THE HANDS OF ITS BUILDERS. I’VE RESERVED A SPECIAL PLACE

FOR IT DOWN AT THE MARINA. IT’S GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF ROOM

ON IT FOR ALL MY FRIENDS: RICHARD, BILL, CHUCK, TOBY, JIM, HAYDEN,

GARY, GEORGE, HAROLD, DON, DICK, SCOTT, GEOFFREY, JACK,

PAUL, JAY, MORRIS, AND ALFREDO. ALL MY FRIENDS! THEY KNOW WHO

THEY ARE.

TESS, OF COURSE. I WOULDN’T GO ANYPLACE WITHOUT HER.

AND KRISTINA, MERRY, CATHERINE, DIANE, SALLY, ANNICK, PAT,

JUDITH, SUSIE, LYNNE, ANNIE, JANE, MONA.

DOUG AND AMY! THEY’RE FAMILY, BUT THEY’RE ALSO MY FRIENDS,

AND THEY LIKE A GOOD TIME. THERE’S ROOM ON MY BOAT

FOR JUST ABOUT EVERYONE. I’M SERIOUS ABOUT THIS!

THERE’LL BE A PLACE ON BOARD FOR EVERYONE’S STORIES.

MY OWN, BUT ALSO THE ONES BELONGING TO MY FRIENDS.

SHORT STORIES, AND THE ONES THAT GO ON AND ON. THE TRUE

AND THE MADE-UP. THE ONES ALREADY FINISHED, AND THE ONES STILL

BEING WRITTEN.

POEMS, TOO! LYRIC POEMS, AND THE LONGER, DARKER NARRATIVES.

FOR MY PAINTER FRIENDS, PAINTS AND CANVASES WILL BE ON BOARD

MY BOAT.

WE’LL HAVE FRIED CHICKEN, LUNCH MEATS, CHEESES, ROLLS,

FRENCH BREAD. EVERY GOOD THING THAT MY FRIENDS AND I LIKE.

AND A BIG BASKET OF FRUIT, IN CASE ANYONE WANTS FRUIT.

IN CASE ANYONE WANTS TO SAY HE OR SHE ATE AN APPLE,

OR SOME GRAPES, ON MY BOAT. WHATEVER MY FRIENDS WANT,

NAME IT, AND IT’LL BE THERE. SODA POP OF ALL KINDS.

BEER AND WINE, SURE. NO ONE WILL BE DENIED ANYTHING, ON

MY BOAT.

WE’LL GO OUT INTO THE SUNNY HARBOR AND HAVE FUN, THAT’S THE IDEA.

JUST HAVE A GOOD TIME ALL AROUND. NOT THINKING

ABOUT THIS OR THAT OR GETTING AHEAD OR FALLING BEHIND.

FISHING POLES IF ANYONE WANTS TO FISH. THE FISH ARE OUT THERE!

WE MAY EVEN GO A LITTLE WAY DOWN THE COAST, ON MY BOAT.

BUT NOTHING DANGEROUS, NOTHING TOO SERIOUS.

THE IDEA IS SIMPLY TO ENJOY OURSELVES AND NOT GET SCARED.

WE’LL EAT AND DRINK AND LAUGH A LOT, ON MY BOAT.

I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO TAKE AT LEAST ONE TRIP LIKE THIS,

WITH MY FRIENDS, ON MY BOAT. IF WE WANT TO

WE’LL LISTEN TO SCHUMANN ON THE CBC.

BUT IF THAT DOESN’T WORK OUT, OKAY,

WE’LL SWITCH TO KRAB, THE WHO, AND THE ROLLING STONES.

WHATEVER MAKES MY FRIENDS HAPPY! MAYBE EVERYONE

WILL HAVE THEIR OWN RADIO, ON MY BOAT. IN ANY CASE,

WE’RE GOING TO HAVE A BIG TIME. PEOPLE ARE GOING TO HAVE FUN,

AND DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO, ON MY BOAT.

THE POEM I DIDN’T WRITE
HERE IS THE POEM I WAS GOING TO WRITE

EARLIER, BUT DIDN’T

BECAUSE I HEARD YOU STIRRING.

I WAS THINKING AGAIN

ABOUT THAT FIRST MORNING IN ZURICH.

HOW WE WOKE UP BEFORE SUNRISE.

DISORIENTED FOR A MINUTE. BUT GOING

OUT ONTO THE BALCONY THAT LOOKED DOWN

OVER THE RIVER, AND THE OLD PART OF THE CITY.

AND SIMPLY STANDING THERE, SPEECHLESS.

NUDE. WATCHING THE SKY LIGHTEN.

SO THRILLED AND HAPPY. AS IF

WE’D BEEN PUT THERE

JUST AT THAT MOMENT.

WORK
FOR JOHN GARDNER, D. SEPTEMBER 14, 1982

LOVE OF WORK. THE BLOOD SINGING

IN THAT. THE FINE HIGH RISE

OF IT INTO THE WORK. A MAN SAYS,

I’M WORKING. OR, I WORKED TODAY.

OR, I’M TRYING TO MAKE IT WORK.

HIM WORKING SEVEN DAYS A WEEK.

AND BEING AWAKENED IN THE MORNING

BY HIS YOUNG WIFE, HIS HEAD ON THE TYPEWRITER.

THE FULLNESS BEFORE WORK.

THE AMAZED UNDERSTANDING AFTER.

FASTENING HIS HELMET.

CLIMBING ONTO HIS MOTORCYCLE

AND THINKING ABOUT HOME.

AND WORK. YES, WORK. THE GOING

TO WHAT LASTS.

IN THE YEAR 2020
WHICH OF US WILL BE LEFT THEN —

OLD, DAZED, UNCLEAR —

BUT WILLING TO TALK ABOUT OUR DEAD FRIENDS?

TALK AND TALK, LIKE AN OLD FAUCET LEAKING.

SO THAT THE YOUNG ONES,

RESPECTFUL, TOUCHINGLY CURIOUS,

WILL FIND THEMSELVES STIRRED

BY THE RECOLLECTIONS.

BY THE VERY MENTION OF THIS NAME

OR THAT NAME, AND WHAT WE DID TOGETHER.

(AS WE WERE RESPECTFUL, BUT CURIOUS

AND EXCITED, TO HEAR SOMEONE TELL

ABOUT THE ILLUSTRIOUS DEAD AHEAD OF US.)

OF WHICH OF US WILL THEY SAY

TO THEIR FRIENDS,

HE KNEW SO AND SO! HE WAS FRIENDS WITH_____

AND THEY SPENT TIME TOGETHER.

HE WAS AT THAT BIG PARTY.

EVERYONE WAS THERE. THEY CELEBRATED

AND DANCED UNTIL DAWN. THEY PUT THEIR ARMS

AROUND EACH OTHER AND DANCED

UNTIL THE SUN CAME UP.

NOW THEY’RE ALL GONE.

OF WHICH OF US WILL IT BE SAID —

HE KNEW THEM? SHOOK HANDS WITH THEM

AND EMBRACED THEM, STAYED OVERNIGHT

IN THEIR WARM HOUSES. LOVED THEM!

FRIENDS, I DO LOVE YOU, IT’S TRUE.

AND I HOPE I’M LUCKY ENOUGH, PRIVILEGED ENOUGH,

TO LIVE ON AND BEAR WITNESS.

BELIEVE ME, I’LL SAY ONLY THE MOST

GLORIOUS THINGS ABOUT YOU AND OUR TIME HERE!

FOR THE SURVIVOR THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING

TO LOOK FORWARD TO. GROWING OLD,

LOSING EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY.

THE JUGGLER AT HEAVEN’S GATE
FOR MICHAEL CIMINO

BEHIND THE DIRTY TABLE WHERE KRISTOFFERSON IS HAVING

BREAKFAST, THERE’S A WINDOW THAT LOOKS ONTO A NINETEENTH-CENTURY

STREET IN SWEETWATER, WYOMING. A JUGGLER

IS AT WORK OUT THERE, WEARING A TOP HAT AND A FROCK COAT,

A LITTLE REED OF A FELLOW KEEPING THREE STICKS

IN THE AIR. THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE.

THIS JUGGLER. THIS AMAZING ACT OF THE MIND AND HANDS.

A MAN WHO JUGGLES FOR A LIVING.

EVERYONE IN HIS TIME HAS KNOWN A STAR,

OR A GUNFIGHTER. SOMEBODY, ANYWAY, WHO PUSHES SOMEBODY

AROUND. BUT A JUGGLER! BLUE SMOKE HANGS INSIDE

THIS AWFUL CAFÉ, AND OVER THAT DIRTY TABLE WHERE TWO

GROWNUP MEN TALK ABOUT A WOMAN’S FUTURE. AND SOMETHING,

SOMETHING ABOUT THE CATTLEMEN’S ASSOCIATION.

BUT THE EYE KEEPS GOING BACK TO THAT JUGGLER.

THAT TINY SPECTACLE. AT THIS MINUTE, ELLA’S PLIGHT

OR THE FATE OF THE EMIGRANTS

IS NOT NEARLY SO IMPORTANT AS THIS JUGGLER’S EXPLOITS.

HOW’D HE GET INTO THE ACT, ANYWAY? WHAT’S HIS STORY?

THAT’S THE STORY I WANT TO KNOW. ANYBODY

CAN WEAR A GUN AND SWAGGER AROUND. OR FALL IN LOVE

WITH SOMEBODY WHO LOVES SOMEBODY ELSE. BUT TO JUGGLE

FOR GOD’S SAKE! TO GIVE YOUR LIFE TO THAT.

TO GO WITH THAT. JUGGLING.

MY DAUGHTER AND APPLE PIE
SHE SERVES ME A PIECE OF IT A FEW MINUTES

OUT OF THE OVEN. A LITTLE STEAM RISES

FROM THE SLITS ON TOP. SUGAR AND SPICE —

CINNAMON—BURNED INTO THE CRUST.

BUT SHE’S WEARING THESE DARK GLASSES

IN THE KITCHEN AT TEN O’CLOCK

IN THE MORNING—EVERYTHING NICE —

AS SHE WATCHES ME BREAK OFF

A PIECE, BRING IT TO MY MOUTH,

AND BLOW ON IT. MY DAUGHTER’S KITCHEN,

IN WINTER. I FORK THE PIE IN

AND TELL MYSELF TO STAY OUT OF IT.

SHE SAYS SHE LOVES HIM. NO WAY

COULD IT BE WORSE.

COMMERCE
A SWANK DINNER. FOOD TRULY WONDERFUL

AND PLENTY OF IT. IT WAS THE WAY I ALWAYS DREAMED

IT WOULD BE. AND IT JUST KEPT COMING

WHILE WE TALKED ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE.

EVEN WHEN WE WEREN’T TALKING ABOUT IT,

IT WAS THERE—IN THE OYSTERS, THE LAMB,

THE SAUCES, THE FINE WHITE LINEN, THE CUTLERY

AND GOBLETS. IT SAID, HERE IS YOUR LIFE, ENJOY.

THIS IS THE POEM I WANTED TO LIVE TO WRITE! THEN

TO COME UPON THE SPIRIT IN A FLAMING DESSERT —

THE STREAKS OF FIRE SHOOTING UP, ONLY TO DROP

BACK, AS IF EXHAUSTED.

DRIVING HOME AFTERWARDS, MY HEAD ASWIM

FROM OVEREATING. WHAT A SWINE! I DESERVE

EVERYTHING THAT FELLOW’S GOING TO SAY ABOUT ME.

FALLING ASLEEP IN MY PANTS ON TOP OF THE COVERS.

BUT NOT BEFORE THINKING ABOUT WOLVES,

A SULTRY DAY IN THE WOODS.

MY LIFE STAKED DOWN IN THE CLEARING.

WHEN I TRY TO TURN MY HEAD TO REVEAL

THE FLESHY NECK, I CAN’T MOVE.

I DON’T HAVE THE ENERGY. LET THEM GO

FOR THE BELLY, THOSE BROTHER WOLVES

WITH THE BURNING EYES.

TO HAVE COME THIS FAR IN A SINGLE NIGHT!

BUT THEN I NEVER KNEW WHEN TO STOP.

THE FISHING POLE OF THE DROWNED MAN
I DIDN’T WANT TO USE IT AT FIRST.

THEN I THOUGHT, NO, IT WOULD

GIVE UP SECRETS AND BRING ME LUCK —

THAT’S WHAT I NEEDED THEN.

BESIDES, HE’D LEFT IT BEHIND FOR ME

TO USE WHEN HE WENT SWIMMING THAT TIME.

SHORTLY AFTERWARDS, I MET TWO WOMEN.

ONE OF THEM LOVED OPERA AND THE OTHER

WAS A DRUNK WHO’D DONE TIME

IN JAIL. I TOOK UP WITH ONE

AND BEGAN TO DRINK AND FIGHT A LOT.

THE WAY THIS WOMAN COULD SING AND CARRY ON!

WE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM.

A WALK
I TOOK A WALK ON THE RAILROAD TRACK.

FOLLOWED THAT FOR A WHILE

AND GOT OFF AT THE COUNTRY GRAVEYARD

WHERE A MAN SLEEPS BETWEEN

TWO WIVES. EMILY VAN DER ZEE,

LOVING WIFE AND MOTHER,

IS AT JOHN VAN DER ZEE’S RIGHT.

MARY, THE SECOND MRS VAN DER ZEE,

ALSO A LOVING WIFE, TO HIS LEFT.

FIRST EMILY WENT, THEN MARY.

AFTER A FEW YEARS, THE OLD FELLOW HIMSELF.

ELEVEN CHILDREN CAME FROM THESE UNIONS.

AND THEY, TOO, WOULD ALL HAVE TO BE DEAD NOW.

THIS IS A QUIET PLACE. AS GOOD A PLACE AS ANY

TO BREAK MY WALK, SIT, AND PROVIDE AGAINST

MY OWN DEATH, WHICH COMES ON.

BUT I DON’T UNDERSTAND, AND I DON’T UNDERSTAND.

ALL I KNOW ABOUT THIS FINE, SWEATY LIFE,

MY OWN OR ANYONE ELSE’S,

IS THAT IN A LITTLE WHILE I’LL RISE UP

AND LEAVE THIS ASTONISHING PLACE

THAT GIVES SHELTER TO DEAD PEOPLE. THIS GRAVEYARD.

AND GO. WALKING FIRST ON ONE RAIL

AND THEN THE OTHER.

MY DAD’S WALLET
LONG BEFORE HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN DEATH,

MY DAD SAID HE WANTED TO LIE CLOSE

TO HIS PARENTS. HE MISSED THEM SO

AFTER THEY WENT AWAY.

HE SAID THIS ENOUGH THAT MY MOTHER REMEMBERED,

AND I REMEMBERED. BUT WHEN THE BREATH

LEFT HIS LUNGS AND ALL SIGNS OF LIFE

HAD FADED, HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A TOWN

512 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE HE WANTED MOST TO BE.

MY DAD, THOUGH. HE WAS RESTLESS

EVEN IN DEATH. EVEN IN DEATH

HE HAD THIS ONE LAST TRIP TO TAKE.

ALL HIS LIFE HE LIKED TO WANDER,

AND NOW HE HAD ONE MORE PLACE TO GET TO.

THE UNDERTAKER SAID HE’D ARRANGE IT,

NOT TO WORRY. SOME POOR LIGHT

FROM THE WINDOW FELL ON THE DUSTY FLOOR

WHERE WE WAITED THAT AFTERNOON

UNTIL THE MAN CAME OUT OF THE BACK ROOM

AND PEELED OFF HIS RUBBER GLOVES.

HE CARRIED THE SMELL OF FORMALDEHYDE WITH HIM.

HE WAS A BIG MAN, THIS UNDERTAKER SAID.

THEN BEGAN TO TELL US WHY

HE LIKED LIVING IN THIS SMALL TOWN.

THIS MAN WHO’D JUST OPENED MY DAD’S VEINS.

HOW MUCH IS IT GOING TO COST? I SAID.

HE TOOK OUT HIS PAD AND PEN AND BEGAN

TO WRITE. FIRST, THE PREPARATION CHARGES.

THEN HE FIGURED THE TRANSPORTATION

OF THE REMAINS AT 22 CENTS A MILE.

BUT THIS WAS A ROUND-TRIP FOR THE UNDERTAKER,

DON’T FORGET. PLUS, SAY, SIX MEALS

AND TWO NIGHTS IN A MOTEL. HE FIGURED

SOME MORE. ADD A SURCHARGE OF

$210 FOR HIS TIME AND TROUBLE,

AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

HE THOUGHT WE MIGHT ARGUE.

THERE WAS A SPOT OF COLOR ON

EACH OF HIS CHEEKS AS HE LOOKED UP

FROM HIS FIGURES. THE SAME POOR LIGHT

FELL IN THE SAME POOR PLACE ON

THE DUSTY FLOOR. MY MOTHER NODDED

AS IF SHE UNDERSTOOD. BUT SHE

HADN’T UNDERSTOOD A WORD OF IT.

NONE OF IT HAD MADE ANY SENSE TO HER,

BEGINNING WITH THE TIME SHE LEFT HOME

WITH MY DAD. SHE ONLY KNEW

THAT WHATEVER WAS HAPPENING

WAS GOING TO TAKE MONEY.

SHE REACHED INTO HER PURSE AND BROUGHT UP

MY DAD’S WALLET. THE THREE OF US

IN THAT LITTLE ROOM THAT AFTERNOON.

OUR BREATH COMING AND GOING.

WE STARED AT THE WALLET FOR A MINUTE.

NOBODY SAID ANYTHING.

ALL THE LIFE HAD GONE OUT OF THAT WALLET.

IT WAS OLD AND RENT AND SOILED.

BUT IT WAS MY DAD’S WALLET. AND SHE OPENED

IT AND LOOKED INSIDE. DREW OUT

A HANDFUL OF MONEY THAT WOULD GO

TOWARD THIS LAST, MOST ASTOUNDING, TRIP.

ASK HIM
RELUCTANTLY, MY SON GOES WITH ME

THROUGH THE IRON GATES

OF THE CEMETERY IN MONTPARNASSE.

“WHAT A WAY TO SPEND A DAY IN PARIS!”

IS WHAT HE’D LIKE TO SAY. DID, IN FACT, SAY.

HE SPEAKS FRENCH. HAS STARTED A CONVERSATION

WITH A WHITE-HAIRED GUARD WHO OFFERS HIMSELF

AS OUR INFORMAL GUIDE. SO WE MOVE SLOWLY,

THE THREE OF US, ALONG ROW UPON ROW OF GRAVES.

EVERYONE, IT SEEMS, IS HERE.

IT’S QUIET, AND HOT, AND THE STREET SOUNDS

OF PARIS CAN’T REACH. THE GUARD WANTS TO STEER US

TO THE GRAVE OF THE MAN WHO INVENTED THE SUBMARINE,

AND MAURICE CHEVALIER’S GRAVE. AND THE GRAVE

OF THE 28-YEAR-OLD SINGER, NONNIE,

COVERED WITH A MOUND OF RED ROSES.

I WANT TO SEE THE GRAVES OF THE WRITERS.

MY SON SIGHS. HE DOESN’T WANT TO SEE ANY OF IT.

HAS SEEN ENOUGH. HE’S PASSED BEYOND BOREDOM

INTO RESIGNATION. GUY DE MAUPASSANT; SARTRE; SAINTE-BEUVE;

GAUTIER; THE GONCOURTS; PAUL VERLAINE AND HIS OLD COMRADE,

CHARLES BAUDELAIRE. WHERE WE LINGER.

NONE OF THESE NAMES, OR GRAVES, HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

WITH THE UNTROUBLED LIVES OF MY SON AND THE GUARD.

WHO CAN THIS MORNING TALK AND JOKE TOGETHER

IN THE FRENCH LANGUAGE UNDER A FINE SUN.

BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL NAMES CHISELED ON BAUDELAIRE’S STONE,

AND I CAN’T UNDERSTAND WHY.

CHARLES BAUDELAIRE’S NAME IS BETWEEN THAT OF HIS MOTHER,

WHO LOANED HIM MONEY AND WORRIED ALL HER LIFE

ABOUT HIS HEALTH, AND HIS STEPFATHER, A MARTINET

HE HATED AND WHO HATED HIM AND EVERYTHING HE STOOD FOR.

“ASK YOUR FRIEND,” I SAY. SO MY SON ASKS.

IT’S AS IF HE AND THE GUARD ARE OLD FRIENDS NOW,

AND I’M THERE TO BE HUMORED.

THE GUARD SAYS SOMETHING AND THEN LAYS

ONE HAND OVER THE OTHER. LIKE THAT. DOES IT

AGAIN. ONE HAND OVER THE OTHER. GRINNING. SHRUGGING.

MY SON TRANSLATES. BUT I UNDERSTAND.

“LIKE A SANDWICH, POP,” MY SON SAYS. “A BAUDELAIRE SANDWICH.”

AT WHICH THE THREE OF US WALK ON.

THE GUARD WOULD AS SOON BE DOING THIS AS SOMETHING ELSE.

HE LIGHTS HIS PIPE. LOOKS AT HIS WATCH. IT’S ALMOST TIME

FOR HIS LUNCH, AND A GLASS OF WINE.

“ASK HIM,” I SAY, “IF HE WANTS TO BE BURIED

IN THIS CEMETERY WHEN HE DIES.

ASK HIM WHERE HE WANTS TO BE BURIED.”

MY SON IS CAPABLE OF SAYING ANYTHING.

I RECOGNIZE THE WORDS TOMBEAU AND MORT

IN HIS MOUTH. THE GUARD STOPS.

IT’S CLEAR HIS THOUGHTS HAVE BEEN ELSEWHERE.

UNDERWATER WARFARE. THE MUSIC HALL, THE CINEMA.

SOMETHING TO EAT AND THE GLASS OF WINE.

NOT CORRUPTION, NO, AND THE FALLING AWAY.

NOT ANNIHILATION. NOT HIS DEATH.

HE LOOKS FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US.

WHO ARE WE KIDDING? ARE WE MAKING A BAD JOKE?

HE SALUTES AND WALKS AWAY.

HEADING FOR A TABLE AT AN OUTDOOR CAFÉ.

WHERE HE CAN TAKE OFF HIS CAP, RUN HIS FINGERS

THROUGH HIS HAIR. HEAR LAUGHTER AND VOICES.

THE HEAVY CLINK OF SILVERWARE. THE RINGING

OF GLASSES. SUN ON THE WINDOWS.

SUN ON THE SIDEWALK AND IN THE LEAVES.

SUN FINDING ITS WAY ONTO HIS TABLE. HIS GLASS. HIS HANDS.

NEXT DOOR
THE WOMAN ASKED US IN FOR PIE. STARTED

TELLING ABOUT HER HUSBAND, THE MAN WHO

USED TO LIVE THERE. HOW HE HAD TO BE CARTED

OFF TO THE NURSING HOME. HE WANTED

TO COVER THIS FINE OAK CEILING

WITH CHEAP INSULATION, SHE SAID. THAT WAS THE FIRST

SIGN OF ANYTHING BEING WRONG. THEN HE HAD

A STROKE. A VEGETABLE NOW. ANYWAY,

NEXT, THE GAME WARDEN STUCK THE BARREL

OF HIS PISTOL INTO HER SON’S EAR.

AND COCKED THE HAMMER. BUT THE KID

WASN’T DOING THAT MUCH WRONG, AND THE GAME

WARDEN IS THE KID’S UNCLE, DON’T YOU SEE?

SO EVERYBODY’S ON THE OUTS. EVERYBODY’S

NUTS AND NOBODY’S SPEAKING TO ANYBODY

THESE DAYS. HERE’S A BIG BONE THE SON

FOUND AT THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER.

MAYBE IT’S A HUMAN BONE? AN ARM BONE

OR SOMETHING? SHE PUTS IT BACK ON THE WINDOW-

SILL NEXT TO A BOWL OF FLOWERS.

THE DAUGHTER STAYS IN HER ROOM ALL DAY,

WRITING POEMS ABOUT HER ATTEMPTED SUICIDE.

THAT’S WHY WE DON’T SEE HER. NOBODY SEES

HER ANYMORE. SHE TEARS UP THE POEMS

AND WRITES THEM OVER AGAIN. BUT ONE OF THESE

DAYS SHE’LL GET IT RIGHT. WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT —

THE CAR THREW A ROD? THAT BLACK CAR

THAT STANDS LIKE A HEARSE

IN THE YARD NEXT DOOR. THE ENGINE WINCHED OUT,

SWINGING FROM A TREE.

THE CAUCASUS: A ROMANCE
EACH EVENING AN EAGLE SOARS DOWN FROM THE SNOWY

CRAGS AND PASSES OVER CAMP. IT WANTS TO SEE

IF IT’S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY BACK IN RUSSIA: THE ONLY

CAREER OPEN TO YOUNG MEN THESE DAYS

IS THE MILITARY. YOUNG MEN OF GOOD FAMILY, AND A FEW

OTHERS—OLDER, SILENT MEN—MEN WHO’VE BLOTTED THEIR

COPYBOOKS, AS THEY CALL IT OUT HERE. MEN LIKE

THE COLONEL, WHO LOST HIS EAR IN A DUEL.

DENSE FORESTS OF PINE, ALDER, AND BIRCH. TORRENTS

THAT FALL FROM DIZZYING PRECIPICES. MIST. CLAMOROUS

RIVERS. MOUNTAINS COVERED WITH SNOW EVEN NOW, EVEN

IN AUGUST. EVERYWHERE, AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN REACH,

PROFUSION. A SEA OF POPPIES. WILD BUCKWHEAT THAT

SHIMMERS IN THE HEAT, THAT WAVES AND ROLLS TO THE HORIZON.

PANTHERS. BEES AS BIG AS A BOY’S FIST. BEARS THAT WON’T

GET OUT OF A MAN’S WAY, THAT WILL TEAR A BODY TO

PIECES AND THEN GO BACK TO THE BUSINESS OF ROOTING

AND CHUFFING LIKE HOGS IN THE RICH UNDERGROWTH. CLOUDS

OF WHITE BUTTERFLIES THAT RISE, THEN SETTLE AND

RISE AGAIN ON SLOPES THICK WITH LILAC AND FERN.

NOW AND THEN A REAL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE ENEMY.

MUCH HOWLING FROM THEIR SIDE, CRIES, THE DRUM

OF HORSES’ HOOVES, RATTLE OF MUSKET FIRE, A CHECHEN’S BALL

SMASHING INTO A MAN’S BREAST, A STAIN THAT BLOSSOMS

AND SPREADS, THAT RIPPLES OVER THE WHITE UNIFORM LIKE CRIMSON

PETALS OPENING. THEN THE CHASE BEGINS: HEARTS RACING,

MINDS EMPTYING OUT ENTIRELY AS THE EMPEROR’S YOUNG

MEN, DANDIES ALL, GALLOP OVER PLAINS, LAUGHING,

YELLING THEIR LUNGS OUT. OR ELSE THEY URGE

THEIR LATHERED HORSES ALONG FOREST TRAILS, PISTOLS

READY. THEY BURN CHECHEN CROPS, KILL CHECHEN STOCK,

KNOCK DOWN THE PITIFUL VILLAGES. THEY’RE SOLDIERS,

AFTER ALL, AND THESE ARE NOT MANEUVERS. SHAMIL,

THE BANDIT CHIEFTAIN, HE’S THE ONE THEY WANT MOST.

AT NIGHT, A MOON BROAD AND DEEP AS A SERVING DISH

SALLIES OUT FROM BEHIND THE PEAKS. BUT THIS

MOON IS ONLY FOR APPEARANCE’S SAKE. REALLY, IT’S

ARMED TO THE TEETH, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT HERE.

WHEN THE COLONEL SLEEPS, HE DREAMS OF A DRAWING ROOM —

ONE DRAWING ROOM IN PARTICULAR—OH, CLEAN AND ELEGANT,

MOST COMFORTABLE DRAWING ROOM! WHERE FRIENDS LOUNGE

IN PLUSH CHAIRS, OR ON DIVANS, AND DRINK FROM

LITTLE GLASSES OF TEA. IN THE DREAM, IT IS ALWAYS

THURSDAY, 2—4. THERE IS A PIANO NEXT TO THE WINDOW

THAT LOOKS OUT ON NEVSKY PROSPECT. A YOUNG WOMAN

FINISHES PLAYING, PAUSES, AND TURNS TO THE POLITE

APPLAUSE. BUT IN THE DREAM IT IS THE CIRCASSIAN

WOMAN WITH A SABER CUT ACROSS HER FACE. HIS FRIENDS

DRAW BACK IN HORROR. THEY LOWER THEIR EYES, BOW,

AND BEGIN TAKING THEIR LEAVE. GOODBYE, GOODBYE,

THEY MUTTER. IN PETERSBURG THEY SAID THAT OUT HERE,

IN THE CAUCASUS, SUNSETS ARE EVERYTHING.

BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE; SUNSETS ARE NOT ENOUGH.

IN PETERSBURG THEY SAID THE CAUCASUS IS A COUNTRY THAT GIVES

RISE TO LEGEND, WHERE HEROES ARE BORN EVERY DAY.

THEY SAID, LONG AGO, IN PETERSBURG, THAT REPUTATIONS

WERE MADE, AND LOST, IN THE CAUCASUS. A GRAVELY

BEAUTIFUL PLACE, AS ONE OF THE COLONEL’S MEN PUT IT.

THE OFFICERS SERVING UNDER HIM WILL RETURN

HOME SOON, AND MORE YOUNG MEN WILL COME TO TAKE

THEIR PLACES. AFTER THE NEW ARRIVALS DISMOUNT

TO PAY THEIR RESPECTS, THE COLONEL WILL KEEP THEM

WAITING A TIME. THEN FIX THEM WITH A STERN BUT

FATHERLY GAZE, THESE SLIM YOUNG MEN WITH TINY

MUSTACHES AND BOISTEROUS HIGH SPIRITS, WHO LOOK

AT HIM AND WONDER, WHO ASK THEMSELVES WHAT IT IS

HE’S RUNNING FROM. BUT HE’S NOT RUNNING. HE LIKES IT

HERE, IN THE CAUCASUS, AFTER A FASHION. HE’S EVEN

GROWN USED TO IT—OR NEARLY. THERE’S PLENTY TO DO,

GOD KNOWS. PLENTY OF GRIM WORK IN THE DAYS, AND MONTHS,

AHEAD. SHAMIL IS OUT THERE IN THE MOUNTAINS SOMEWHERE —

OR MAYBE HE’S ON THE STEPPES. THE SCENERY IS LOVELY,

YOU CAN BE SURE, AND THIS BUT A ROUGH RECORD

OF THE ACTUAL AND THE PASSING.

A FORGE, AND A SCYTHE
ONE MINUTE I HAD THE WINDOWS OPEN

AND THE SUN WAS OUT. WARM BREEZES

BLEW THROUGH THE ROOM.

(I REMARKED ON THIS IN A LETTER.)

THEN, WHILE I WATCHED, IT GREW DARK.

THE WATER BEGAN WHITECAPPING.

ALL THE SPORT-FISHING BOATS TURNED

AND HEADED IN, A LITTLE FLEET.

THOSE WIND-CHIMES ON THE PORCH

BLEW DOWN. THE TOPS OF OUR TREES SHOOK.

THE STOVE PIPE SQUEAKED AND RATTLED

AROUND IN ITS MOORINGS.

I SAID, “A FORGE, AND A SCYTHE.”

I TALK TO MYSELF LIKE THIS.

SAYING THE NAMES OF THINGS —

CAPSTAN, HAWSER, LOAM, LEAF, FURNACE.

YOUR FACE, YOUR MOUTH, YOUR SHOULDER

INCONCEIVABLE TO ME NOW!

WHERE DID THEY GO? IT’S LIKE

I DREAMED THEM. THE STONES WE BROUGHT

HOME FROM THE BEACH LIE FACE UP

ON THE WINDOWSILL, COOLING.

COME HOME. DO YOU HEAR?

MY LUNGS ARE THICK WITH THE SMOKE

OF YOUR ABSENCE.

THE PIPE
THE NEXT POEM I WRITE WILL HAVE FIREWOOD

RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT, FIREWOOD SO THICK

WITH PITCH MY FRIEND WILL LEAVE BEHIND

HIS GLOVES AND TELL ME, “WEAR THESE WHEN YOU

HANDLE THAT STUFF.” THE NEXT POEM

WILL HAVE NIGHT IN IT, TOO, AND ALL THE STARS

IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE; AND AN IMMENSE BODY

OF WATER SHINING FOR MILES UNDER A NEW MOON.

THE NEXT POEM WILL HAVE A BEDROOM

AND LIVING ROOM FOR ITSELF, SKYLIGHTS,

A SOFA, A TABLE AND CHAIRS BY THE WINDOW,

A VASE OF VIOLETS CUT JUST AN HOUR BEFORE LUNCH.

THERE’LL BE A LAMP BURNING IN THE NEXT POEM;

AND A FIREPLACE WHERE PITCH-SOAKED

BLOCKS OF FIR FLAME UP, CONSUMING ONE ANOTHER.

OH, THE NEXT POEM WILL THROW SPARKS!

BUT THERE WON’T BE ANY CIGARETTES IN THAT POEM.

I’LL TAKE UP SMOKING THE PIPE.

LISTENING
IT WAS A NIGHT LIKE ALL THE OTHERS. EMPTY

OF EVERYTHING SAVE MEMORY. HE THOUGHT

HE’D GOT TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THINGS.

BUT HE HADN’T. HE READ A LITTLE

AND LISTENED TO THE RADIO. LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW

FOR A WHILE. THEN WENT UPSTAIRS. IN BED

REALIZED HE’D LEFT THE RADIO ON.

BUT CLOSED HIS EYES ANYWAY. INSIDE THE DEEP NIGHT,

AS THE HOUSE SAILED WEST, HE WOKE UP

TO HEAR VOICES MURMURING. AND FROZE.

THEN UNDERSTOOD IT WAS ONLY THE RADIO.

HE GOT UP AND WENT DOWNSTAIRS. HE HAD

TO PEE ANYWAY. A LITTLE RAIN

THAT HADN’T BEEN THERE BEFORE WAS

FALLING OUTSIDE. THE VOICES

ON THE RADIO FADED AND THEN CAME BACK

AS IF FROM A LONG WAY. IT WASN’T

THE SAME STATION ANY LONGER. A MAN’S VOICE

SAID SOMETHING ABOUT BORODIN,

AND HIS OPERA PRINCE IGOR. THE WOMAN

HE SAID THIS TO AGREED, AND LAUGHED.

BEGAN TO TELL A LITTLE OF THE STORY.

THE MAN’S HAND DREW BACK FROM THE SWITCH.

ONCE MORE HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE PRESENCE

OF MYSTERY. RAIN. LAUGHTER. HISTORY.

ART. THE HEGEMONY OF DEATH.

HE STOOD THERE, LISTENING.

IN SWITZERLAND
FIRST THING TO DO IN ZURICH

IS TAKE THE NO. 5 “ZOO” TROLLEY

TO THE END OF THE TRACK,

AND GET OFF. BEEN WARNED ABOUT

THE LIONS. HOW THEIR ROARS

CARRY OVER FROM THE ZOO COMPOUND

TO THE FLUTERN CEMETERY.

WHERE I WALK ALONG

THE VERY BEAUTIFUL PATH

TO JAMES JOYCE’S GRAVE.

ALWAYS THE FAMILY MAN, HE’S HERE

WITH HIS WIFE, NORA, OF COURSE.

AND HIS SON, GIORGIO,

WHO DIED A FEW YEARS AGO.

LUCIA, HIS DAUGHTER, HIS SORROW,

STILL ALIVE, STILL CONFINED

IN AN INSTITUTION FOR THE INSANE.

WHEN SHE WAS BROUGHT THE NEWS

OF HER FATHER’S DEATH, SHE SAID:

WHAT IS HE DOING UNDER THE GROUND, THAT IDIOT?

WHEN WILL HE DECIDE TO COME OUT?

HE’S WATCHING US ALL THE TIME.

I LINGERED A WHILE. I THINK

I SAID SOMETHING ALOUD TO MR JOYCE.

I MUST HAVE. I KNOW I MUST HAVE.

BUT I DON’T RECALL WHAT,

NOW, AND I’LL HAVE TO LEAVE IT AT THAT.

A WEEK LATER TO THE DAY, WE DEPART

ZURICH BY TRAIN FOR LUCERNE.

BUT EARLY THAT MORNING I TAKE

THE NO. 5 TROLLEY ONCE MORE

TO THE END OF THE LINE.

THE ROAR OF THE LIONS FALLS OVER

THE CEMETERY, AS BEFORE.

THE GRASS HAS BEEN CUT.

I SIT ON IT FOR A WHILE AND SMOKE.

JUST FEELS GOOD TO BE THERE,

CLOSE TO THE GRAVE. I DIDN’T

HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING THIS TIME.

THAT NIGHT WE GAMBLED AT THE TABLES

AT THE GRAND HOTEL-CASINO

ON THE VERY SHORE OF LAKE LUCERNE.

TOOK IN A STRIP SHOW LATER.

BUT WHAT TO DO WITH THE MEMORY

OF THAT GRAVE THAT CAME TO ME

IN THE MIDST OF THE SHOW,

UNDER THE MUTED, PINK STAGE LIGHT?

NOTHING TO DO ABOUT IT.

OR ABOUT THE DESIRE THAT CAME LATER,

CROWDING EVERYTHING ELSE OUT,

LIKE A WAVE.

STILL LATER, WE SAT ON A BENCH

UNDER SOME LINDEN TREES, UNDER STARS.

MADE LOVE WITH EACH OTHER.

REACHING INTO EACH OTHER’S CLOTHES FOR IT.

THE LAKE A FEW STEPS AWAY.

AFTERWARDS, DIPPED OUR HANDS

INTO THE COLD WATER.

THEN WALKED BACK TO OUR HOTEL,

HAPPY AND TIRED, READY TO SLEEP

FOR EIGHT HOURS.

ALL OF US, ALL OF US, ALL OF US

TRYING TO SAVE

OUR IMMORTAL SOULS, SOME WAYS

SEEMINGLY MORE ROUND-

ABOUT AND MYSTERIOUS

THAN OTHERS. WE’RE HAVING

A GOOD TIME HERE. BUT HOPE

ALL WILL BE REVEALED SOON.

A SQUALL
SHORTLY AFTER THREE P.M. TODAY A SQUALL

HIT THE CALM WATERS OF THE STRAIT.

A BLACK CLOUD MOVING FAST,

CARRYING RAIN, DRIVEN BY HIGH WINDS.

THE WATER ROSE UP AND TURNED WHITE.

THEN, IN FIVE MINUTES, WAS AS BEFORE —

BLUE AND MOST REMARKABLE, WITH JUST

A LITTLE CHOP. IT OCCURS TO ME

IT WAS THIS KIND OF SQUALL

THAT CAME UPON SHELLEY AND HIS FRIEND,

WILLIAMS, IN THE GULF OF SPEZIA, ON

AN OTHERWISE FINE DAY. THERE THEY WERE,

RUNNING AHEAD OF A SMART BREEZE,

WIND-JAMMING, CRYING OUT TO EACH OTHER,

I WANT TO THINK, IN SHEER EXUBERANCE.

IN SHELLEY’S JACKET POCKETS, KEATS’S POEMS,

AND A VOLUME OF SOPHOCLES!

THEN SOMETHING LIKE SMOKE ON THE WATER.

A BLACK CLOUD MOVING FAST,

CARRYING RAIN, DRIVEN BY HIGH WINDS.

BLACK CLOUD

HASTENING ALONG THE END

OF THE FIRST ROMANTIC PERIOD

IN ENGLISH POETRY.

MY CROW
A CROW FLEW INTO THE TREE OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.

IT WAS NOT TED HUGHES’S CROW, OR GALWAY’S CROW.

OR FROST’S, PASTERNAK’S, OR LORCA’S CROW.

OR ONE OF HOMER’S CROWS, STUFFED WITH GORE,

AFTER THE BATTLE. THIS WAS JUST A CROW.

THAT NEVER FIT IN ANYWHERE IN ITS LIFE,

OR DID ANYTHING WORTH MENTIONING.

IT SAT THERE ON THE BRANCH FOR A FEW MINUTES.

THEN PICKED UP AND FLEW BEAUTIFULLY

OUT OF MY LIFE.

THE PARTY
LAST NIGHT, ALONE, 3000 MILES AWAY FROM THE ONE

I LOVE, I TURNED THE RADIO ON TO SOME JAZZ

AND MADE A HUGE BOWL OF POPCORN

WITH LOTS OF SALT ON IT. POURED BUTTER OVER IT.

TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS AND SAT IN A CHAIR

IN FRONT OF THE WINDOW WITH THE POPCORN AND

A CAN OF COKE. FORGOT EVERYTHING IMPORTANT

IN THE WORLD WHILE I ATE POPCORN AND LOOKED OUT

AT A HEAVY SEA, AND THE LIGHTS OF TOWN.

THE POPCORN RUNNY WITH BUTTER, COVERED WITH

SALT. I ATE IT UP UNTIL THERE WAS NOTHING

LEFT EXCEPT A FEW OLD MAIDS. THEN

WASHED MY HANDS. SMOKED A COUPLE MORE CIGARETTES

WHILE I LISTENED TO THE BEAT OF THE LITTLE

MUSIC THAT WAS LEFT. THINGS HAD QUIETED WAY DOWN,

THOUGH THE SEA WAS STILL RUNNING. WIND GAVE

THE HOUSE A LAST SHAKE WHEN I ROSE

AND TOOK THREE STEPS, TURNED, TOOK THREE MORE STEPS, TURNED.

THEN I WENT TO BED AND SLEPT WONDERFULLY,

AS ALWAYS. MY GOD, WHAT A LIFE!

BUT I THOUGHT I SHOULD EXPLAIN, LEAVE A NOTE ANYHOW,

ABOUT THIS MESS IN THE LIVING ROOM

AND WHAT WENT ON HERE LAST NIGHT. JUST IN CASE

MY LIGHTS WENT OUT, AND I KEELED OVER.

YES, THERE WAS A PARTY HERE LAST NIGHT.

AND THE RADIO’S STILL ON. OKAY.

BUT IF I DIE TODAY, I DIE HAPPY—THINKING

OF MY SWEETHEART, AND OF THAT LAST POPCORN.

AFTER RAINY DAYS
AFTER RAINY DAYS AND THE SAME SERIOUS DOUBTS —

STRANGE TO WALK PAST THE GOLF COURSE,

SUN OVERHEAD, MEN PUTTING, OR TEEING, WHATEVER

THEY DO ON THOSE GREEN LINKS. TO THE RIVER THAT FLOWS

PAST THE CLUBHOUSE. EXPENSIVE HOUSES ON EITHER SIDE

OF THE RIVER, A DOG BARKING AT THIS KID

WHO REVS HIS MOTORCYCLE. TO SEE A MAN FIGHTING

A LARGE SALMON IN THE WATER JUST BELOW

THE FOOTBRIDGE. WHERE A COUPLE OF JOGGERS HAVE STOPPED

TO WATCH. NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I SEEN ANYTHING

LIKE THIS! STAY WITH HIM, I THINK, BREAKING

INTO A RUN. FOR CHRIST’S SAKE, MAN, HOLD ON!

INTERVIEW
TALKING ABOUT MYSELF ALL DAY

BROUGHT BACK

SOMETHING I THOUGHT OVER AND

DONE WITH. WHAT I’D FELT

FOR MARYANN—ANNA, SHE CALLS

HERSELF NOW—ALL THOSE YEARS.

I WENT TO DRAW A GLASS OF WATER.

STOOD AT THE WINDOW FOR A TIME.

WHEN I CAME BACK

WE PASSED EASILY TO THE NEXT THING.

WENT ON WITH MY LIFE. BUT

THAT MEMORY ENTERING LIKE A SPIKE.

BLOOD
WE WERE FIVE AT THE CRAPS TABLE

NOT COUNTING THE CROUPIER

AND HIS ASSISTANT. THE MAN

NEXT TO ME HAD THE DICE

CUPPED IN HIS HAND.

HE BLEW ON HIS FINGERS, SAID

COME ON, BABY! AND LEANED

OVER THE TABLE TO THROW.

AT THAT MOMENT, BRIGHT BLOOD RUSHED

FROM HIS NOSE, SPATTERING

THE GREEN FELT CLOTH. HE DROPPED

THE DICE. STEPPED BACK AMAZED.

AND THEN TERRIFIED AS BLOOD

RAN DOWN HIS SHIRT. GOD,

WHAT’S HAPPENING TO ME?

HE CRIED. TOOK HOLD OF MY ARM.

I HEARD DEATH’S ENGINES TURNING.

BUT I WAS YOUNG AT THE TIME,

AND DRUNK, AND WANTED TO PLAY.

I DIDN’T HAVE TO LISTEN.

SO I WALKED AWAY. DIDN’T TURN BACK, EVER,

OR FIND THIS IN MY HEAD, UNTIL TODAY.

TOMORROW
CIGARETTE SMOKE HANGING ON

IN THE LIVING ROOM. THE SHIP’S LIGHTS

OUT ON THE WATER, DIMMING. THE STARS

BURNING HOLES IN THE SKY. BECOMING ASH, YES.

BUT IT’S ALL RIGHT, THEY’RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT.

THOSE LIGHTS WE CALL STARS.

BURN FOR A TIME AND THEN DIE.

ME HELL-BENT. WISHING

IT WERE TOMORROW ALREADY.

I REMEMBER MY MOTHER, GOD LOVE HER,

SAYING, DON’T WISH FOR TOMORROW.

YOU’RE WISHING YOUR LIFE AWAY.

NEVERTHELESS, I WISH

FOR TOMORROW. IN ALL ITS FINERY.

I WANT SLEEP TO COME AND GO, SMOOTHLY.

LIKE PASSING OUT OF THE DOOR OF ONE CAR

INTO ANOTHER. AND THEN TO WAKE UP!

FIND TOMORROW IN MY BEDROOM.

I’M MORE TIRED NOW THAN I CAN SAY.

MY BOWL IS EMPTY. BUT IT’S MY BOWL, YOU SEE,

AND I LOVE IT.

GRIEF
WOKE UP EARLY THIS MORNING AND FROM MY BED

LOOKED FAR ACROSS THE STRAIT TO SEE

A SMALL BOAT MOVING THROUGH THE CHOPPY WATER,

A SINGLE RUNNING LIGHT ON. REMEMBERED

MY FRIEND WHO USED TO SHOUT

HIS DEAD WIFE’S NAME FROM HILLTOPS

AROUND PERUGIA. WHO SET A PLATE

FOR HER AT HIS SIMPLE TABLE LONG AFTER

SHE WAS GONE. AND OPENED THE WINDOWS

SO SHE COULD HAVE FRESH AIR. SUCH DISPLAY

I FOUND EMBARRASSING. SO DID HIS OTHER

FRIENDS. I COULDN’T SEE IT.

NOT UNTIL THIS MORNING.

HARLEY’S SWANS
I’M TRYING AGAIN. A MAN HAS TO BEGIN

OVER AND OVER—TO TRY TO THINK AND FEEL

ONLY IN A VERY LIMITED FIELD, THE HOUSE

ON THE STREET, THE MAN AT THE CORNER DRUG STORE.

— SHERWOOD ANDERSON, FROM A LETTER

ANDERSON, I THOUGHT OF YOU WHEN I LOITERED

IN FRONT OF THE DRUG STORE THIS AFTERNOON.

HELD ONTO MY HAT IN THE WIND AND LOOKED DOWN

THE STREET FOR MY BOYHOOD. REMEMBERED MY DAD

TAKING ME TO GET HAIRCUTS —

THAT RACK OF ANTLERS MOUNTED ON A WALL

NEXT TO THE CALENDAR PICTURE OF A RAINBOW

TROUT LEAPING CLEAR OF THE WATER

WITH A HOOK IN ITS JAW. MY MOTHER.

HOW SHE WENT WITH ME TO PICK OUT

SCHOOL CLOTHES. THAT PART EMBARRASSING

BECAUSE I NEEDED TO SHOP IN MEN’S WEAR

FOR MAN-SIZED PANTS AND SHIRTS.

NOBODY, THEN, WHO COULD LOVE ME,

THE FATTEST KID ON THE BLOCK, EXCEPT MY PARENTS.

SO I QUIT LOOKING AND WENT INSIDE.

HAD A COKE AT THE SODA FOUNTAIN

WHERE I GAVE SOME THOUGHT TO BETRAYAL.

HOW THAT PART ALWAYS CAME EASY.

IT WAS WHAT CAME AFTER THAT WAS HARD.

I DIDN’T THINK ABOUT YOU ANYMORE, ANDERSON.

YOU’D COME AND GONE IN AN INSTANT.

BUT I REMEMBERED, THERE AT THE FOUNTAIN,

HARLEY’S SWANS. HOW THEY GOT THERE

I DON’T KNOW. BUT ONE MORNING HE WAS TAKING

HIS SCHOOL BUS ALONG A COUNTRY ROAD

WHEN HE CAME ACROSS 21 OF THEM JUST DOWN

FROM CANADA. OUT ON THIS POND

IN A FARMER’S FIELD. HE BROUGHT HIS SCHOOL BUS

TO A STOP, AND THEN HE AND HIS GRADE-SCHOOLERS

JUST LOOKED AT THEM FOR A WHILE AND FELT GOOD.

I FINISHED THE COKE AND DROVE HOME.

IT WAS ALMOST DARK NOW. THE HOUSE

QUIET AND EMPTY. THE WAY

I ALWAYS THOUGHT I WANTED IT TO BE.

THE WIND BLEW HARD ALL DAY.

BLEW EVERYTHING AWAY, OR NEARLY.

BUT STILL THIS FEELING OF SHAME AND LOSS.

EVEN THOUGH THE WIND OUGHT TO LAY NOW

AND THE MOON COME OUT SOON, IF THIS IS

ANYTHING LIKE THE OTHER NIGHTS.

I’M HERE IN THE HOUSE. AND I WANT TO TRY AGAIN.

YOU, OF ALL PEOPLE, ANDERSON, CAN UNDERSTAND.

ELK CAMP
EVERYONE ELSE SLEEPING WHEN I STEP

TO THE DOOR OF OUR TENT. OVERHEAD,

STARS BRIGHTER THAN STARS EVER WERE

IN MY LIFE. AND FARTHER AWAY.

THE NOVEMBER MOON DRIVING

A FEW DARK CLOUDS OVER THE VALLEY.

THE OLYMPIC RANGE BEYOND.

I BELIEVED I COULD SMELL THE SNOW THAT WAS COMING.

OUR HORSES FEEDING INSIDE

THE LITTLE ROPE CORRAL WE’D THROWN UP.

FROM THE SIDE OF THE HILL THE SOUND

OF SPRING WATER. OUR SPRING WATER.

WIND PASSING IN THE TOPS OF THE FIR TREES.

I’D NEVER SMELLED A FOREST BEFORE THAT

NIGHT, EITHER. REMEMBERED READING HOW

HENRY HUDSON AND HIS SAILORS SMELLED

THE FORESTS OF THE NEW WORLD

FROM MILES OUT AT SEA. AND THEN THE NEXT THOUGHT —

I COULD GLADLY LIVE THE REST OF MY LIFE

AND NEVER PICK UP ANOTHER BOOK.

I LOOKED AT MY HANDS IN THE MOONLIGHT

AND UNDERSTOOD THERE WASN’T A MAN,

WOMAN, OR CHILD I COULD LIFT A FINGER

FOR THAT NIGHT. I TURNED BACK AND LAY

DOWN THEN IN MY SLEEPING BAG.

BUT MY EYES WOULDN’T CLOSE.

THE NEXT DAY I FOUND COUGAR SCAT

AND ELK DROPPINGS. BUT THOUGH I RODE

A HORSE ALL OVER THAT COUNTRY,

UP AND DOWN HILLS, THROUGH CLOUDS

AND ALONG OLD LOGGING ROADS,

I NEVER SAW AN ELK. WHICH WAS

FINE BY ME. STILL, I WAS READY.

LOST TO EVERYONE, A RIFLE STRAPPED

TO MY SHOULDER. I THINK MAYBE

I COULD HAVE KILLED ONE.

WOULD HAVE SHOT AT ONE, ANYWAY.

AIMED JUST WHERE I’D BEEN TOLD —

BEHIND THE SHOULDER AT THE HEART

AND LUNGS. “THEY MIGHT RUN,

BUT THEY WON’T RUN FAR.

LOOK AT IT THIS WAY,” MY FRIEND SAID.

“HOW FAR WOULD YOU RUN WITH A PIECE

OF LEAD IN YOUR HEART?” THAT DEPENDS,

MY FRIEND. THAT DEPENDS. BUT THAT DAY

I COULD HAVE PULLED THE TRIGGER

ON ANYTHING. OR NOT.

NOTHING MATTERED ANYMORE

EXCEPT GETTING BACK TO CAMP

BEFORE DARK. WONDERFUL

TO LIVE THIS WAY! WHERE NOTHING

MATTERED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

I SAW MYSELF THROUGH AND THROUGH.

AND I UNDERSTOOD SOMETHING, TOO,

AS MY LIFE FLEW BACK TO ME THERE IN THE WOODS.

AND THEN WE PACKED OUT. WHERE THE FIRST

THING I DID WAS TAKE A HOT BATH.

AND THEN REACH FOR THIS BOOK.

GROW COLD AND UNRELENTING ONCE MORE.

HEARTLESS. EVERY NERVE ALERT.

READY TO KILL, OR NOT.

THE WINDOWS OF THE
SUMMER VACATION HOUSES
THEY WITHHELD JUDGMENT, LOOKING DOWN AT US

SILENTLY, IN THE RAIN, IN OUR LITTLE BOAT —

AS THREE LINES WENT INTO THE DARK WATER

FOR SALMON. I’M TALKING OF THE HOOD CANAL

IN MARCH, WHEN THE RAIN WON’T LET UP.

WHICH WAS FINE BY ME. I WAS HAPPY

TO BE ON THE WATER, TRYING OUT

NEW GEAR. I HEARD OF THE DEATH,

BY DROWNING, OF A MAN I DIDN’T KNOW.

AND THE DEATH IN THE WOODS OF ANOTHER,

HIT BY A SNAG. THEY DON’T CALL THEM

WIDOW-MAKERS FOR NOTHING.

HUNTING STORIES OF BEAR,

ELK, DEER, COUGAR—TAKEN IN AND OUT

OF SEASON. MORE HUNTING STORIES.

WOMEN, THIS TIME. AND THIS TIME

I COULD JOIN IN. IT USED TO BE GIRLS.

GIRLS OF 15, 16, 17, 18—AND WE

THE SAME AGE. NOW IT WAS WOMEN. AND MARRIED

WOMEN AT THAT. NO LONGER GIRLS. WOMEN.

SOMEBODY OR OTHER’S WIFE. THE MAYOR

OF THIS TOWN, FOR INSTANCE. HIS WIFE.

TAKEN. THE DEPUTY SHERIFF’S WIFE, THE SAME.

BUT HE’S AN ASSHOLE, ANYWAY.

EVEN A BROTHER’S WIFE. IT’S NOT ANYTHING

TO BE PROUD OF, BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO GO

AND DO HIS HOMEWORK FOR HIM. WE CAUGHT

TWO SMALL ONES, AND TALKED A LOT, AND LAUGHED.

BUT AS WE TURNED IN TO THE LANDING

A LIGHT WENT ON IN ONE OF THOSE HOUSES

WHERE NOBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

SMOKE DRIFTED UP FROM THE CHIMNEY

OF THIS PLACE WE’D LOOKED AT AS EMPTY.

AND SUDDENLY, LIKE THAT—I REMEMBERED MARYANN.

WHEN WE WERE BOTH YOUNG.

THE RARE COIN OF THOSE MINT DAYS!

IT WAS THERE AND GONE

BY THE TIME WE HOOKED THE BOAT TO THE TRAILER.

BUT IT WAS SOMETHING TO RECALL.

IT TURNED DARK AS I WATCHED THE FIGURE

MOVE TO STAND AT THE WINDOW AND LOOK

DOWN. AND I KNEW THEN THOSE THINGS THAT HAPPENED

SO LONG AGO MUST HAVE HAPPENED, BUT NOT

TO US. NO, I DON’T THINK PEOPLE COULD GO ON LIVING

IF THEY HAD LIVED THOSE THINGS. IT COULDN’T

HAVE BEEN US.

THE PEOPLE I’M TALKING ABOUT—I’M SURE

I MUST HAVE READ ABOUT SOMEWHERE.

THEY WERE NOT THE MAIN CHARACTERS, NO,

AS I’D THOUGHT AT FIRST AND FOR A LONG

WHILE AFTER. BUT SOME OTHERS YOU

SYMPATHIZED WITH, EVEN LOVED, AND CRIED FOR —

JUST BEFORE THEY WERE TAKEN AWAY

TO BE HANGED, OR PUT SOMEWHERE.

WE DROVE OFF WITHOUT LOOKING BACK

AT THE HOUSES. LAST NIGHT

I CLEANED FISH IN THE KITCHEN.

THIS MORNING IT WAS STILL DARK

WHEN I MADE COFFEE. AND FOUND BLOOD

ON THE PORCELAIN SIDES OF THE SINK.

MORE BLOOD ON THE COUNTER. A TRAIL

OF IT. DROPS OF BLOOD ON THE BOTTOM

OF THE REFRIGERATOR WHERE THE FISH

LAY WRAPPED AND GUTTED.

EVERYWHERE THIS BLOOD. MINGLING WITH THOUGHTS

IN MY MIND OF THE TIME WE’D HAD —

THAT DEAR YOUNG WIFE, AND I.

MEMORY [I]
CUTTING THE STEMS FROM A QUART

BASKET OF STRAWBERRIES—THE FIRST

THIS SPRING—LOOKING FORWARD TO HOW

I WOULD EAT THEM TONIGHT, WHEN I WAS

ALONE, FOR A TREAT (TESS BEING AWAY),

I REMEMBERED I FORGOT TO PASS ALONG

A MESSAGE TO HER WHEN WE TALKED:

SOMEBODY WHOSE NAME I FORGET

CALLED TO SAY SUSAN POWELL’S

GRANDMOTHER HAD DIED, SUDDENLY.

WENT ON WORKING WITH THE STRAWBERRIES.

BUT REMEMBERED, TOO, DRIVING BACK

FROM THE STORE. A LITTLE GIRL

ON ROLLER SKATES BEING PULLED ALONG

THE ROAD BY THIS BIG FRIENDLY-

LOOKING DOG. I WAVED TO HER.

SHE WAVED BACK. AND CALLED OUT

SHARPLY TO HER DOG, WHO KEPT

TRYING TO NOSE AROUND

IN THE SWEET DITCH GRASS.

    IT’S NEARLY DARK OUTSIDE NOW.

STRAWBERRIES ARE CHILLING.

A LITTLE LATER ON, WHEN I EAT THEM,

I’LL BE REMINDED AGAIN—IN NO PARTICULAR

ORDER—OF TESS, THE LITTLE GIRL, A DOG,

ROLLER SKATES, MEMORY, DEATH, ETC.

AWAY
I HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT THE QUAIL THAT LIVE

ON THE HILLSIDE OVER BEHIND ART AND MARILYN’S

PLACE. I OPENED UP THE HOUSE, MADE A FIRE,

AND AFTERWARDS SLEPT LIKE A DEAD MAN.

THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE QUAIL IN THE DRIVE

AND IN THE BUSHES OUTSIDE THE FRONT WINDOW.

I TALKED TO YOU ON THE PHONE.

TRIED TO JOKE. DON’T WORRY

ABOUT ME, I SAID, I HAVE THE QUAIL

FOR COMPANY. WELL, THEY TOOK FLIGHT

WHEN I OPENED THE DOOR. A WEEK LATER

AND THEY STILL HAVEN’T COME BACK. WHEN I LOOK

AT THE SILENT TELEPHONE I THINK OF QUAIL.

WHEN I THINK OF THE QUAIL AND HOW THEY

WENT AWAY, I REMEMBER TALKING TO YOU THAT MORNING

AND HOW THE RECEIVER LAY IN MY HAND. MY HEART —

THE BLURRED THINGS IT WAS DOING AT THE TIME.

MUSIC
FRANZ LISZT ELOPED WITH COUNTESS MARIE D’AGOULT,

WHO WROTE NOVELS. POLITE SOCIETY WASHED ITS HANDS

OF HIM, AND HIS NOVELIST-COUNTESS-WHORE.

LISZT GAVE HER THREE CHILDREN, AND MUSIC.

THEN WENT OFF WITH PRINCESS WITTGENSTEIN.

COSIMA, LISZT’S DAUGHTER, MARRIED

THE CONDUCTOR, HANS VON BÜLOW.

BUT RICHARD WAGNER STOLE HER. TOOK HER AWAY

TO BAYREUTH. WHERE LISZT SHOWED UP ONE MORNING.

LONG WHITE HAIR FLOUNCING.

SHAKING HIS FIST. MUSIC. MUSIC!

EVERYBODY GREW MORE FAMOUS.

PLUS
“LATELY I’VE BEEN EATING A LOT OF PORK.

PLUS, I EAT TOO MANY EGGS AND THINGS,”

THIS GUY SAID TO ME IN THE DOC’S OFFICE.

“I POUR ON THE SALT. I DRINK TWENTY CUPS

OF COFFEE EVERY DAY. I SMOKE.

I’M HAVING TROUBLE WITH MY BREATHING.”

THEN LOWERED HIS EYES.

“PLUS, I DON’T ALWAYS CLEAR OFF THE TABLE

WHEN I’M THROUGH EATING. I FORGET.

I JUST GET UP AND WALK AWAY.

GOODBYE UNTIL THE NEXT TIME, BROTHER.

MISTER, WHAT DO YOU THINK’S HAPPENING TO ME?”

HE WAS DESCRIBING MY OWN SYMPTOMS TO A T.

I SAID, “WHAT DO YOU THINK’S HAPPENING?

YOU’RE LOSING YOUR MARBLES. AND THEN

YOU’RE GOING TO DIE. OR VICE VERSA.

WHAT ABOUT SWEETS? ARE YOU PARTIAL

TO CINNAMON ROLLS AND ICE CREAM?”

“PLUS, I CRAVE ALL THAT,” HE SAID.

BY THIS TIME WE WERE AT A PLACE CALLED FRIENDLY’S.

WE LOOKED AT MENUS AND WENT ON TALKING.

DINNER MUSIC PLAYED FROM A RADIO

IN THE KITCHEN. IT WAS OUR SONG, SEE.

IT WAS OUR TABLE.

ALL HER LIFE
I LAY DOWN FOR A NAP. BUT EVERY TIME I CLOSED MY EYES,

MARES’ TAILS PASSED SLOWLY OVER THE STRAIT

TOWARD CANADA. AND THE WAVES. THEY ROLLED UP ON THE BEACH

AND THEN BACK AGAIN. YOU KNOW I DON’T DREAM.

BUT LAST NIGHT I DREAMT WE WERE WATCHING

A BURIAL AT SEA. AT FIRST I WAS ASTONISHED.

AND THEN FILLED WITH REGRET. BUT YOU

TOUCHED MY ARM AND SAID, “NO, IT’S ALL RIGHT.

SHE WAS VERY OLD, AND HE’D LOVED HER ALL HER LIFE.”

THE HAT
WALKING AROUND ON OUR FIRST DAY

IN MEXICO CITY, WE COME TO A SIDEWALK CAFÉ

ON REFORMA AVENUE WHERE A MAN IN A HAT

SITS DRINKING A BEER.

AT FIRST THE MAN SEEMS JUST LIKE ANY

OTHER MAN, WEARING A HAT, DRINKING A BEER

IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY. BUT NEXT TO THIS MAN,

ASLEEP ON THE BROAD SIDEWALK, IS A BEAR

WITH ITS HEAD ON ITS PAWS. THE BEAR’S

EYES ARE CLOSED, BUT NOT ALL THE WAY. AS IF

IT WERE THERE, AND NOT THERE. EVERYONE

IS GIVING THE BEAR A WIDE BERTH.

BUT A CROWD IS GATHERING, TOO, BULGING

OUT ONTO THE AVENUE. THE MAN HAS

A CHAIN AROUND HIS WAIST. THE CHAIN

GOES FROM HIS LAP TO THE BEAR’S COLLAR,

A BAND OF STEEL. ON THE TABLE

IN FRONT OF THE MAN RESTS AN IRON BAR

WITH A LEATHER HANDLE. AND AS IF THIS

WERE NOT ENOUGH, THE MAN DRAINS THE LAST

OF HIS BEER AND PICKS UP HIS BAR.

GETS UP FROM THE TABLE AND HAULS

ON THE CHAIN. THE BEAR STIRS, OPENS ITS

MOUTH—OLD BROWN AND YELLOW FANGS.

BUT FANGS. THE MAN JERKS ON THE CHAIN,

HARD. THE BEAR RISES TO ALL FOURS NOW

AND GROWLS. THE MAN SLAPS THE BEAR ON

ITS SHOULDER WITH THE BAR, BRINGING

A TINY CLOUD OF DUST. GROWLS SOMETHING

HIMSELF. THE BEAR WAITS WHILE THE MAN TAKES

ANOTHER SWING. SLOWLY, THE BEAR RISES

ONTO ITS HIND LEGS, SWINGS AT AIR AND AT

THAT GODDAMNED BAR. BEGINS TO SHUFFLE

THEN, BEGINS TO SNAP ITS JAWS AS THE MAN

SLUGS IT AGAIN, AND, YES, AGAIN

WITH THAT BAR. THERE’S A TAMBORINE.

I NEARLY FORGOT THAT. THE MAN SHAKES

IT AS HE CHANTS, AS HE STRIKES THE BEAR

WHO WEAVES ON ITS HIND LEGS. GROWLS

AND SNAPS AND WEAVES IN A POOR DANCE.

THIS SCENE LASTS FOREVER. WHOLE SEASONS

COME AND GO BEFORE IT’S OVER AND THE BEAR

DROPS TO ALL FOURS. SITS DOWN ON ITS

HAUNCHES, GIVES A LOW, SAD GROWL.

THE MAN PUTS THE TAMBORINE ON THE TABLE.

PUTS THE IRON BAR ON THE TABLE, TOO.

THEN HE TAKES OFF HIS HAT. NO ONE

APPLAUDS. A FEW PEOPLE SEE

WHAT’S COMING AND WALK AWAY. BUT NOT

BEFORE THE HAT APPEARS AT THE EDGE

OF THE CROWD AND BEGINS TO MAKE ITS

WAY FROM HAND TO HAND

THROUGH THE THRONG. THE HAT

COMES TO ME AND STOPS. I’M HOLDING

THE HAT, AND I CAN’T BELIEVE IT.

EVERYBODY STARING AT IT.

I STARE RIGHT ALONG WITH THEM.

YOU SAY MY NAME, AND IN THE SAME BREATH

HISS, “FOR GOD’S SAKE, PASS IT ALONG.”

I TOSS IN THE MONEY I HAVE. THEN

WE LEAVE AND GO ON TO THE NEXT THING.

HOURS LATER, IN BED, I TOUCH YOU

AND WAIT, AND THEN TOUCH YOU AGAIN.

WHEREUPON, YOU UNCURL YOUR FINGERS.

I PUT MY HANDS ALL OVER YOU THEN —

YOUR LIMBS, YOUR LONG HAIR EVEN, HAIR

THAT I TOUCH AND COVER MY FACE WITH,

AND DRAW SALT FROM. BUT LATER,

WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES, THE HAT

APPEARS. THEN THE TAMBORINE. THE CHAIN.

LATE NIGHT WITH FOG AND HORSES
THEY WERE IN THE LIVING ROOM. SAYING THEIR

GOODBYES. LOSS RINGING IN THEIR EARS.

THEY’D BEEN THROUGH A LOT TOGETHER, BUT NOW

THEY COULDN’T GO ANOTHER STEP. BESIDES, FOR HIM

THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE. TEARS WERE FALLING

WHEN A HORSE STEPPED OUT OF THE FOG

INTO THE FRONT YARD. THEN ANOTHER, AND

ANOTHER. SHE WENT OUTSIDE AND SAID,

“WHERE DID YOU COME FROM, YOU SWEET HORSES?”

AND MOVED IN AMONGST THEM, WEEPING,

TOUCHING THEIR FLANKS. THE HORSES BEGAN

TO GRAZE IN THE FRONT YARD.

HE MADE TWO CALLS: ONE CALL WENT STRAIGHT

TO THE SHERIFF— “SOMEONE’S HORSES ARE OUT.”

BUT THERE WAS THAT OTHER CALL, TOO.

THEN HE JOINED HIS WIFE IN THE FRONT

YARD, WHERE THEY TALKED AND MURMURED

TO THE HORSES TOGETHER. (WHATEVER WAS

HAPPENING NOW WAS HAPPENING IN ANOTHER TIME.)

HORSES CROPPED THE GRASS IN THE YARD

THAT NIGHT. A RED EMERGENCY LIGHT

FLASHED AS A SEDAN CREPT IN OUT OF FOG.

VOICES CARRIED OUT OF THE FOG.

AT THE END OF THAT LONG NIGHT,

WHEN THEY FINALLY PUT THEIR ARMS AROUND

EACH OTHER, THEIR EMBRACE WAS FULL OF

PASSION AND MEMORY. EACH RECALLED

THE OTHER’S YOUTH. NOW SOMETHING HAD ENDED,

SOMETHING ELSE RUSHING IN TO TAKE ITS PLACE.

CAME THE MOMENT OF LEAVE-TAKING ITSELF.

“GOODBYE, GO ON,” SHE SAID.

AND THE PULLING AWAY.

MUCH LATER,

HE REMEMBERED MAKING A DISASTROUS PHONE CALL.

ONE THAT HAD HUNG ON AND HUNG ON,

A MALEDICTION. IT’S BOILED DOWN

TO THAT. THE REST OF HIS LIFE.

MALEDICTION.

VENICE
THE GONDOLIER HANDED YOU A ROSE.

TOOK US UP ONE CANAL

AND THEN ANOTHER. WE GLIDED

PAST CASANOVA’S PALACE, THE PALACE OF

THE ROSSI FAMILY, PALACES BELONGING

TO THE BAGLIONI, THE PISANI, AND SANGALLO.

FLOODED. STINKING. WHAT’S LEFT

LEFT TO RATS. BLACKNESS.

THE SILENCE TOTAL, OR NEARLY.

THE MAN’S BREATH COMING AND GOING

BEHIND MY EAR. THE DRIP OF THE OAR.

WE GLIDING SILENTLY ON, AND ON.

WHO WOULD BLAME ME IF I FALL

TO THINKING ABOUT DEATH?

A SHUTTER OPENED ABOVE OUR HEADS.

A LITTLE LIGHT SHOWED THROUGH

BEFORE THE SHUTTER WAS CLOSED ONCE

MORE. THERE IS THAT, AND THE ROSE

IN YOUR HAND. AND HISTORY.

THE EVE OF BATTLE
THERE ARE FIVE OF US IN THE TENT, NOT COUNTING

THE BATMAN CLEANING MY RIFLE. THERE’S

A LIVELY ARGUMENT GOING ON AMONGST MY BROTHER

OFFICERS. IN THE COOKPOT, SALT PORK TURNS

ALONGSIDE SOME MACARONI. BUT THESE FINE FELLOWS

AREN’T HUNGRY—AND IT’S A GOOD THING!

ALL THEY WANT IS TO HARRUMPH ABOUT THE LIKES

OF HUSS AND HEGEL, ANYTHING TO PASS THE TIME.

WHO CARES? TOMORROW WE FIGHT. TONIGHT THEY WANT

TO SIT AROUND AND CHATTER ABOUT NOTHING, ABOUT

PHILOSOPHY. MAYBE THE COOKPOT ISN’T THERE

FOR THEM? NOR THE STOVE, OR THOSE FOLDING

STOOLS THEY’RE SITTING ON. MAYBE THERE ISN’T

A BATTLE WAITING FOR THEM TOMORROW MORNING?

WE’D ALL LIKE THAT BEST. MAYBE

I’M NOT THERE FOR THEM, EITHER. READY

TO DISH UP SOMETHING TO EAT. UN EST AUTRE,

AS SOMEONE SAID. I, OR ANOTHER, MAY AS WELL BE

IN CHINA. TIME TO EAT, BROTHERS,

I SAY, HANDING ROUND THE PLATES. BUT SOMEONE

HAS JUST RIDDEN UP AND DISMOUNTED. MY BATMAN

MOVES TO THE DOOR OF THE TENT, THEN DROPS HIS PLATE

AND STEPS BACK. DEATH WALKS IN WITHOUT SAYING

ANYTHING, DRESSED IN COAT-AND-TAILS.

AT FIRST I THINK HE MUST BE LOOKING FOR THE EMPEROR,

WHO’S OLD AND AILING ANYWAY. THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

IT. DEATH’S LOST HIS WAY. WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?

HE HAS A SLIP OF PAPER IN HIS HAND, LOOKS US OVER

QUICKLY, CONSULTS SOME NAMES.

HE RAISES HIS EYES. I TURN TO THE STOVE.

WHEN I TURN BACK, EVERYONE HAS GONE. EVERYONE

EXCEPT DEATH. HE’S STILL THERE, UNMOVING.

I GIVE HIM HIS PLATE. HE’S COME A LONG

WAY. HE IS HUNGRY, I THINK, AND WILL EAT ANYTHING.

EXTIRPATION
A LITTLE QUIETLY OUTSTANDING UPTOWN

PIANO MUSIC PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND

AS WE SAT AT THE BAR IN THE LOUNGE.

DISCUSSING THE FATE OF THE LAST CARIBOU HERD IN THE US.

THIRTY ANIMALS WHO ROAM A SMALL CORNER

OF THE IDAHO PANHANDLE. THIRTY ANIMALS

JUST NORTH OF BONNER’S FERRY,

THIS GUY SAID. THEN CALLED FOR ANOTHER ROUND.

BUT I HAD TO GO. WE NEVER SAW EACH OTHER AGAIN.

NEVER SPOKE ANOTHER WORD TO EACH OTHER,

OR DID ANYTHING WORTH GETTING EXCITED ABOUT

THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

THE CATCH
HAPPY TO HAVE THESE FISH!

IN SPITE OF THE RAIN, THEY CAME

TO THE SURFACE AND TOOK

THE NO. 14 BLACK MOSQUITO.

HE HAD TO CONCENTRATE,

CLOSE EVERYTHING ELSE OUT

FOR A CHANGE. HIS OLD LIFE,

WHICH HE CARRIED AROUND

LIKE A PACK. AND THE NEW ONE,

THAT ONE TOO. TIME AND AGAIN

HE MADE WHAT HE FELT WERE THE MOST

INTIMATE OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS.

STRAINED HIS HEART TO SEE

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RAINDROP

AND A BROOK TROUT. LATER,

WALKING ACROSS THE WET FIELD

TO THE CAR. WATCHING

THE WIND CHANGE THE ASPEN TREES.

HE ABANDONED EVERYONE

HE ONCE LOVED.

MY DEATH
IF I’M LUCKY, I’LL BE WIRED EVERY WHICHWAY

IN A HOSPITAL BED. TUBES RUNNING INTO

MY NOSE. BUT TRY NOT TO BE SCARED OF ME, FRIENDS!

I’M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THAT THIS IS OKAY.

IT’S LITTLE ENOUGH TO ASK FOR AT THE END.

SOMEONE, I HOPE, WILL HAVE PHONED EVERYONE

TO SAY, “COME QUICK, HE’S FAILING!”

AND THEY WILL COME. AND THERE WILL BE TIME FOR ME

TO BID GOODBYE TO EACH OF MY LOVED ONES.

IF I’M LUCKY, THEY’LL STEP FORWARD

AND I’LL BE ABLE TO SEE THEM ONE LAST TIME

AND TAKE THAT MEMORY WITH ME.

SURE, THEY MIGHT LAY EYES ON ME AND WANT TO RUN AWAY

AND HOWL. BUT INSTEAD, SINCE THEY LOVE ME,

THEY’LL LIFT MY HAND AND SAY “COURAGE”

OR “IT’S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.”

AND THEY’RE RIGHT. IT IS ALL RIGHT.

IT’S JUST FINE. IF YOU ONLY KNEW HOW HAPPY YOU’VE MADE ME!

I JUST HOPE MY LUCK HOLDS, AND I CAN MAKE

SOME SIGN OF RECOGNITION.

OPEN AND CLOSE MY EYES AS IF TO SAY,

“YES, I HEAR YOU. I UNDERSTAND YOU.”

I MAY EVEN MANAGE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

“I LOVE YOU TOO. BE HAPPY.”

I HOPE SO! BUT I DON’T WANT TO ASK FOR TOO MUCH.

IF I’M UNLUCKY, AS I DESERVE, WELL, I’LL JUST

DROP OVER, LIKE THAT, WITHOUT ANY CHANCE

FOR FAREWELL, OR TO PRESS ANYONE’S HAND.

OR SAY HOW MUCH I CARED FOR YOU AND ENJOYED

YOUR COMPANY ALL THESE YEARS. IN ANY CASE,

TRY NOT TO MOURN FOR ME TOO MUCH. I WANT YOU TO KNOW

I WAS HAPPY WHEN I WAS HERE.

AND REMEMBER I TOLD YOU THIS A WHILE AGO—APRIL 1984.

BUT BE GLAD FOR ME IF I CAN DIE IN THE PRESENCE

OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IF THIS HAPPENS, BELIEVE ME,

I CAME OUT AHEAD. I DIDN’T LOSE THIS ONE.

TO BEGIN WITH
HE TOOK A ROOM IN A PORT CITY WITH A FELLOW

CALLED SULIEMAN A. SULIEMAN AND HIS WIFE,

AN AMERICAN KNOWN ONLY AS BONNIE. ONE THING

HE REMEMBERED ABOUT HIS STAY THERE

WAS HOW EVERY EVENING SULIEMAN RAPPED

AT HIS OWN FRONT DOOR BEFORE ENTERING.

SAYING, “RIGHT, HELLO. SULIEMAN HERE.”

AFTER THAT, SULIEMAN TAKING OFF HIS SHOES.

PUTTING PITA BREAD AND HUMMUS INTO HIS MOUTH

IN THE COMPANY OF HIS SILENT WIFE.

SOMETIMES THERE WAS A PIECE OF CHICKEN

FOLLOWED BY CUCUMBERS AND TOMATOES.

THEN THEY ALL WATCHED WHAT PASSED FOR TV

IN THAT COUNTRY. BONNIE SITTING IN A CHAIR

TO HERSELF, RAVING AGAINST THE JEWS.

AT ELEVEN O’CLOCK SHE WOULD SAY, “WE HAVE TO SLEEP NOW.”

BUT ONCE THEY LEFT THEIR BEDROOM DOOR OPEN.

AND HE SAW SULIEMAN MAKE HIS BED ON THE FLOOR

BESIDE THE BIG BED WHERE BONNIE LAY

AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HUSBAND.

THEY SAID SOMETHING TO EACH OTHER IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

SULIEMAN ARRANGED HIS SHOES BY HIS HEAD.

BONNIE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT, AND THEY SLEPT.

BUT THE MAN IN THE ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE

COULDN’T SLEEP AT ALL. IT WAS AS IF

HE DIDN’T BELIEVE IN SLEEP ANY LONGER.

SLEEP HAD BEEN ALL RIGHT, ONCE, IN ITS TIME.

BUT IT WAS DIFFERENT NOW.

LYING THERE AT NIGHT, EYES OPEN, ARMS AT HIS SIDES,

HIS THOUGHTS WENT OUT TO HIS WIFE,

AND HIS CHILDREN, AND EVERYTHING THAT BORE

ON THAT LEAVE-TAKING. EVEN THE SHOES

HE’D BEEN WEARING WHEN HE LEFT HIS HOUSE

AND WALKED OUT. THEY WERE THE REAL BETRAYERS,

HE DECIDED. THEY’D BROUGHT HIM ALL THIS WAY

WITHOUT ONCE TRYING TO DO ANYTHING TO STOP HIM.

FINALLY, HIS THOUGHTS CAME BACK TO THIS ROOM

AND THIS HOUSE. WHERE THEY BELONGED.

WHERE HE KNEW HE WAS HOME.

WHERE A MAN SLEPT ON THE FLOOR OF HIS OWN BEDROOM.

A MAN WHO KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF HIS OWN HOUSE,

ANNOUNCING HIS MEAGER ARRIVAL. SULIEMAN.

WHO ENTERED HIS HOUSE ONLY AFTER KNOCKING

AND THEN TO EAT PITA BREAD AND TOMATOES

WITH HIS BITTER WIFE. BUT IN THE COURSE OF THOSE LONG NIGHTS

HE BEGAN TO ENVY SULIEMAN A LITTLE.

NOT MUCH, BUT A LITTLE. AND SO WHAT IF HE DID!

SULIEMAN SLEEPING ON HIS BEDROOM FLOOR.

BUT SULIEMAN SLEEPING IN THE SAME ROOM,

AT LEAST, AS HIS WIFE.

MAYBE IT WAS ALL RIGHT IF SHE SNORED

AND HAD BLIND PREJUDICES. SHE WASN’T SO BAD-

LOOKING, THAT MUCH WAS TRUE, AND IF

SULIEMAN WOKE UP HE COULD AT LEAST

HEAR HER FROM HIS PLACE. KNOW SHE WAS THERE.

THERE MIGHT EVEN BE NIGHTS WHEN HE COULD REACH

OVER AND TOUCH HER THROUGH THE BLANKET

WITHOUT WAKING HER. BONNIE. HIS WIFE.

MAYBE IN THIS LIFE IT WAS NECESSARY TO LEARN

TO PRETEND TO BE A DOG AND SLEEP ON THE FLOOR

IN ORDER TO GET ALONG. SOMETIMES

THIS MIGHT BE NECESSARY. WHO KNOWS

ANYTHING THESE DAYS?

AT LEAST IT WAS A NEW IDEA AND SOMETHING,

HE THOUGHT, HE MIGHT HAVE TO TRY AND UNDERSTAND.

OUTSIDE, THE MOON REACHED OVER THE WATER

AND DISAPPEARED FINALLY. FOOTSTEPS

MOVED SLOWLY DOWN THE STREET AND CAME TO A STOP

OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW. THE STREETLIGHT

WENT OUT, AND THE STEPS PASSED ON.

THE HOUSE BECAME STILL AND, IN ONE WAY AT LEAST,

LIKE ALL THE OTHER HOUSES—TOTALLY DARK.

HE HELD ONTO HIS BLANKET AND STARED AT THE CEILING.

HE HAD TO START OVER. TO BEGIN WITH –

THE OILY SMELL OF THE SEA, THE ROTTING TOMATOES.

THE CRANES
CRANES LIFTING UP OUT OF THE MARSHLAND…

MY BROTHER BRINGS HIS FINGERS TO HIS TEMPLES

AND THEN DROPS HIS HANDS.

LIKE THAT, HE WAS DEAD.

THE SATIN LINING OF AUTUMN.

O MY BROTHER! I MISS YOU NOW, AND I’D LIKE TO HAVE YOU BACK.

HUG YOU LIKE A GROWN MAN

WHO KNOWS THE WORTH OF THINGS.

THE MIST OF EVENTS DRIFTS AWAY.

NOT IN THIS LIFE, I TOLD YOU ONCE.

I WAS GIVEN A DIFFERENT SET OF MARCHING ORDERS.

I PLANNED TO GO MULE-BACKING ACROSS THE ISTHMUS.

BEGONE, THOUGH, IF THIS IS YOUR IDEA OF THINGS!

BUT I’LL THINK OF YOU OUT THERE

WHEN I LOOK AT THOSE STARS WE SAW AS CHILDREN.

THE CRANES WALLOP THEIR WINGS.

IN A MOMENT, THEY’LL FIND TRUE NORTH.

THEN TURN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

A HAIRCUT
SO MANY IMPOSSIBLE THINGS HAVE ALREADY

HAPPENED IN THIS LIFE. HE DOESN’T THINK

TWICE WHEN SHE TELLS HIM TO GET READY:

HE’S ABOUT TO GET A HAIRCUT.

HE SITS IN THE CHAIR IN THE UPSTAIRS ROOM,

THE ROOM THEY SOMETIMES JOKE AND REFER TO

AS THE LIBRARY. THERE’S A WINDOW THERE

THAT GIVES LIGHT. SNOW’S COMING

DOWN OUTSIDE AS NEWSPAPERS GO DOWN

AROUND HIS FEET. SHE DRAPES A BIG

TOWEL OVER HIS SHOULDERS. THEN

GETS OUT HER SCISSORS, COMB, AND BRUSH.

THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY’VE BEEN

ALONE TOGETHER IN A WHILE—WITH NOBODY

GOING ANYWHERE, OR NEEDING TO DO

ANYTHING. NOT COUNTING THE GOING

TO BED WITH EACH OTHER. THAT INTIMACY.

OR BREAKFASTING TOGETHER. ANOTHER

INTIMACY. THEY BOTH GROW QUIET

AND THOUGHTFUL AS SHE CUTS HIS HAIR,

AND COMBS IT, AND CUTS SOME MORE.

THE SNOW KEEPS FALLING OUTSIDE.

SOON, LIGHT BEGINS TO PULL AWAY FROM

THE WINDOW. HE STARES DOWN, LOST AND

MUSING, TRYING TO READ

SOMETHING FROM THE PAPER. SHE SAYS,

“RAISE YOUR HEAD.” AND HE DOES.

AND THEN SHE SAYS, “SEE WHAT YOU THINK

OF IT.” HE GOES TO LOOK

IN THE MIRROR, AND IT’S FINE.

IT’S JUST THE WAY HE LIKES IT,

AND HE TELLS HER SO.

IT’S LATER, WHEN HE TURNS ON THE

PORCHLIGHT, AND SHAKES OUT THE TOWEL

AND SEES THE CURLS AND SWATHS OF

WHITE AND DARK HAIR FLY OUT ONTO

THE SNOW AND STAY THERE,

THAT HE UNDERSTANDS SOMETHING: HE’S

GROWNUP NOW, A REAL, GROWNUP,

MIDDLE-AGED MAN. WHEN HE WAS A BOY,

GOING WITH HIS DAD TO THE BARBERSHOP,

OR EVEN LATER, A TEENAGER, HOW

COULD HE HAVE IMAGINED HIS LIFE

WOULD SOMEDAY ALLOW HIM THE PRIVILEGE OF

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN TO TRAVEL WITH,

AND SLEEP WITH, AND TAKE HIS BREAKFAST WITH?

NOT ONLY THAT—A WOMAN WHO WOULD

QUIETLY CUT HIS HAIR IN THE AFTERNOON

IN A DARK CITY THAT LAY UNDER SNOW

3000 MILES AWAY FROM WHERE HE’D STARTED.

A WOMAN WHO COULD LOOK AT HIM

ACROSS THE TABLE AND SAY,

“IT’S TIME TO PUT YOU IN THE BARBER’S

CHAIR. IT’S TIME SOMEBODY GAVE YOU

A HAIRCUT.”

HAPPINESS IN CORNWALL
HIS WIFE DIED, AND HE GREW OLD

BETWEEN THE GRAVEYARD AND HIS

FRONT DOOR. WALKED WITH A GAIT.

SHOULDERS BENT. HE LET HIS CLOTHES

GO, AND HIS LONG HAIR TURNED WHITE.

HIS CHILDREN FOUND HIM SOMEBODY.

A BIG MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN WITH

HEAVY SHOES WHO KNEW HOW TO

MOP, WAX, DUST, SHOP, AND CARRY IN

FIREWOOD. WHO COULD LIVE

IN A ROOM AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

PREPARE MEALS. AND SLOWLY,

SLOWLY BRING THE OLD MAN AROUND

TO LISTENING TO HER READ POETRY

IN THE EVENINGS IN FRONT OF

THE FIRE. TENNYSON, BROWNING,

SHAKESPEARE, DRINKWATER. MEN

WHOSE NAMES TAKE UP SPACE

ON THE PAGE. SHE WAS THE BUTLER,

COOK, HOUSEKEEPER. AND AFTER

A TIME, OH, NO ONE KNOWS OR CARES

WHEN, THEY BEGAN TO DRESS UP

ON SUNDAYS AND STROLL THROUGH TOWN.

SHE WITH HER ARM THROUGH HIS.

SMILING. HE PROUD AND HAPPY

AND WITH HIS HAND ON HERS.

NO ONE DENIED THEM

OR TRIED TO DIMINISH THIS

IN ANY WAY. HAPPINESS IS

A RARE THING! EVENINGS HE

LISTENED TO POETRY, POETRY, POETRY

IN FRONT OF THE FIRE.

COULDN’T GET ENOUGH OF THAT LIFE.

AFGHANISTAN
THE SAD MUSIC OF ROADS LINED WITH LARCHES.

THE FOREST IN THE DISTANCE RESTING UNDER SNOW.

THE KHYBER PASS. ALEXANDER THE GREAT.

HISTORY, AND LAPIS LAZULI.

NO BOOKS, NO PICTURES, NO KNICK-KNACKS PLEASE ME.

BUT SHE PLEASES ME. AND LAPIS LAZULI.

THAT BLUE STONE SHE WEARS ON HER DEAR FINGER.

THAT PLEASES ME EXCEEDINGLY.

THE BUCKET CLATTERS INTO THE WELL.

AND BRINGS UP WATER WITH A SWEET TASTE TO IT.

THE TOWPATH ALONG THE RIVER. THE FOOTPATH

THROUGH THE GROVE OF ALMONDS. MY LOVE

GOES EVERYWHERE IN HER SANDALS.

AND WEARS LAPIS LAZULI ON HER FINGER.

IN A MARINE LIGHT NEAR
SEQUIM, WASHINGTON
THE GREEN FIELDS WERE BEGINNING. AND THE TALL, WHITE

FARMHOUSES AFTER THE TIDAL FLATS AND THOSE LITTLE SAND CRABS

THAT WERE READY TO RUN, OR ELSE TURN AND SQUARE OFF, IF

WE MOVED THE ROCK THEY LIVED UNDER. THE LANGUOR

OF THAT SUBDUED AFTERNOON. THE BEAUTY OF DRIVING

THAT COUNTRY ROAD. TALKING OF PARIS, OUR PARIS.

AND THEN YOU FINDING THAT PLACE IN THE BOOK

AND READING TO ME ABOUT ANNA AKHMATOVA’S STAY THERE WITH MODIGLIANI.

THEM SITTING ON A BENCH IN THE LUXEMBOURG GARDENS

UNDER HIS ENORMOUS OLD BLACK UMBRELLA

RECITING VERLAINE TO EACH OTHER. BOTH OF THEM

“AS YET UNTOUCHED BY THEIR FUTURES.” WHEN

OUT IN THE FIELD WE SAW

A BARE-CHESTED YOUNG MAN WITH HIS TROUSERS ROLLED UP,

LIKE AN ANCIENT OARSMAN. HE LOOKED AT US WITHOUT CURIOSITY.

STOOD THERE AND GAZED INDIFFERENTLY.

THEN TURNED HIS BACK TO US AND WENT ON WITH HIS WORK.

AS WE PASSED LIKE A BEAUTIFUL BLACK SCYTHE

THROUGH THAT PERFECT LANDSCAPE.

EAGLES
IT WAS A SIXTEEN-INCH LING COD THAT THE EAGLE

DROPPED NEAR OUR FEET

AT THE TOP OF BAGLEY CREEK CANYON,

AT THE EDGE OF THE GREEN WOODS.

PUNCTURE MARKS IN THE SIDES OF THE FISH

WHERE THE BIRD GRIPPED WITH ITS TALONS!

THAT AND A PIECE TORN OUT OF THE FISH’S BACK.

LIKE AN OLD PAINTING RECALLED,

OR AN ANCIENT MEMORY COMING BACK,

THAT EAGLE FLEW WITH THE FISH FROM THE STRAIT

OF JUAN DE FUCA UP THE CANYON TO WHERE

THE WOODS BEGIN, AND WE STOOD WATCHING.

IT LOST THE FISH ABOVE OUR HEADS,

DROPPED FOR IT, MISSED IT, AND SOARED ON

OVER THE VALLEY WHERE WIND BEATS ALL DAY.

WE WATCHED IT KEEP GOING UNTIL IT WAS

A SPECK, THEN GONE. I PICKED UP

THE FISH. THAT MIRACULOUS LING COD.

CAME HOME FROM THE WALK AND —

WHY THE HELL NOT?—COOKED IT

LIGHTLY IN OIL AND ATE IT

WITH BOILED POTATOES AND PEAS AND BISCUITS.

OVER DINNER, TALKING ABOUT EAGLES

AND AN OLDER, FIERCER ORDER OF THINGS.

YESTERDAY, SNOW
YESTERDAY, SNOW WAS FALLING AND ALL WAS CHAOS.

I DON’T DREAM, BUT IN THE NIGHT I DREAMED

A MAN OFFERED ME SOME OF HIS WHISKEY.

I WIPED THE MOUTH OF THE BOTTLE

AND RAISED IT TO MY LIPS.

IT WAS LIKE ONE OF THOSE DREAMS OF FALLING

WHERE, THEY SAY, IF YOU DON’T WAKE UP

BEFORE YOU HIT THE GROUND,

YOU’LL DIE. I WOKE UP! SWEATING.

OUTSIDE, THE SNOW HAD QUIT.

BUT, MY GOD, IT LOOKED COLD. FEARSOME.

THE WINDOWS WERE ICE TO THE TOUCH

WHEN I TOUCHED THEM. I GOT BACK

IN BED AND LAY THERE THE REST OF THE NIGHT,

AFRAID I’D SLEEP AGAIN. AND FIND

MYSELF BACK IN THAT DREAM…

THE BOTTLE RISING TO MY LIPS.

THE INDIFFERENT MAN

WAITING FOR ME TO DRINK AND PASS IT ON AGAIN.

A SKEWED MOON HANGS ON UNTIL MORNING,

AND A BRILLIANT SUN.

BEFORE NOW, I NEVER KNEW WHAT IT MEANT

TO “SPRING OUT OF BED.”

    ALL DAY SNOW FLOPPING OFF ROOFS.

THE CRUNCH OF TIRES AND FOOTSTEPS.

NEXT DOOR, THERE’S AN OLD FELLOW SHOVELING.

EVERY SO OFTEN HE STOPS AND LEANS

ON HIS SHOVEL, AND RESTS, LETTING

HIS THOUGHTS GO WHERE THEY MAY.

STAYING HIS HEART.

THEN HE NODS AND GRIPS HIS SHOVEL.

GOES ON, YES. GOES ON.

READING SOMETHING IN
THE RESTAURANT
THIS MORNING I REMEMBERED THE YOUNG MAN

WITH HIS BOOK, READING AT A TABLE

BY THE WINDOW LAST NIGHT. READING

AMIDST THE COMING AND GOING OF DISHES

AND VOICES. NOW AND THEN HE LOOKED

UP AND PASSED HIS FINGER ACROSS

HIS LIPS, AS IF PONDERING SOMETHING,

OR QUIETING THE THOUGHTS INSIDE

HIS MIND, THE GOING

AND COMING INSIDE HIS MIND. THEN

HE LOWERED HIS HEAD AND WENT BACK

TO READING. THAT MEMORY

GETS INTO MY HEAD THIS MORNING

WITH THE MEMORY OF

THE GIRL WHO ENTERED THE RESTAURANT

THAT TIME LONG AGO AND STOOD SHAKING HER HAIR.

THEN SAT DOWN ACROSS FROM ME

WITHOUT TAKING HER COAT OFF.

I PUT DOWN WHATEVER BOOK IT WAS

I WAS READING, AND SHE AT ONCE

STARTED TO TELL ME THERE WAS

NOT A SNOWBALL’S CHANCE IN HELL

THIS THING WAS GOING TO FLY.

SHE KNEW IT. THEN I CAME AROUND

TO KNOWING IT. BUT IT WAS

HARD. THIS MORNING, MY SWEET,

YOU ASK ME WHAT’S NEW

IN THE WORLD. BUT MY CONCENTRATION

IS SHOT. AT THE TABLE NEXT

TO OURS A MAN LAUGHS AND LAUGHS

AND SHAKES HIS HEAD AT WHAT

ANOTHER FELLOW IS TELLING HIM.

BUT WHAT WAS THAT YOUNG MAN READING?

WHERE DID THAT WOMAN GO?

I’VE LOST MY PLACE. TELL ME WHAT IT IS

YOU WANTED TO KNOW.

A POEM NOT AGAINST SONGBIRDS
LIGHTEN UP, SONGBIRDS. GIVE ME A BREAK.

NO NEED TO CARRY ON THIS WAY,

EVEN IF IT IS MORNING. I NEED MORE SLEEP.

WHERE WERE YOU KEEPING YOURSELVES WHEN I WAS THIRTY?

WHEN THE HOUSE STAYED DARK AND QUIET ALL DAY,

AS IF SOMEBODY HAD DIED?

AND THIS SAME SOMEBODY, OR SOMEBODY ELSE,

COOKED A HUGE, MOROSE MEAL FOR THE SURVIVORS.

A MEAL THAT LASTED TEN YEARS.

GO ON, SWEETHEARTS. COME BACK IN AN HOUR,

MY FRIENDS. THEN I’LL BE WIDE AWAKE.

YOU’LL SEE. THIS TIME I CAN PROMISE.

LATE AFTERNOON, APRIL 8, 1984
A LITTLE SPORT-FISHING BOAT

    WALLOWING

IN THE ROUGH WATERS OF THE STRAIT.

I PUT THE GLASSES ON HIM.

OLD GUY IN A CANVAS HAT,

LOOKING GRIM. WORRIED,

AS HE SHOULD BE.

THE OTHER BOATS HAVE COME IN

LONG AGO, COUNTING

THEIR BLESSINGS.

THIS FISHERMAN

HAD TO BE CLEAR OUT TO GREEN POINT

WHERE GIANT HALIBUT SCHOOL.

WHEN THE WIND STRUCK!

SUCH FORCE IT BENT THE TREES

AND CAUSED THE WATER

TO STAND UP.

AS IT’S STANDING NOW.

BUT HE’LL MAKE IT!

IF HE KEEPS THE BOW INTO

THE WIND, AND IF HE’S LUCKY.

EVEN SO I LOOK UP

THE COAST GUARD EMERGENCY NUMBER.

BUT I DON’T USE IT.

I KEEP WATCHING—AN HOUR, MAYBE LESS —

WHO KNOWS WHAT PASSES

THROUGH HIS MIND, AND MINE,

IN THAT TIME?

THEN HE TURNS IN TO THE HARBOR,

WHERE AT ONCE IT GROWS CALMER.

TAKES OFF HIS HAT THEN AND WAVES IT

LIKE MAD—LIKE AN OLD-TIME COWBOY!

SOMETHING HE WON’T EVER FORGET.

YOU BETCHA.

    ME NEITHER.

MY WORK
I LOOK UP AND SEE THEM STARTING

DOWN THE BEACH. THE YOUNG MAN

IS WEARING A PACKBOARD TO CARRY THE BABY.

THIS LEAVES HIS HANDS FREE

SO THAT HE CAN TAKE ONE OF HIS WIFE’S HANDS

IN HIS, AND SWING HIS OTHER. ANYONE CAN SEE

HOW HAPPY THEY ARE. AND INTIMATE. HOW STEADY.

THEY ARE HAPPIER THAN ANYONE ELSE, AND THEY KNOW IT.

ARE GLADDENED BY IT, AND HUMBLED.

THEY WALK TO THE END OF THE BEACH

AND OUT OF SIGHT. THAT’S IT, I THINK,

AND RETURN TO THIS THING GOVERNING

MY LIFE. BUT IN A FEW MINUTES

THEY COME WALKING BACK ALONG THE BEACH.

THE ONLY THING DIFFERENT

IS THAT THEY HAVE CHANGED SIDES.

HE IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HER NOW,

THE OCEAN SIDE. SHE IS ON THIS SIDE.

BUT THEY ARE STILL HOLDING HANDS. EVEN MORE

IN LOVE, IF THAT’S POSSIBLE. AND IT IS.

HAVING BEEN THERE FOR A LONG TIME MYSELF.

THEIRS HAS BEEN A MODEST WALK, FIFTEEN MINUTES

DOWN THE BEACH, FIFTEEN MINUTES BACK.

THEY’VE HAD TO PICK THEIR WAY

OVER SOME ROCKS AND AROUND HUGE LOGS,

TOSSED UP FROM WHEN THE SEA RAN WILD.

THEY WALK QUIETLY, SLOWLY, HOLDING HANDS.

THEY KNOW THE WATER IS OUT THERE

BUT THEY’RE SO HAPPY THAT THEY IGNORE IT.

THE LOVE IN THEIR YOUNG FACES. THE SURROUND OF IT.

MAYBE IT WILL LAST FOREVER. IF THEY ARE LUCKY,

AND GOOD, AND FOREBEARING. AND CAREFUL. IF THEY

GO ON LOVING EACH OTHER WITHOUT STINT.

ARE TRUE TO EACH OTHER—THAT MOST OF ALL.

AS THEY WILL BE, OF COURSE, AS THEY WILL BE,

AS THEY KNOW THEY WILL BE.

I GO BACK TO MY WORK. MY WORK GOES BACK TO ME.

A WIND PICKS UP OUT OVER THE WATER.

THE TRESTLE
I’VE WASTED MY TIME THIS MORNING, AND I’M DEEPLY ASHAMED.

I WENT TO BED LAST NIGHT THINKING ABOUT MY DAD.

ABOUT THAT LITTLE RIVER WE USED TO FISH—BUTTE CREEK —

NEAR LAKE ALMANOR. WATER LULLED ME TO SLEEP.

IN MY DREAM, IT WAS ALL I COULD DO NOT TO GET UP

AND MOVE AROUND. BUT WHEN I WOKE EARLY THIS MORNING

I WENT TO THE TELEPHONE INSTEAD. EVEN THOUGH

THE RIVER WAS FLOWING DOWN THERE IN THE VALLEY,

IN THE MEADOWS, MOVING THROUGH DITCH CLOVER.

FIR TREES STOOD ON BOTH SIDES OF THE MEADOWS. AND I WAS THERE.

A KID SITTING ON A TIMBER TRESTLE, LOOKING DOWN.

WATCHING MY DAD DRINK FROM HIS CUPPED HANDS.

THEN HE SAID, “THIS WATER’S SO GOOD.

I WISH I COULD GIVE MY MOTHER SOME OF THIS WATER.”

MY DAD STILL LOVED HER, THOUGH SHE WAS DEAD

AND HE’D BEEN AWAY FROM HER FOR A LONG TIME.

HE HAD TO WAIT SOME MORE YEARS

UNTIL HE COULD GO WHERE SHE WAS. BUT HE LOVED

THIS COUNTRY WHERE HE FOUND HIMSELF. THE WEST.

FOR THIRTY YEARS IT HAD HIM AROUND THE HEART,

AND THEN IT LET HIM GO. HE WENT TO SLEEP ONE NIGHT

IN A TOWN IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA

AND DIDN’T WAKE UP. WHAT COULD BE SIMPLER?

I WISH MY OWN LIFE, AND DEATH, COULD BE SO SIMPLE.

SO THAT WHEN I WOKE ON A FINE MORNING LIKE THIS,

AFTER BEING SOMEWHERE I WANTED TO BE ALL NIGHT,

SOMEWHERE IMPORTANT, I COULD MOVE MOST NATURALLY

AND WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT, TO MY DESK.

SAY I DID THAT, IN THE SIMPLE WAY I’VE DESCRIBED.

FROM BED TO DESK BACK TO CHILDHOOD.

FROM THERE IT’S NOT SO FAR TO THE TRESTLE.

AND FROM THE TRESTLE I COULD LOOK DOWN

AND SEE MY DAD WHEN I NEEDED TO SEE HIM.

MY DAD DRINKING THAT COLD WATER. MY SWEET FATHER.

THE RIVER, ITS MEADOWS, AND FIRS, AND THE TRESTLE.

THAT. WHERE I ONCE STOOD.

I WISH I COULD DO THAT

WITHOUT HAVING TO PLEAD WITH MYSELF FOR IT.

AND FEEL SICK OF MYSELF

FOR GETTING INVOLVED IN LESSER THINGS.

I KNOW IT’S TIME I CHANGED MY LIFE.

THIS LIFE—THE ONE WITH ITS COMPLICATIONS

AND PHONE CALLS—IS UNBECOMING,

AND A WASTE OF TIME.

I WANT TO PLUNGE MY HANDS IN CLEAR WATER. THE WAY

HE DID. AGAIN AND THEN AGAIN.

FOR TESS
OUT ON THE STRAIT THE WATER IS WHITECAPPING,

AS THEY SAY HERE. IT’S ROUGH, AND I’M GLAD

I’M NOT OUT. GLAD I FISHED ALL DAY

ON MORSE CREEK, CASTING A RED DAREDEVIL BACK

AND FORTH. I DIDN’T CATCH ANYTHING. NO BITES

EVEN, NOT ONE. BUT IT WAS OKAY. IT WAS FINE!

I CARRIED YOUR DAD’S POCKETKNIFE AND WAS FOLLOWED

FOR A WHILE BY A DOG ITS OWNER CALLED DIXIE.

AT TIMES I FELT SO HAPPY I HAD TO QUIT

FISHING. ONCE I LAY ON THE BANK WITH MY EYES CLOSED,

LISTENING TO THE SOUND THE WATER MADE,

AND TO THE WIND IN THE TOPS OF THE TREES. THE SAME WIND

THAT BLOWS OUT ON THE STRAIT, BUT A DIFFERENT WIND, TOO.

FOR A WHILE I EVEN LET MYSELF IMAGINE I HAD DIED —

AND THAT WAS ALL RIGHT, AT LEAST FOR A COUPLE

OF MINUTES, UNTIL IT REALLY SANK IN: DEAD.

AS I WAS LYING THERE WITH MY EYES CLOSED,

JUST AFTER I’D IMAGINED WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE

IF IN FACT I NEVER GOT UP AGAIN, I THOUGHT OF YOU.

I OPENED MY EYES THEN AND GOT RIGHT UP

AND WENT BACK TO BEING HAPPY AGAIN.

I’M GRATEFUL TO YOU, YOU SEE. I WANTED TO TELL YOU.

ULTRAMARINE
                                                                …SICK

               WITH EXILE, THEY YEARN HOMEWARD NOW, THEIR EYES

               TUNED TO THE ULTRAMARINE, FIRST-STAR-PIERCED DARK

               REFLECTED ON THE DARK, INCOMING WAVES…

               — DEREK MAHON

               FROM “MT GABRIEL” IN ANTARCTICA (1985)


THIS MORNING
THIS MORNING WAS SOMETHING. A LITTLE SNOW

LAY ON THE GROUND. THE SUN FLOATED IN A CLEAR

BLUE SKY. THE SEA WAS BLUE, AND BLUE-GREEN,

AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD SEE.

SCARCELY A RIPPLE. CALM. I DRESSED AND WENT

FOR A WALK—DETERMINED NOT TO RETURN

UNTIL I TOOK IN WHAT NATURE HAD TO OFFER.

I PASSED CLOSE TO SOME OLD, BENT-OVER TREES.

CROSSED A FIELD STREWN WITH ROCKS

WHERE SNOW HAD DRIFTED. KEPT GOING

UNTIL I REACHED THE BLUFF.

WHERE I GAZED AT THE SEA, AND THE SKY, AND

THE GULLS WHEELING OVER THE WHITE BEACH

FAR BELOW. ALL LOVELY. ALL BATHED IN A PURE

COLD LIGHT. BUT, AS USUAL, MY THOUGHTS

BEGAN TO WANDER. I HAD TO WILL

MYSELF TO SEE WHAT I WAS SEEING

AND NOTHING ELSE. I HAD TO TELL MYSELF THIS IS WHAT

MATTERED, NOT THE OTHER. (AND I DID SEE IT,

FOR A MINUTE OR TWO!) FOR A MINUTE OR TWO

IT CROWDED OUT THE USUAL MUSINGS ON

WHAT WAS RIGHT, AND WHAT WAS WRONG—DUTY,

TENDER MEMORIES, THOUGHTS OF DEATH, HOW I SHOULD TREAT

WITH MY FORMER WIFE. ALL THE THINGS

I HOPED WOULD GO AWAY THIS MORNING.

THE STUFF I LIVE WITH EVERY DAY. WHAT

I’VE TRAMPLED ON IN ORDER TO STAY ALIVE.

BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO I DID FORGET

MYSELF AND EVERYTHING ELSE. I KNOW I DID.

FOR WHEN I TURNED BACK I DIDN’T KNOW

WHERE I WAS. UNTIL SOME BIRDS ROSE UP

FROM THE GNARLED TREES. AND FLEW

IN THE DIRECTION I NEEDED TO BE GOING.

WHAT YOU NEED FOR PAINTING
FROM A LETTER BY RENOIR


DON’T FORGET:

PALETTE KNIFE

SCRAPING KNIFE

ESSENCE OF TURPENTINE

BRUSHES?

POINTED MARTEN-HAIR BRUSHES

FLAT HOG-HAIR BRUSHES

INDIFFERENCE TO EVERYTHING EXCEPT YOUR CANVAS.

THE ABILITY TO WORK LIKE A LOCOMOTIVE.

AN IRON WILL.

AN AFTERNOON
AS HE WRITES, WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE SEA,

HE FEELS THE TIP OF HIS PEN BEGIN TO TREMBLE.

THE TIDE IS GOING OUT ACROSS THE SHINGLE.

BUT IT ISN’T THAT. NO,

IT’S BECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT SHE CHOOSES

TO WALK INTO THE ROOM WITHOUT ANY CLOTHES ON.

DROWSY, NOT EVEN SURE WHERE SHE IS

FOR A MOMENT. SHE WAVES THE HAIR FROM HER FOREHEAD.

SITS ON THE TOILET WITH HER EYES CLOSED,

HEAD DOWN. LEGS SPRAWLED. HE SEES HER

THROUGH THE DOORWAY. MAYBE

SHE’S REMEMBERING WHAT HAPPENED THAT MORNING.

FOR AFTER A TIME, SHE OPENS ONE EYE AND LOOKS AT HIM.

AND SWEETLY SMILES.

CIRCULATION
AND ALL AT LENGTH ARE GATHERED IN.

— LOUISE BOGAN

BY THE TIME I CAME AROUND TO FEELING PAIN

AND WOKE UP, MOONLIGHT

FLOODED THE ROOM. MY ARM LAY PARALYZED,

PROPPED LIKE AN OLD ANCHOR UNDER

YOUR BACK. YOU WERE IN A DREAM,

YOU SAID LATER, WHERE YOU’D ARRIVED

EARLY FOR THE DANCE. BUT AFTER

A MOMENT’S ANXIETY YOU WERE OKAY

BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY A SIDEWALK

SALE, AND THE SHOES YOU WERE WEARING,

OR NOT WEARING, WERE FINE FOR THAT.

“HELP ME,” I SAID. AND TRIED TO HOIST

MY ARM. BUT IT JUST LAY THERE, ACHING,

UNABLE TO RISE ON ITS OWN. EVEN AFTER

YOU SAID “WHAT IS IT? WHAT’S WRONG?”

IT STAYED PUT—DEAF, UNMOVED

BY ANY EXPRESSION OF FEAR OR AMAZEMENT.

WE SHOUTED AT IT, AND GREW AFRAID

WHEN IT DIDN’T ANSWER. “IT’S GONE TO SLEEP,”

I SAID, AND HEARING THOSE WORDS

KNEW HOW ABSURD THIS WAS. BUT

I COULDN’T LAUGH. SOMEHOW,

BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, WE MANAGED

TO RAISE IT. THIS CAN’T BE MY ARM

IS WHAT I KEPT THINKING AS

WE THUMPED IT, SQUEEZED IT, AND

PRODDED IT BACK TO LIFE. SHOOK IT

UNTIL THAT STINGING WENT AWAY.

WE SAID A FEW WORDS TO EACH OTHER.

I DON’T REMEMBER WHAT. WHATEVER

REASSURING THINGS PEOPLE

WHO LOVE EACH OTHER SAY TO EACH OTHER

GIVEN THE HOUR AND SUCH ODD

CIRCUMSTANCE. I DO REMEMBER

YOU REMARKED HOW IT WAS LIGHT

ENOUGH IN THE ROOM THAT YOU COULD SEE

CIRCLES UNDER MY EYES.

YOU SAID I NEEDED MORE REGULAR SLEEP,

AND I AGREED. EACH OF US WENT

TO THE BATHROOM, AND CLIMBED BACK IN BED

ON OUR RESPECTIVE SIDES.

PULLED THE COVERS UP. “GOOD NIGHT,”

YOU SAID, FOR THE SECOND TIME THAT NIGHT.

AND FELL ASLEEP. MAYBE

INTO THAT SAME DREAM, OR ELSE ANOTHER.

I LAY UNTIL DAYBREAK, HOLDING

BOTH ARMS FAST ACROSS MY CHEST.

WORKING MY FINGERS NOW AND THEN.

WHILE MY THOUGHTS KEPT CIRCLING

AROUND AND AROUND, BUT ALWAYS GOING BACK

WHERE THEY’D STARTED FROM.

THAT ONE INESCAPABLE FACT: EVEN WHILE

WE UNDERTAKE THIS TRIP,

THERE’S ANOTHER, FAR MORE BIZARRE,

WE STILL HAVE TO MAKE.

THE COBWEB
A FEW MINUTES AGO, I STEPPED ONTO THE DECK

OF THE HOUSE. FROM THERE I COULD SEE AND HEAR THE WATER,

AND EVERYTHING THAT’S HAPPENED TO ME ALL THESE YEARS.

IT WAS HOT AND STILL. THE TIDE WAS OUT.

NO BIRDS SANG. AS I LEANED AGAINST THE RAILING

A COBWEB TOUCHED MY FOREHEAD.

IT CAUGHT IN MY HAIR. NO ONE CAN BLAME ME THAT I TURNED

AND WENT INSIDE. THERE WAS NO WIND. THE SEA

WAS DEAD CALM. I HUNG THE COBWEB FROM THE LAMPSHADE.

WHERE I WATCH IT SHUDDER NOW AND THEN WHEN MY BREATH

TOUCHES IT. A FINE THREAD. INTRICATE.

BEFORE LONG, BEFORE ANYONE REALIZES,

I’LL BE GONE FROM HERE.

BALSA WOOD
MY DAD IS AT THE STOVE IN FRONT OF A PAN WITH BRAINS

AND EGGS. BUT WHO HAS ANY APPETITE

THIS MORNING? I FEEL FLIMSY AS

BALSA WOOD. SOMETHING HAS JUST BEEN SAID.

MY MOM SAID IT. WHAT WAS IT? SOMETHING,

I’LL BET, THAT BEARS ON MONEY. I’LL DO MY PART

IF I DON’T EAT. DAD TURNS HIS BACK ON THE STOVE.

“I’M IN A HOLE. DON’T DIG ME DEEPER.”

LIGHT LEAKS IN FROM THE WINDOW. SOMEONE’S CRYING.

THE LAST THING I RECALL IS THE SMELL

OF BURNED BRAINS AND EGGS. THE WHOLE MORNING

IS SHOVELED INTO THE GARBAGE AND MIXED

WITH OTHER THINGS. SOMETIME LATER

HE AND I DRIVE TO THE DUMP, TEN MILES OUT.

WE DON’T TALK. WE THROW OUR BAGS AND CARTONS

ONTO A DARK MOUND. RATS SCREECH.

THEY WHISTLE AS THEY CRAWL OUT OF ROTTEN SACKS

DRAGGING THEIR BELLIES. WE GET BACK IN THE CAR

TO WATCH THE SMOKE AND FIRE. THE MOTOR’S RUNNING.

I SMELL THE AIRPLANE GLUE ON MY FINGERS.

HE LOOKS AT ME AS I BRING MY FINGERS TO MY NOSE.

THEN LOOKS AWAY AGAIN, TOWARD TOWN.

HE WANTS TO SAY SOMETHING BUT CAN’T.

HE’S A MILLION MILES AWAY. WE’RE BOTH FAR AWAY

FROM THERE, AND STILL SOMEONE’S CRYING. EVEN THEN

I WAS BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT’S POSSIBLE

TO BE IN ONE PLACE. AND SOMEPLACE ELSE, TOO.

THE PROJECTILE
FOR HARUKI MURAKAMI

WE SIPPED TEA. POLITELY MUSING

ON POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THE SUCCESS

OF MY BOOKS IN YOUR COUNTRY. SLIPPED

INTO TALK OF PAIN AND HUMILIATION

YOU FIND OCCURRING, AND REOCCURRING,

IN MY STORIES. AND THAT ELEMENT

OF SHEER CHANCE. HOW ALL THIS TRANSLATES

IN TERMS OF SALES.

I LOOKED INTO A CORNER OF THE ROOM.

AND FOR A MINUTE I WAS 16 AGAIN,

CAREENING AROUND IN THE SNOW

IN A ’50 DODGE SEDAN WITH FIVE OR SIX

BOZOS. GIVING THE FINGER

TO SOME OTHER BOZOS, WHO YELLED AND PELTED

OUR CAR WITH SNOWBALLS, GRAVEL, OLD

TREE BRANCHES. WE SPUN AWAY, SHOUTING.

AND WE WERE GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT.

BUT MY WINDOW WAS DOWN THREE INCHES.

ONLY THREE INCHES. I HOLLERED OUT

ONE LAST OBSCENITY. AND SAW THIS GUY

WIND UP TO THROW. FROM THIS VANTAGE,

NOW, I IMAGINE I SEE IT COMING. SEE IT

SPEEDING THROUGH THE AIR WHILE I WATCH,

LIKE THOSE SOLDIERS IN THE FIRST PART

OF THE LAST CENTURY WATCHED CANISTERS

OF SHOT FLY IN THEIR DIRECTION

WHILE THEY STOOD, UNABLE TO MOVE

FOR THE DREAD FASCINATION OF IT.

BUT I DIDN’T SEE IT. I’D ALREADY TURNED

MY HEAD TO LAUGH WITH MY PALS.

WHEN SOMETHING SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE

OF MY HEAD SO HARD IT BROKE MY EARDRUM AND FELL

IN MY LAP, INTACT. A BALL OF PACKED ICE

AND SNOW. THE PAIN WAS STUPENDOUS.

AND THE HUMILIATION.

IT WAS AWFUL WHEN I BEGAN TO WEEP

IN FRONT OF THOSE TOUGH GUYS WHILE THEY

CRIED, DUMB LUCK. FREAK ACCIDENT.

A CHANCE IN A MILLION!

THE GUY WHO THREW IT, HE HAD TO BE AMAZED

AND PROUD OF HIMSELF WHILE HE TOOK

THE SHOUTS AND BACKSLAPS OF THE OTHERS.

HE MUST HAVE WIPED HIS HANDS ON HIS PANTS.

AND MESSED AROUND A LITTLE MORE

BEFORE GOING HOME TO SUPPER. HE GREW UP

TO HAVE HIS SHARE OF SETBACKS AND GOT LOST

IN HIS LIFE, SAME AS I GOT LOST IN MINE.

HE NEVER GAVE THAT AFTERNOON

ANOTHER THOUGHT. AND WHY SHOULD HE?

SO MUCH ELSE TO THINK ABOUT ALWAYS.

WHY REMEMBER THAT STUPID CAR SLIDING

DOWN THE ROAD, THEN TURNING THE CORNER

AND DISAPPEARING?

WE POLITELY RAISE OUR TEACUPS IN THE ROOM.

A ROOM THAT FOR A MINUTE SOMETHING ELSE ENTERED.

THE MAIL
ON MY DESK, A PICTURE POSTCARD FROM MY SON

IN SOUTHERN FRANCE. THE MIDI,

HE CALLS IT. BLUE SKIES. BEAUTIFUL HOUSES

LOADED WITH BEGONIAS. NEVERTHELESS

HE’S GOING UNDER, NEEDS MONEY FAST.

NEXT TO HIS CARD, A LETTER

FROM MY DAUGHTER TELLING ME HER OLD MAN,

THE SPEED-FREAK, IS TEARING DOWN

A MOTORCYCLE IN THE LIVING ROOM.

THEY’RE EXISTING ON OATMEAL,

SHE AND HER CHILDREN. FOR GOD’S SAKE,

SHE COULD USE SOME HELP.

AND THERE’S THE LETTER FROM MY MOTHER

WHO IS SICK AND LOSING HER MIND.

SHE TELLS ME SHE WON’T BE HERE

MUCH LONGER. WON’T I HELP HER MAKE

THIS ONE LAST MOVE? CAN’T I PAY

FOR HER TO HAVE A HOME OF HER OWN?

I GO OUTSIDE. THINKING TO WALK

TO THE GRAVEYARD FOR SOME COMFORT.

BUT THE SKY IS IN TURMOIL.

THE CLOUDS, HUGE AND SWOLLEN WITH DARKNESS,

ABOUT TO SPEW OPEN.

IT’S THEN THE POSTMAN TURNS INTO

THE DRIVE. HIS FACE

IS A REPTILE’S, GLISTENING AND WORKING.

HIS HAND GOES BACK—AS IF TO STRIKE!

IT’S THE MAIL.

THE AUTOPSY ROOM
THEN I WAS YOUNG AND HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN.

FOR ANYTHING, I THOUGHT. THOUGH PART OF MY JOB

AT NIGHT WAS TO CLEAN THE AUTOPSY ROOM

ONCE THE CORONER’S WORK WAS DONE. BUT NOW

AND THEN THEY KNOCKED OFF EARLY, OR TOO LATE.

FOR, SO HELP ME, THEY LEFT THINGS OUT

ON THEIR SPECIALLY BUILT TABLE. A LITTLE BABY,

STILL AS A STONE AND SNOW COLD. ANOTHER TIME,

A HUGE BLACK MAN WITH WHITE HAIR WHOSE CHEST

HAD BEEN LAID OPEN. ALL HIS VITAL ORGANS

LAY IN A PAN BESIDE HIS HEAD. THE HOSE

WAS RUNNING, THE OVERHEAD LIGHTS BLAZED.

AND ONE TIME THERE WAS A LEG, A WOMAN’S LEG,

ON THE TABLE. A PALE AND SHAPELY LEG.

I KNEW IT FOR WHAT IT WAS. I’D SEEN THEM BEFORE.

STILL, IT TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

WHEN I WENT HOME AT NIGHT MY WIFE WOULD SAY,

“SUGAR, IT’S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. WE’LL TRADE

THIS LIFE IN FOR ANOTHER.” BUT IT WASN’T

THAT EASY. SHE’D TAKE MY HAND BETWEEN HER HANDS

AND HOLD IT TIGHT, WHILE I LEANED BACK ON THE SOFA

AND CLOSED MY EYES. THINKING OF … SOMETHING.

I DON’T KNOW WHAT. BUT I’D LET HER BRING

MY HAND TO HER BREAST. AT WHICH POINT

I’D OPEN MY EYES AND STARE AT THE CEILING, OR ELSE

THE FLOOR. THEN MY FINGERS STRAYED TO HER LEG.

WHICH WAS WARM AND SHAPELY, READY TO TREMBLE

AND RAISE SLIGHTLY, AT THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH.

BUT MY MIND WAS UNCLEAR AND SHAKY. NOTHING

WAS HAPPENING. EVERYTHING WAS HAPPENING. LIFE

WAS A STONE, GRINDING AND SHARPENING.

WHERE THEY’D LIVED
EVERYWHERE HE WENT THAT DAY HE WALKED

IN HIS OWN PAST. KICKED THROUGH PILES

OF MEMORIES. LOOKED THROUGH WINDOWS

THAT NO LONGER BELONGED TO HIM.

WORK AND POVERTY AND SHORT CHANGE.

IN THOSE DAYS THEY’D LIVED BY THEIR WILLS,

DETERMINED TO BE INVINCIBLE.

NOTHING COULD STOP THEM. NOT

FOR THE LONGEST WHILE.

                                        IN THE MOTEL ROOM

THAT NIGHT, IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS,

HE OPENED A CURTAIN. SAW CLOUDS

BANKED AGAINST THE MOON. HE LEANED

CLOSER TO THE GLASS. COLD AIR PASSED

THROUGH AND PUT ITS HAND OVER HIS HEART.

I LOVED YOU, HE THOUGHT.

LOVED YOU WELL.

BEFORE LOVING YOU NO LONGER.

MEMORY [2]
SHE LAYS HER HAND ON HIS SHOULDER

AT THE CHECKOUT STAND. BUT HE WON’T

GO WITH HER, AND SHAKES HIS HEAD.

SHE INSISTS! HE PAYS. SHE WALKS OUT

WITH HIM TO HIS BIG CAR, TAKES ONE LOOK,

LAUGHS AT IT. TOUCHES HIS CHEEK.

LEAVES HIM WITH HIS GROCERIES

IN THE PARKING LOT. FEELING FOOLISH.

FEELING DIMINISHED. STILL PAYING.

STUPID
IT’S WHAT THE KIDS NOWADAYS CALL WEED. AND IT DRIFTS

LIKE CLOUDS FROM HIS LIPS. HE HOPES NO ONE

COMES ALONG TONIGHT, OR CALLS TO ASK FOR HELP.

HELP IS WHAT HE’S MOST SHORT ON TONIGHT.

A STORM THRASHES OUTSIDE. HEAVY SEAS

WITH GALE WINDS FROM THE WEST. THE TABLE HE SITS AT

IS, SAY, TWO CUBITS LONG AND ONE WIDE.

THE DARKNESS IN THE ROOM TEEMS WITH INSIGHT.

COULD BE HE’LL WRITE AN ADVENTURE NOVEL. OR ELSE

A CHILDREN’S STORY. A PLAY FOR TWO FEMALE CHARACTERS,

ONE OF WHOM IS BLIND. CUTTHROAT SHOULD BE COMING

INTO THE RIVER. ONE THING HE’LL DO IS LEARN

TO TIE HIS OWN FLIES. MAYBE HE SHOULD GIVE

MORE MONEY TO EACH OF HIS SURVIVING

FAMILY MEMBERS. THE ONES WHO ALREADY EXPECT A LITTLE

SOMETHING IN THE MAIL FIRST OF EACH MONTH.

EVERY TIME THEY WRITE THEY TELL HIM

THEY’RE COMING UP SHORT. HE COUNTS HEADS ON HIS FINGERS

AND FINDS THEY’RE ALL SURVIVING. SO WHAT

IF HE’D RATHER BE REMEMBERED IN THE DREAMS OF STRANGERS?

HE RAISES HIS EYES TO THE SKYLIGHTS WHERE RAIN

HAMMERS ON. AFTER A WHILE —

WHO KNOWS HOW LONG?—HIS EYES ASK

THAT THEY BE CLOSED. AND HE CLOSES THEM.

BUT THE RAIN KEEPS HAMMERING. IS THIS A CLOUDBURST?

SHOULD HE DO SOMETHING? SECURE THE HOUSE

IN SOME WAY? UNCLE BO STAYED MARRIED TO AUNT RUBY

FOR 47 YEARS. THEN HANGED HIMSELF.

HE OPENS HIS EYES AGAIN. NOTHING ADDS UP.

IT ALL ADDS UP. HOW LONG WILL THIS STORM GO ON?

UNION STREET: SAN FRANCISCO, SUMMER 1975
IN THOSE DAYS WE WERE GOING PLACES. BUT THAT SUNDAY

AFTERNOON WE WERE BECALMED. SITTING AROUND A TABLE,

DRINKING AND SWAPPING STORIES. A PARTY THAT’D BEEN

GOING ON, AND OFF, SINCE FRIDAY A YEAR AGO.

THEN GUY’S WIFE WAS DROPPED OFF IN FRONT OF THE APARTMENT

BY HER BOYFRIEND, AND CAME UPSTAIRS.

IT’S GUY’S BIRTHDAY, AFTER ALL, GIVE OR TAKE A DAY.

THEY HAVEN’T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR A WEEK,

MORE OR LESS. SHE’S ALL DRESSED UP. HE EMBRACES HER,

SORT OF, MAKES HER A DRINK. FINDS A PLACE

FOR HER AT THE TABLE. EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW

HOW SHE IS, ETC. BUT SHE IGNORES THEM ALL.

ALL THOSE ALCOHOLICS. CLEARLY, SHE’S PISSED OFF

AND AS USUAL IN THE WRONG COMPANY.

WHERE THE HELL HAS GUY BEEN KEEPING HIMSELF?

SHE WANTS TO KNOW. SHE SIPS HER DRINK AND LOOKS AT HIM

AS IF HE’S BRAIN-DAMAGED. SHE SPOTS A PIMPLE

ON HIS CHIN; IT’S AN INGROWN HAIR BUT IT’S FILLED

WITH PUS, FRIGHTFUL, LOOKS LIKE HELL. IN FRONT

OF EVERYONE SHE SAYS, “WHO HAVE YOU BEEN EATING OUT

LATELY?” STARING HARD AT HIS PIMPLE.

BEING DRUNK MYSELF, I DON’T RECALL HOW HE ANSWERED.

MAYBE HE SAID, “I DON’T REMEMBER WHO IT WAS;

I DIDN’T GET HER NAME.” SOMETHING SMART.

ANYWAY, HIS WIFE HAS THIS KIND OF BLISTERY RASH,

MAYBE IT’S COLD SORES, AT THE EDGE OF HER MOUTH,

SO SHE SHOULDN’T BE TALKING. PRETTY SOON,

IT’S LIKE ALWAYS: THEY’RE HOLDING HANDS AND LAUGHING

LIKE THE REST OF US, AT LITTLE OR NOTHING.

                         LATER, IN THE LIVING ROOM,

THINKING EVERYONE HAD GONE OUT FOR HAMBURGERS,

SHE BLEW HIM IN FRONT OF THE TV. THEN SAID,

“HAPPY BIRTHDAY, YOU SON OF A BITCH!” AND SLAPPED HIS

GLASSES OFF. THE GLASSES HE’D BEEN WEARING

WHILE SHE MADE LOVE TO HIM. I WALKED INTO THE ROOM

AND SAID, “FRIENDS, DON’T DO THIS TO EACH OTHER.”

SHE DIDN’T FLINCH A MUSCLE OR WONDER ALOUD

WHICH ROCK I’D COME OUT FROM UNDER. ALL SHE SAID WAS

“WHO ASKED YOU, HOBO-URINE?” GUY PUT HIS GLASSES ON.

PULLED HIS TROUSERS UP. WE ALL WENT OUT

TO THE KITCHEN AND HAD A DRINK. THEN ANOTHER. LIKE THAT,

THE WORLD HAD GONE FROM AFTERNOON TO NIGHT.

BONNARD’S NUDES
HIS WIFE. FORTY YEARS HE PAINTED HER.

AGAIN AND AGAIN. THE NUDE IN THE LAST PAINTING

THE SAME YOUNG NUDE AS THE FIRST. HIS WIFE.

AS HE REMEMBERED HER YOUNG. AS SHE WAS YOUNG.

HIS WIFE IN HER BATH. AT HER DRESSING TABLE

IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR. UNDRESSED.

HIS WIFE WITH HER HANDS UNDER HER BREASTS

LOOKING OUT ON THE GARDEN.

THE SUN BESTOWING WARMTH AND COLOR.

EVERY LIVING THING IN BLOOM THERE.

SHE YOUNG AND TREMULOUS AND MOST DESIRABLE.

WHEN SHE DIED, HE PAINTED A WHILE LONGER.

A FEW LANDSCAPES. THEN DIED.

AND WAS PUT DOWN NEXT TO HER.

HIS YOUNG WIFE.

JEAN’S TV
MY LIFE’S ON AN EVEN KEEL

THESE DAYS. THOUGH WHO’S TO SAY

IT’LL NEVER WAVER AGAIN?

THIS MORNING I RECALLED

A GIRLFRIEND I HAD JUST AFTER

MY MARRIAGE BROKE UP.

A SWEET GIRL NAMED JEAN.

IN THE BEGINNING, SHE HAD NO IDEA

HOW BAD THINGS WERE. IT TOOK

A WHILE. BUT SHE LOVED ME

A BUNCH ANYWAY, SHE SAID.

AND I KNOW THAT’S TRUE.

SHE LET ME STAY AT HER PLACE

WHERE I CONDUCTED

THE SHABBY BUSINESS OF MY LIFE

OVER HER PHONE. SHE BOUGHT

MY BOOZE, BUT TOLD ME

I WASN’T A DRUNK

LIKE THOSE OTHERS SAID.

SIGNED CHECKS FOR ME

AND LEFT THEM ON HER PILLOW

WHEN SHE WENT OFF TO WORK.

GAVE ME A PENDLETON JACKET

THAT CHRISTMAS, ONE I STILL WEAR.

FOR MY PART, I TAUGHT HER TO DRINK.

AND HOW TO FALL ASLEEP

WITH HER CLOTHES ON.

HOW TO WAKE UP

WEEPING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

WHEN I LEFT, SHE PAID TWO MONTHS’

RENT FOR ME. AND GAVE ME

HER BLACK AND WHITE TV.

WE TALKED ON THE PHONE ONCE,

MONTHS LATER. SHE WAS DRUNK.

AND, SURE, I WAS DRUNK TOO.

THE LAST THING SHE SAID TO ME WAS,

WILL I EVER SEE MY TV AGAIN?

I LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM

AS IF THE TV MIGHT SUDDENLY

APPEAR IN ITS PLACE

ON THE KITCHEN CHAIR. OR ELSE

COME OUT OF A CUPBOARD

AND DECLARE ITSELF. BUT THAT TV

HAD GONE DOWN THE ROAD

WEEKS BEFORE. THE TV JEAN GAVE ME.

I DIDN’T TELL HER THAT.

I LIED, OF COURSE. SOON, I SAID,

VERY SOON NOW.

AND PUT DOWN THE PHONE

AFTER, OR BEFORE, SHE HUNG UP.

BUT THOSE SLEEP-SOUNDING WORDS

OF MINE MAKING ME FEEL

I’D COME TO THE END OF A STORY.

AND NOW, THIS ONE LAST FALSEHOOD

BEHIND ME,

                         I COULD REST.

MESOPOTAMIA
WAKING BEFORE SUNRISE, IN A HOUSE NOT MY OWN,

I HEAR A RADIO PLAYING IN THE KITCHEN.

MIST DRIFTS OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WHILE

A WOMAN’S VOICE GIVES THE NEWS, AND THEN THE WEATHER.

I HEAR THAT, AND THE SOUND OF MEAT

AS IT CONNECTS WITH HOT GREASE IN THE PAN.

I LISTEN SOME MORE, HALF ASLEEP. IT’S LIKE,

BUT NOT LIKE, WHEN I WAS A CHILD AND LAY IN BED,

IN THE DARK, LISTENING TO A WOMAN CRYING,

AND A MAN’S VOICE RAISED IN ANGER, OR DESPAIR,

THE RADIO PLAYING ALL THE WHILE. INSTEAD,

WHAT I HEAR THIS MORNING IS THE MAN OF THE HOUSE

SAYING “HOW MANY SUMMERS DO I HAVE LEFT?

ANSWER ME THAT.” THERE’S NO ANSWER FROM THE WOMAN

THAT I CAN HEAR. BUT WHAT COULD SHE ANSWER,

GIVEN SUCH A QUESTION? IN A MINUTE,

I HEAR HIS VOICE SPEAKING OF SOMEONE WHO I THINK

MUST BE LONG GONE: “THAT MAN COULD SAY,

    ‘O, MESOPOTAMIA!’

AND MOVE HIS AUDIENCE TO TEARS.”

I GET OUT OF BED AT ONCE AND DRAW ON MY PANTS.

ENOUGH LIGHT IN THE ROOM THAT I CAN SEE

WHERE I AM, FINALLY. I’M A GROWN MAN, AFTER ALL,

AND THESE PEOPLE ARE MY FRIENDS. THINGS

ARE NOT GOING WELL FOR THEM JUST NOW. OR ELSE

THEY’RE GOING BETTER THAN EVER

BECAUSE THEY’RE UP EARLY AND TALKING

ABOUT SUCH THINGS OF CONSEQUENCE

AS DEATH AND MESOPOTAMIA. IN ANY CASE,

I FEEL MYSELF BEING DRAWN TO THE KITCHEN.

SO MUCH THAT IS MYSTERIOUS AND IMPORTANT

IS HAPPENING OUT THERE THIS MORNING.

THE JUNGLE
“I ONLY HAVE TWO HANDS,”

THE BEAUTIFUL FLIGHT ATTENDANT

SAYS. SHE CONTINUES

UP THE AISLE WITH HER TRAY AND

OUT OF HIS LIFE FOREVER,

HE THINKS. OFF TO HIS LEFT,

FAR BELOW, SOME LIGHTS

FROM A VILLAGE HIGH

ON A HILL IN THE JUNGLE.

SO MANY IMPOSSIBLE THINGS

HAVE HAPPENED,

HE ISN’T SURPRISED WHEN SHE

RETURNS TO SIT IN THE

EMPTY SEAT ACROSS FROM HIS.

“ARE YOU GETTING OFF

IN RIO, OR GOING ON TO BUENOS AIRES?”

ONCE MORE SHE EXPOSES

HER BEAUTIFUL HANDS.

THE HEAVY SILVER RINGS THAT HOLD

HER FINGERS, THE GOLD BRACELET

ENCIRCLING HER WRIST.

THEY ARE SOMEWHERE IN THE AIR

OVER THE STEAMING MATO GROSSO.

IT IS VERY LATE.

HE GOES ON CONSIDERING HER HANDS.

LOOKING AT HER CLASPED FINGERS.

IT’S MONTHS AFTERWARDS, AND

HARD TO TALK ABOUT.

HOPE
“MY WIFE,” SAID PINNEGAR, “EXPECTS TO SEE ME GO TO THE DOGS
WHEN SHE LEAVES ME. IT IS HER LAST HOPE.”

— D. H. LAWRENCE,
“JIMMY AND THE DESPERATE WOMAN”

SHE GAVE ME THE CAR AND TWO

HUNDRED DOLLARS. SAID, SO LONG, BABY.

TAKE IT EASY, HEAR? SO MUCH

FOR TWENTY YEARS OF MARRIAGE.

SHE KNOWS, OR THINKS SHE KNOWS,

I’LL GO THROUGH THE DOUGH

IN A DAY OR TWO, AND EVENTUALLY

WRECK THE CAR—WHICH WAS

IN MY NAME AND NEEDED WORK ANYWAY.

WHEN I DROVE OFF, SHE AND HER BOY-

FRIEND WERE CHANGING THE LOCK

ON THE FRONT DOOR. THEY WAVED.

I WAVED BACK TO LET THEM KNOW

I DIDN’T THINK ANY THE LESS

OF THEM. THEN SPED TOWARD

THE STATE LINE. I WAS HELL-BENT.

SHE WAS RIGHT TO THINK SO.

I WENT TO THE DOGS, AND WE

BECAME GOOD FRIENDS.

BUT I KEPT GOING. WENT

A LONG WAY WITHOUT STOPPING.

LEFT THE DOGS, MY FRIENDS, BEHIND.

NEVERTHELESS, WHEN I DID SHOW

MY FACE AT THAT HOUSE AGAIN,

MONTHS, OR YEARS, LATER, DRIVING

A DIFFERENT CAR, SHE WEPT

WHEN SHE SAW ME AT THE DOOR.

SOBER. DRESSED IN A CLEAN SHIRT,

PANTS, AND BOOTS. HER LAST HOPE

BLASTED.

SHE DIDN’T HAVE A THING

TO HOPE FOR ANYMORE.

THE HOUSE BEHIND THIS ONE
THE AFTERNOON WAS ALREADY DARK AND UNNATURAL.

WHEN THIS OLD WOMAN APPEARED IN THE FIELD,

IN THE RAIN, CARRYING A BRIDLE.

SHE CAME UP THE ROAD TO THE HOUSE.

THE HOUSE BEHIND THIS ONE. SOMEHOW

SHE KNEW ANTONIO RÍOS HAD ENTERED

THE HOUR OF HIS FINAL COMBAT.

SOMEHOW, DON’T ASK ME HOW, SHE KNEW.

THE DOCTOR AND SOME OTHER PEOPLE WERE WITH HIM.

BUT NOTHING MORE COULD BE DONE. AND SO

THE OLD WOMAN CARRIED THE BRIDLE INTO THE ROOM,

AND HUNG IT ACROSS THE FOOT OF HIS BED.

THE BED WHERE HE WRITHED AND LAY DYING.

SHE WENT AWAY WITHOUT A WORD.

THIS WOMAN WHO’D ONCE BEEN YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.

WHEN ANTONIO WAS YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.

LIMITS
ALL THAT DAY WE BANGED AT GEESE

FROM A BLIND AT THE TOP

OF THE BLUFF. BUSTED ONE FLOCK

AFTER THE OTHER, UNTIL OUR GUN BARRELS

GREW HOT TO THE TOUCH. GEESE

FILLED THE COLD, GREY AIR. BUT WE STILL

DIDN’T KILL OUR LIMITS.

THE WIND DRIVING OUR SHOT

EVERY WHICHWAY. LATE AFTERNOON,

AND WE HAD FOUR. TWO SHY

OF OUR LIMITS. THIRST DROVE US

OFF THE BLUFF AND DOWN A DIRT ROAD

ALONGSIDE THE RIVER.

TO AN EVIL-LOOKING FARM

SURROUNDED BY DEAD FIELDS OF

BARLEY. WHERE, ALMOST EVENING,

A MAN WITH PATCHES OF SKIN

GONE FROM HIS HANDS LET US DIP WATER

FROM A BUCKET ON HIS PORCH.

THEN ASKED IF WE WANTED TO SEE

SOMETHING—A CANADA GOOSE HE KEPT

ALIVE IN A BARREL BESIDE

THE BARN. THE BARREL COVERED OVER

WITH SCREEN WIRE, RIGGED INSIDE

LIKE A LITTLE CELL. HE’D BROKEN

THE BIRD’S WING WITH A LONG SHOT,

HE SAID, THEN CHASED IT DOWN

AND STUFFED IT IN THE BARREL.

HE’D HAD A BRAINSTORM!

HE’D USE THAT GOOSE AS A LIVE DECOY.

IN TIME IT TURNED OUT TO BE

THE DAMNEDEST THING HE’D EVER SEEN.

IT WOULD BRING OTHER GEESE

RIGHT DOWN ON YOUR HEAD.

SO CLOSE YOU COULD ALMOST TOUCH THEM

BEFORE YOU KILLED THEM.

THIS MAN, HE NEVER WANTED FOR GEESE.

AND FOR THIS HIS GOOSE WAS GIVEN

ALL THE CORN AND BARLEY

IT COULD EAT, AND A BARREL

TO LIVE IN, AND SHIT IN.

I TOOK A GOOD LONG LOOK AND,

UNMOVING, THE GOOSE LOOKED BACK.

ONLY ITS EYES TELLING ME

IT WAS ALIVE. THEN WE LEFT,

MY FRIEND AND I. STILL

WILLING TO KILL ANYTHING

THAT MOVED, ANYTHING THAT ROSE

OVER OUR SIGHTS. I DON’T

RECALL IF WE GOT ANYTHING ELSE

THAT DAY. I DOUBT IT.

IT WAS ALMOST DARK ANYHOW.

NO MATTER, NOW. BUT FOR YEARS

AND YEARS AFTERWARDS, LIVING

ON A STAPLE OF BITTERNESS, I

DIDN’T FORGET THAT GOOSE.

I SET IT APART FROM ALL THE OTHERS,

LIVING AND DEAD. CAME TO UNDERSTAND

ONE CAN GET USED TO ANYTHING,

AND BECOME A STRANGER TO NOTHING.

SAW THAT BETRAYAL IS JUST ANOTHER WORD

FOR LOSS, FOR HUNGER.

THE SENSITIVE GIRL
THIS IS THE FOURTH DAY I’VE BEEN HERE.

BUT, NO JOKE, THERE’S A SPIDER

ON THIS PANE OF GLASS

THAT’S BEEN AROUND EVEN LONGER. IT DOESN’T

MOVE, BUT I KNOW IT’S ALIVE.

FINE WITH ME THAT LIGHTS ARE COMING ON

IN THE VALLEYS. IT’S PRETTY HERE,

AND QUIET. CATTLE ARE BEING DRIVEN HOME.

IF I LISTEN, I CAN HEAR COWBELLS

AND THEN THE SLAP-SLAP OF THE DRIVER’S

STICK. THERE’S HAZE

OVER THESE LUMPY SWISS HILLS. BELOW THE HOUSE,

A RACE OF WATER THROUGH THE ALDERS.

JETS OF WATER TOSSED UP,

SWEET AND HOPEFUL.

THERE WAS A TIME

I WOULD’VE DIED FOR LOVE.

NO MORE. THAT CENTER WOULDN’T HOLD.

IT COLLAPSED. IT GIVES OFF

NO LIGHT. ITS ORBIT

AN ORBIT OF WEARINESS. BUT I WORRY

THAT TIME AND WISH I KNEW WHY.

WHO WANTS TO REMEMBER

WHEN POVERTY AND DISGRACE PUSHED

THROUGH THE DOOR, FOLLOWED BY A COP

TO INVEST THE SCENE

WITH HORRIBLE AUTHORITY?

THE LATCH WAS FASTENED, BUT

THAT NEVER STOPPED ANYBODY BACK THEN.

HEY, NO ONE BREATHED IN THOSE DAYS.

ASK HER, IF YOU DON’T BELIEVE ME!

ASSUMING YOU COULD FIND HER AND

MAKE HER TALK. THAT GIRL WHO DREAMED

AND SANG. WHO SOMETIMES HUMMED

WHEN SHE MADE LOVE. THE SENSITIVE GIRL.

THE ONE WHO CRACKED.

I’M A GROWN MAN NOW, AND THEN SOME.

SO HOW MUCH LONGER DO I HAVE?

HOW MUCH LONGER FOR THAT SPIDER?

WHERE WILL HE GO, TWO DAYS INTO FALL,

THE LEAVES DROPPING?

THE CATTLE HAVE ENTERED THEIR PEN.

THE MAN WITH THE STICK RAISES HIS ARM.

THEN CLOSES AND FASTENS THE GATE.

I FIND MYSELF, AT LAST, IN PERFECT SILENCE.

KNOWING THE LITTLE THAT IS LEFT.

KNOWING I HAVE TO LOVE IT.

WANTING TO LOVE IT. FOR BOTH OUR SAKE.

THE MINUET
BRIGHT MORNINGS.

DAYS WHEN I WANT SO MUCH I WANT NOTHING.

JUST THIS LIFE, AND NO MORE. STILL,

I HOPE NO ONE COMES ALONG.

BUT IF SOMEONE DOES, I HOPE IT’S HER.

THE ONE WITH THE LITTLE DIAMOND STARS

AT THE TOES OF HER SHOES.

THE GIRL I SAW DANCE THE MINUET.

THAT ANTIQUE DANCE.

THE MINUET. SHE DANCED THAT

THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DANCED.

AND THE WAY SHE WANTED.

EGRESS
I OPENED THE OLD SPIRAL NOTEBOOK TO SEE WHAT I’D BEEN

THINKING IN THOSE DAYS. THERE WAS ONE ENTRY,

IN A HAND I DIDN’T RECOGNIZE AS MINE, BUT WAS MINE.

ALL THAT PAPER I’D LET GO TO WASTE BACK THEN!

REMOVING THE DOOR FOR DR KURBITZ.

WHAT ON EARTH COULD THAT POSSIBLY MEAN TO ME,

OR ANYONE, TODAY? THEN I WENT BACK

TO THAT TIME. TO JUST AFTER BEING MARRIED. HOW I EARNED

OUR DAILY BREAD DELIVERING FOR AL KURBITZ,

THE PHARMACIST. WHOSE BROTHER KEN—DR KURBITZ

TO ME, THE EAR-NOSE-AND-THROAT MAN—FELL DEAD

ONE NIGHT AFTER DINNER, AFTER

TALKING OVER SOME BUSINESS DEAL. HE DIED IN THE BATHROOM,

HIS BODY WEDGED BETWEEN THE DOOR AND TOILET STOOL.

BLOCKING THE WAY. FIRST THE WHUMP

OF A BODY HITTING THE FLOOR, AND THEN MR KURBITZ

AND HIS SNAZZY SISTER-IN-LAW SHOUTING “KEN! KEN!”

AND PUSHING ON THE BATHROOM DOOR.

MR KURBITZ HAD TO TAKE THE DOOR OFF ITS HINGES

WITH A SCREWDRIVER. IT SAVED THE AMBULANCE DRIVERS

A MINUTE, MAYBE. HE SAID HIS BROTHER NEVER KNEW

WHAT HIT HIM. DEAD BEFORE HE HIT THE FLOOR.

SINCE THEN, I’VE SEEN DOORS REMOVED FROM THEIR HINGES

MANY TIMES, WITH AND WITHOUT THE AID OF SCREWDRIVERS.

BUT I’D FORGOTTEN ABOUT DR KURBITZ, AND SO MUCH ELSE

FROM THAT TIME. NEVER, UNTIL TODAY, DID I CONNECT

THIS ACT WITH DYING.

                                        IN THOSE DAYS, DEATH,

IF IT HAPPENED, HAPPENED TO OTHERS. OLD PEOPLE

BELONGING TO MY PARENTS. OR ELSE PEOPLE OF CONSEQUENCE.

PEOPLE IN A DIFFERENT INCOME BRACKET, WHOSE DEATH

AND REMOVAL HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH ME, OR MINE.

WE WERE LIVING IN DR COGLON’S BASEMENT

APARTMENT, AND I WAS IN LOVE FOR THE FIRST TIME

EVER. MY WIFE WAS PREGNANT. WE WERE THRILLED

BEYOND MEASURE OR ACCOUNTING FOR, GIVEN OUR MEAN

SURROUNDINGS. AND THAT, I’M SAYING, MAY BE WHY

I NEVER WROTE MORE ABOUT DR KURBITZ,

HIS BROTHER AL, OR DOORS THAT HAD TO BE TAKEN OFF

THEIR HINGES FOR THE SAKE OF DEAD PEOPLE.

WHAT THE HELL! WHO NEEDED DEATH AND NOTEBOOKS? WE

WERE YOUNG AND HAPPY. DEATH WAS COMING, SURE.

BUT FOR THE OLD AND WORN-OUT. OR ELSE PEOPLE IN BOOKS.

AND, ONCE IN A WHILE, THE WELL-HEELED PROFESSIONALS

I TREMBLED BEFORE AND SAID “YES, SIR” TO.

SPELL
BETWEEN FIVE AND SEVEN THIS EVENING,

I LAY IN THE CHANNEL OF SLEEP. ATTACHED

TO THIS WORLD BY NOTHING MORE THAN HOPE,

I TURNED IN A CURRENT OF DARK DREAMS.

IT WAS DURING THIS TIME THE WEATHER

UNDERWENT A METAMORPHOSIS.

BECAME DERANGED. WHAT BEFORE HAD BEEN

VILE AND SHABBY, BUT COMPREHENSIBLE,

BECAME SWOLLEN AND

UNRECOGNIZABLE. SOMETHING UTTERLY VICIOUS.

IN MY DESPAIRING MOOD, I DIDN’T

NEED IT. IT WAS THE LAST THING ON EARTH

I WANTED. SO WITH ALL THE POWER I COULD MUSTER,

I SENT IT PACKING. SENT IT DOWN THE COAST

TO A BIG RIVER I KNOW ABOUT. A RIVER

ABLE TO DEAL WITH FOUL WEATHER

LIKE THIS. SO WHAT IF THE RIVER HAS TO FLEE

TO HIGHER GROUND? GIVE IT A FEW DAYS.

IT’LL FIND ITS WAY.

THEN ALL WILL BE AS BEFORE. I SWEAR

THIS WON’T BE MORE THAN A BAD MEMORY, IF THAT.

WHY, THIS TIME NEXT WEEK I WON’T REMEMBER

WHAT I WAS FEELING WHEN I WROTE THIS.

I’LL HAVE FORGOTTEN I SLEPT BADLY

AND DREAMED FOR A TIME THIS EVENING…

TO WAKE AT SEVEN O’CLOCK, LOOK OUT

AT THE STORM AND, AFTER THAT FIRST SHOCK —

TAKE HEART. THINK LONG AND HARD

ABOUT WHAT I WANT, WHAT I COULD LET GO

OR SEND AWAY. AND THEN DO IT!

LIKE THAT. WITH WORDS, AND SIGNS.

FROM THE EAST, LIGHT
THE HOUSE ROCKED AND SHOUTED ALL NIGHT.

TOWARD MORNING, GREW QUIET. THE CHILDREN,

LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO EAT, MAKE

THEIR WAY THROUGH THE CRAZY LIVING ROOM

IN ORDER TO GET TO THE CRAZY KITCHEN.

THERE’S FATHER, ASLEEP ON THE COUCH.

SURE THEY STOP TO LOOK. WHO WOULDN’T?

THEY LISTEN TO HIS VIOLENT SNORES

AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE OLD WAY OF LIFE

HAS BEGUN ONCE MORE. SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

BUT THE REAL SHOCKER, WHAT MAKES THEM STARE,

IS THAT THEIR CHRISTMAS TREE HAS BEEN TURNED OVER.

IT LIES ON ITS SIDE IN FRONT OF THE FIREPLACE.

THE TREE THEY HELPED DECORATE.

IT’S WRECKED NOW, ICICLES AND CANDY CANES

LITTER THE RUG. HOW’D A THING LIKE THIS HAPPEN, ANYWAY?

AND THEY SEE FATHER HAS OPENED

HIS PRESENT FROM MOTHER. IT’S A LENGTH OF ROPE

HALF-IN, HALF-OUT OF ITS PRETTY BOX.

LET THEM BOTH GO HANG

THEMSELVES, IS WHAT THEY’D LIKE TO SAY.

TO HELL WITH IT, AND

THEM, IS WHAT THEY’RE THINKING. MEANWHILE,

THERE’S CEREAL IN THE CUPBOARD, MILK

IN THE FRIDGE. THEY TAKE THEIR BOWLS

IN WHERE THE TV IS, FIND THEIR SHOW,

TRY TO FORGET ABOUT THE MESS EVERYWHERE.

UP GOES THE VOLUME. LOUDER, AND THEN LOUDER.

FATHER TURNS OVER AND GROANS. THE CHILDREN LAUGH.

THEY TURN IT UP SOME MORE SO HE’LL FOR SURE KNOW

HE’S ALIVE. HE RAISES HIS HEAD. MORNING BEGINS.

A TALL ORDER
THIS OLD WOMAN WHO KEPT HOUSE FOR THEM,

SHE’D SEEN AND HEARD THE MOST AMAZING THINGS.

SIGHTS LIKE PLATES AND BOTTLES FLYING.

AN ASHTRAY TRAVELING LIKE A MISSILE

THAT HIT THE DOG IN THE HEAD.

ONCE SHE LET HERSELF IN AND FOUND A HUGE

SALAD IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DINING-ROOM TABLE.

IT WAS SPRINKLED WITH MOLDY CROUTONS.

THE TABLE WAS SET FOR SIX, BUT NOBODY

HAD EATEN. DUST FILMED THE CUPS AND SILVER.

UPSTAIRS A MAN PLEADED

NOT TO HAVE HIS HAIR PULLED BY THE ROOTS AGAIN.

PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE HE CRIED.

HER JOB WAS TO SET THE HOUSE IN ORDER.

AT LEAST MAKE IT LIKE SHE’D LEFT IT LAST TIME.

THAT WAS ALL. NOBODY ASKED HER OPINION,

AND SHE DIDN’T GIVE IT. SHE PUT ON HER APRON.

TURNED THE HOT WATER ON FULL, DROWNING OUT

THAT OTHER SOUND. HER ARMS WENT INTO THE SUDS

TO HER ELBOWS. SHE LEANED ON THE COUNTER.

AND STARED INTO THE BACKYARD WHERE THEY KEPT

THE RUSTY SWING AND JUNGLE-GYM SET.

IF SHE KEPT WATCHING, SHE WAS SURE TO SEE

THE ELEPHANT STEP OUT OF THE TREES AND TRUMPET

AS IT DID EVERY MONDAY AT THIS HOUSE, AT THIS HOUR.

THE AUTHOR OF HER MISFORTUNE
FOR THE WORLD IS THE WORLD…

AND IT WRITES NO HISTORIES

THAT END IN LOVE.

— STEPHEN SPENDER

I’M NOT THE MAN SHE CLAIMS. BUT

THIS MUCH IS TRUE: THE PAST IS

DISTANT, A RECEDING COASTLINE,

AND WE’RE ALL IN THE SAME BOAT,

A SCRIM OF RAIN OVER THE SEA-LANES.

STILL, I WISH SHE WOULDN’T KEEP ON

SAYING THOSE THINGS ABOUT ME!

OVER THE LONG COURSE

EVERYTHING BUT HOPE LETS YOU GO, THEN

EVEN THAT LOOSENS ITS GRIP.

THERE ISN’T ENOUGH OF ANYTHING

AS LONG AS WE LIVE. BUT AT INTERVALS

A SWEETNESS APPEARS AND, GIVEN A CHANCE,

PREVAILS. IT’S TRUE I’M HAPPY NOW.

AND IT’D BE NICE IF SHE

COULD HOLD HER TONGUE. STOP

HATING ME FOR BEING HAPPY.

BLAMING ME FOR HER LIFE. I’M AFRAID

I’M MIXED UP IN HER MIND

WITH SOMEONE ELSE. A YOUNG MAN

OF NO CHARACTER, LIVING ON DREAMS,

WHO SWORE HE’D LOVE HER FOREVER.

ONE WHO GAVE HER A RING, AND A BRACELET.

WHO SAID, COME WITH ME. YOU CAN TRUST ME.

THINGS TO THAT EFFECT. I’M NOT THAT MAN.

SHE HAS ME CONFUSED, AS I SAID,

WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

POWDER-MONKEY
WHEN MY FRIEND JOHN DUGAN, THE CARPENTER,

LEFT THIS WORLD FOR THE NEXT, HE SEEMED

IN A TERRIBLE HURRY. HE WASN’T, OF COURSE.

ALMOST NO ONE IS. BUT HE BARELY TOOK TIME

TO SAY GOODBYE. “I’LL JUST PUT THESE TOOLS AWAY,”

HE SAID. THEN, “SO LONG.” AND HURRIED

DOWN THE HILL TO HIS PICKUP. HE WAVED, AND

I WAVED. BUT BETWEEN HERE AND DUNGENESS,

WHERE HE USED TO LIVE, HE DRIFTED

OVER THE CENTER LINE, ONTO DEATH’S SIDE.

AND WAS DESTROYED BY A LOGGING TRUCK.

                         HE IS WORKING

UNDER THE SUN WITH HIS SHIRT OFF, A BLUE

BANDANNA AROUND HIS FOREHEAD TO KEEP SWEAT FROM HIS EYES.

DRIVING NAILS. DRILLING AND PLANING LUMBER.

JOINING WOOD TOGETHER WITH OTHER WOOD.

IN EVERY WAY TAKING THE MEASURE OF THIS HOUSE.

STOPPING TO TELL A STORY NOW AND THEN,

ABOUT WHEN HE WAS A YOUNG SQUIRT, WORKING

AS A POWDER-MONKEY. THE CLOSE CALLS HE’D HAD

LAYING FUSES. HIS WHITE TEETH FLASHING WHEN HE LAUGHS.

THE BLOND HANDLEBAR MUSTACHE HE LOVED TO

PULL ON WHILE MUSING. “SO LONG,” HE SAID.

I WANT TO IMAGINE HIM RIDING UNHARMED

TOWARD DEATH. EVEN THOUGH THE FUSE IS BURNING.

NOTHING TO DO THERE IN THE CAB

OF HIS PICKUP BUT LISTEN TO RICKY SKAGGS,

PULL ON HIS MUSTACHE, AND PLAN SATURDAY NIGHT.

THIS MAN WITH ALL DEATH BEFORE HIM.

RIDING UNHARMED, AND UNTOUCHED,

TOWARD DEATH.

EARWIGS
FOR MONA SIMPSON

YOUR DELICIOUS-LOOKING RUM CAKE, COVERED WITH

ALMONDS, WAS HAND-CARRIED TO MY DOOR

THIS MORNING. THE DRIVER PARKED AT THE FOOT

OF THE HILL, AND CLIMBED THE STEEP PATH.

NOTHING ELSE MOVED IN THAT FROZEN LANDSCAPE.

IT WAS COLD INSIDE AND OUT. I SIGNED

FOR IT, THANKED HIM, WENT BACK IN.

WHERE I STRIPPED OFF THE HEAVY TAPE, TORE

THE STAPLES FROM THE BAG, AND INSIDE

FOUND THE CANISTER YOU’D FILLED WITH CAKE.

I SCRATCHED ADHESIVE FROM THE LID.

PRIZED IT OPEN. FOLDED BACK THE ALUMINUM FOIL.

TO CATCH THE FIRST WHIFF OF THAT SWEETNESS!

IT WAS THEN THE EARWIG APPEARED

FROM THE MOIST DEPTHS. AN EARWIG

STUFFED ON YOUR CAKE. DRUNK

FROM IT. HE WENT OVER THE SIDE OF THE CAN.

SCURRIED WILDLY ACROSS THE TABLE TO TAKE

REFUGE IN THE FRUIT BOWL. I DIDN’T KILL IT.

NOT THEN. FILLED AS I WAS WITH CONFLICTING

FEELINGS. DISGUST, OF COURSE. BUT

AMAZEMENT. EVEN ADMIRATION. THIS CREATURE

THAT’D JUST MADE A 3,000-MILE, OVERNIGHT TRIP

BY AIR, SURROUNDED BY CAKE, SHAVED ALMONDS,

AND THE OVERPOWERING ODOR OF RUM. CARRIED

THEN IN A TRUCK OVER A MOUNTAIN ROAD AND

PACKED UPHILL IN FREEZING WEATHER TO A HOUSE

OVERLOOKING THE PACIFIC OCEAN. AN EARWIG.

I’LL LET HIM LIVE, I THOUGHT. WHAT’S ONE MORE,

OR LESS, IN THE WORLD? THIS ONE’S SPECIAL,

MAYBE. BLESSINGS ON ITS STRANGE HEAD.

I LIFTED THE CAKE FROM ITS FOIL WRAPPING

AND THREE MORE EARWIGS WENT OVER THE SIDE

OF THE CAN! FOR A MINUTE I WAS SO TAKEN

ABACK I DIDN’T KNOW IF I SHOULD KILL THEM,

OR WHAT. THEN RAGE SEIZED ME, AND

I PLASTERED THEM. CRUSHED THE LIFE FROM THEM

BEFORE ANY COULD GET AWAY. IT WAS A MASSACRE.

WHILE I WAS AT IT, I FOUND AND DESTROYED

THE OTHER ONE UTTERLY.

I WAS JUST BEGINNING WHEN IT WAS ALL OVER.

I’M SAYING I COULD HAVE GONE ON AND ON,

RENDING THEM. IF IT’S TRUE

THAT MAN IS WOLF TO MAN, WHAT CAN MERE EARWIGS

EXPECT WHEN BLOODLUST IS UP?

I SAT DOWN, TRYING TO QUIETEN MY HEART.

BREATH RUSHING FROM MY NOSE. I LOOKED

AROUND THE TABLE, SLOWLY. READY

FOR ANYTHING. MONA, I’M SORRY TO SAY THIS,

BUT I COULDN’T EAT ANY OF YOUR CAKE.

I’VE PUT IT AWAY FOR LATER, MAYBE.

ANYWAY, THANKS. YOU’RE SWEET TO REMEMBER

ME OUT HERE ALONE THIS WINTER.

LIVING ALONE.

LIKE AN ANIMAL, I THINK.

NYQUIL
CALL IT IRON DISCIPLINE. BUT FOR MONTHS

I NEVER TOOK MY FIRST DRINK

BEFORE ELEVEN P.M. NOT SO BAD,

CONSIDERING. THIS WAS IN THE BEGINNING

PHASE OF THINGS. I KNEW A MAN

WHOSE DRINK OF CHOICE WAS LISTERINE.

HE WAS COMING DOWN OFF SCOTCH.

HE BOUGHT LISTERINE BY THE CASE,

AND DRANK IT BY THE CASE. THE BACK SEAT

OF HIS CAR WAS PILED HIGH WITH DEAD SOLDIERS.

THOSE EMPTY BOTTLES OF LISTERINE

GLEAMING IN HIS SCALDING BACK SEAT!

THE SIGHT OF IT SENT ME HOME SOUL-SEARCHING.

I DID THAT ONCE OR TWICE. EVERYBODY DOES.

GO WAY DOWN INSIDE AND LOOK AROUND.

I SPENT HOURS THERE, BUT

DIDN’T MEET ANYONE, OR SEE ANYTHING

OF INTEREST. I CAME BACK TO THE HERE AND NOW,

AND PUT ON MY SLIPPERS. FIXED

MYSELF A NICE GLASS OF NYQUIL.

DRAGGED A CHAIR OVER TO THE WINDOW.

WHERE I WATCHED A PALE MOON STRUGGLE TO RISE

OVER CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA.

I WAITED THROUGH HOURS OF DARKNESS WITH NYQUIL.

AND THEN, SWEET JESUS! THE FIRST SLIVER

OF LIGHT.

THE POSSIBLE
I SPENT YEARS, ON AND OFF, IN ACADEME.

TAUGHT AT PLACES I COULDN’T GET NEAR

AS A STUDENT. BUT NEVER WROTE A LINE

ABOUT THAT TIME. NEVER. NOTHING STAYED

WITH ME IN THOSE DAYS. I WAS A STRANGER,

AND AN IMPOSTOR, EVEN TO MYSELF. EXCEPT

AT THAT ONE SCHOOL. THAT DISTINGUISHED

INSTITUTION IN THE MIDWEST. WHERE

MY ONLY FRIEND, AND MY COLLEAGUE,

THE CHAUCERIAN, WAS ARRESTED FOR BEATING HIS WIFE.

AND THREATENING HER LIFE OVER THE PHONE,

A MISDEMEANOR. HE WANTED TO PUT HER EYES OUT.

SET HER ON FIRE FOR CHEATING.

THE GUY SHE WAS SEEING, HE WAS GOING TO HAMMER HIM

INTO THE GROUND LIKE A FENCE POST.

HE LOST HIS MIND FOR A TIME, WHILE SHE MOVED AWAY

TO A NEW LIFE. THEREAFTER, HE TAUGHT

HIS CLASSES WEEPING DRUNK. MORE THAN ONCE

WORE HIS LUNCH ON HIS SHIRT FRONT.

I WAS NO HELP. I WAS FADING FAST MYSELF.

BUT SEEING THE WAY HE WAS LIVING, SO TO SPEAK,

I UNDERSTOOD I HADN’T STRAYED SO FAR FROM HOME

AFTER ALL. MY SCHOLAR-FRIEND. MY OLD PAL.

AT LONG LAST I’M OUT OF ALL THAT.

AND YOU. I PRAY YOUR HANDS ARE STEADY,

AND THAT YOU’RE HAPPY TONIGHT. I HOPE SOME WOMAN

HAS JUST PUT HER HAND UNDER YOUR CLEAN COLLAR

A MINUTE AGO, AND TOLD YOU SHE LOVES YOU.

BELIEVE HER, IF YOU CAN, FOR IT’S POSSIBLE SHE MEANS IT.

IS SOMEONE WHO WILL BE TRUE, AND KIND TO YOU.

ALL YOUR REMAINING DAYS.

SHIFTLESS
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE BETTER THAN US WERE COMFORTABLE.

THEY LIVED IN PAINTED HOUSES WITH FLUSH TOILETS.

DROVE CARS WHOSE YEAR AND MAKE WERE RECOGNIZABLE.

THE ONES WORSE OFF WERE SORRY AND DIDN’T WORK.

THEIR STRANGE CARS SAT ON BLOCKS IN DUSTY YARDS.

THE YEARS GO BY AND EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE

GETS REPLACED. BUT THIS MUCH IS STILL TRUE —

I NEVER LIKED WORK. MY GOAL WAS ALWAYS

TO BE SHIFTLESS. I SAW THE MERIT IN THAT.

I LIKED THE IDEA OF SITTING IN A CHAIR

IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE FOR HOURS, DOING NOTHING

BUT WEARING A HAT AND DRINKING COLA.

WHAT’S WRONG WITH THAT?

DRAWING ON A CIGARETTE FROM TIME TO TIME.

SPITTING. MAKING THINGS OUT OF WOOD WITH A KNIFE.

WHERE’S THE HARM THERE? NOW AND THEN CALLING

THE DOGS TO HUNT RABBITS. TRY IT SOMETIME.

ONCE IN A WHILE HAILING A FAT, BLOND KID LIKE ME

AND SAYING, “DON’T I KNOW YOU?”

NOT, “WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO BE WHEN YOU GROW UP?”

THE YOUNG FIRE EATERS OF MEXICO CITY
THEY FILL THEIR MOUTHS WITH ALCOHOL

AND BLOW IT OVER A LIGHTED CANDLE

AT TRAFFIC SIGNS. ANYPLACE, REALLY,

WHERE CARS LINE UP AND THE DRIVERS

ARE ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED AND LOOKING

FOR DISTRACTION—THERE YOU’LL FIND

THE YOUNG FIRE EATERS. DOING WHAT THEY DO

FOR A FEW PESOS. IF THEY’RE LUCKY.

BUT IN A YEAR THEIR LIPS

ARE SCORCHED AND THEIR THROATS RAW.

THEY HAVE NO VOICE WITHIN A YEAR.

THEY CAN’T TALK OR CRY OUT —

THESE SILENT CHILDREN WHO HUNT

THROUGH THE STREETS WITH A CANDLE

AND A BEER CAN FILLED WITH ALCOHOL.

THEY ARE CALLED MILUSOS. WHICH TRANSLATES

INTO “A THOUSAND USES.”

WHERE THE GROCERIES WENT
WHEN HIS MOTHER CALLED FOR THE SECOND TIME

THAT DAY, SHE SAID:

“I DON’T HAVE ANY STRENGTH LEFT. I WANT

TO LAY DOWN ALL THE TIME.”

“DID YOU TAKE YOUR IRON?” HE WANTED TO KNOW.

HE SINCERELY WANTED TO KNOW. PRAYING DAILY,

HOPELESSLY, THAT IRON MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

“YES, BUT IT JUST MAKES ME HUNGRY. AND I DON’T

HAVE ANYTHING TO EAT.”

HE POINTED OUT TO HER THEY’D SHOPPED

FOR HOURS THAT MORNING. BROUGHT HOME

EIGHTY DOLLARS’ WORTH OF FOOD TO STACK

IN HER CUPBOARDS AND THE FRIDGE.

“THERE’S NOTHING TO EAT IN THIS GODDAMN HOUSE

BUT BALONEY AND CHEESE,” SHE SAID.

HER VOICE SHOOK WITH ANGER. “NOTHING!”

“AND HOW’S YOUR CAT? HOW’S KITTY DOING?”

HIS OWN VOICE SHOOK. HE NEEDED

TO GET OFF THIS SUBJECT OF FOOD; IT NEVER

BROUGHT THEM ANYTHING BUT GRIEF.

“KITTY,” HIS MOTHER SAID. “HERE, KITTY.

KITTY, KITTY. SHE WON’T ANSWER ME, HONEY.

I DON’T KNOW THIS FOR SURE, BUT I THINK

SHE JUMPED INTO THE WASHING MACHINE

WHEN I WAS ABOUT TO DO A LOAD. AND BEFORE I FORGET,

THAT MACHINE’S MAKING

A BANGING NOISE. I THINK THERE’S SOMETHING

THE MATTER WITH IT. KITTY! SHE WON’T

ANSWER ME. HONEY, I’M AFRAID.

I’M AFRAID OF EVERYTHING. HELP ME, PLEASE.

THEN YOU CAN GO BACK TO WHATEVER IT WAS

YOU WERE DOING. WHATEVER

IT WAS THAT WAS SO IMPORTANT

I HAD TO TAKE THE TROUBLE

TO BRING YOU INTO THIS WORLD.”

WHAT I CAN DO
ALL I WANT TODAY IS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THESE BIRDS

OUTSIDE MY WINDOW. THE PHONE IS UNPLUGGED

SO MY LOVED ONES CAN’T REACH OUT AND PUT THE ARM

ON ME. I’VE TOLD THEM THE WELL HAS RUN DRY.

THEY WON’T HEAR OF IT. THEY KEEP TRYING

TO GET THROUGH ANYWAY. JUST NOW I CAN’T BEAR TO KNOW

ABOUT THE CAR THAT BLEW ANOTHER GASKET.

OR THE TRAILER I THOUGHT I’D PAID FOR LONG AGO,

NOW FORECLOSED ON. OR THE SON IN ITALY

WHO THREATENS TO END HIS LIFE THERE

UNLESS I KEEP PAYING THE BILLS. MY MOTHER WANTS

TO TALK TO ME TOO. WANTS TO REMIND ME AGAIN HOW IT WAS

BACK THEN. ALL THE MILK I DRANK, CRADLED IN HER ARMS.

THAT OUGHT TO BE WORTH SOMETHING NOW. SHE NEEDS

ME TO PAY FOR THIS NEW MOVE OF HERS. SHE’D LIKE

TO LOOP BACK TO SACRAMENTO FOR THE TWENTIETH TIME.

EVERYBODY’S LUCK HAS GONE SOUTH. ALL I ASK

IS TO BE ALLOWED TO SIT FOR A MOMENT LONGER.

NURSING A BITE THE SHELTY DOG KEEPER GAVE ME LAST NIGHT.

AND WATCHING THESE BIRDS. WHO DON’T ASK FOR A THING

EXCEPT SUNNY WEATHER. IN A MINUTE

I’LL HAVE TO PLUG IN THE PHONE AND TRY TO SEPARATE

WHAT’S RIGHT FROM WRONG. UNTIL THEN

A DOZEN TINY BIRDS, NO BIGGER THAN TEACUPS,

PERCH IN THE BRANCHES OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

SUDDENLY THEY STOP SINGING AND TURN THEIR HEADS.

IT’S CLEAR THEY’VE FELT SOMETHING.

THEY DIVE INTO FLIGHT.

THE LITTLE ROOM
THERE WAS A GREAT RECKONING.

WORDS FLEW LIKE STONES THROUGH WINDOWS.

SHE YELLED AND YELLED, LIKE THE ANGEL OF JUDGMENT.

THEN THE SUN SHOT UP, AND A CONTRAIL

APPEARED IN THE MORNING SKY.

IN THE SUDDEN SILENCE, THE LITTLE ROOM

BECAME ODDLY LONELY AS HE DRIED HER TEARS.

BECAME LIKE ALL THE OTHER LITTLE ROOMS ON EARTH

LIGHT FINDS HARD TO PENETRATE.

ROOMS WHERE PEOPLE YELL AND HURT EACH OTHER.

AND AFTERWARDS FEEL PAIN, AND LONELINESS.

UNCERTAINTY. THE NEED TO COMFORT.

SWEET LIGHT
AFTER THE WINTER, GRIEVING AND DULL,

I FLOURISHED HERE ALL SPRING. SWEET LIGHT

BEGAN TO FILL MY CHEST. I PULLED UP

A CHAIR. SAT FOR HOURS IN FRONT OF THE SEA.

LISTENED TO THE BUOY AND LEARNED

TO TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BELL,

AND THE SOUND OF A BELL. I WANTED

EVERYTHING BEHIND ME. I EVEN WANTED

TO BECOME INHUMAN. AND I DID THAT.

I KNOW I DID. (SHE’LL BACK ME UP ON THIS.)

I REMEMBER THE MORNING I CLOSED THE LID

ON MEMORY AND TURNED THE HANDLE.

LOCKING IT AWAY FOREVER.

NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME

OUT HERE, SEA. ONLY YOU AND I KNOW.

AT NIGHT, CLOUDS FORM IN FRONT OF THE MOON.

BY MORNING THEY’RE GONE. AND THAT SWEET LIGHT

I SPOKE OF? THAT’S GONE TOO.

THE GARDEN
IN THE GARDEN, SMALL LAUGHTER FROM YEARS AGO.

LANTERNS BURNING IN THE WILLOWS.

THE POWER OF THOSE FOUR WORDS, “I LOVED A WOMAN.”

PUT THAT ON THE STONE BESIDE HIS NAME.

GOD KEEP YOU AND BE WITH YOU.

THOSE HORSES COMING INTO THE STRETCH AT RUIDOSO!

MIST RISING FROM THE MEADOW AT DAWN.

FROM THE VERANDA, THE BLUE OUTLINES OF THE MOUNTAINS.

WHAT USED TO BE WITHIN REACH, OUT OF REACH.

AND IN SOME LESSER THINGS, JUST THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

ORDER ANYTHING YOU WANT! THEN LOOK FOR THE MAN

WITH THE LIMP TO GO BY. HE’LL PAY.

FROM A BREAK IN THE WALL, I COULD LOOK DOWN

ON THE SHANTY LIGHTS IN THE VALLEY OF KIDRON.

VERY LITTLE SLEEP UNDER STRANGE ROOFS. HIS LIFE FAR AWAY.

PLAYING CHECKERS WITH MY DAD. THEN HE HUNTS UP

THE SHAVING SOAP, THE BRUSH AND BOWL, THE STRAIGHT

RAZOR, AND WE DRIVE TO THE COUNTY HOSPITAL. I WATCH HIM

LATHER MY GRANDPA’S FACE. THEN SHAVE HIM.

THE DYING BODY IS A CLUMSY PARTNER.

DROPS OF WATER IN YOUR HAIR.

THE DARK YELLOW OF THE FIELDS, THE BLACK AND BLUE RIVERS.

GOING OUT FOR A WALK MEANS YOU INTEND TO RETURN, RIGHT?

EVENTUALLY.

THE FLAME IS GUTTERING. MARVELOUS.

THE MEETING BETWEEN GOETHE AND BEETHOVEN

TOOK PLACE IN LEIPZIG IN 1812. THEY TALKED INTO THE NIGHT

ABOUT LORD BYRON AND NAPOLEON.

SHE GOT OFF THE ROAD AND FROM THEN ON IT WAS NOTHING

BUT HARDPAN ALL THE WAY.

SHE TOOK A STICK AND IN THE DUST DREW THE HOUSE WHERE

THEY’D LIVE AND RAISE THEIR CHILDREN.

THERE WAS A DUCK POND AND A PLACE FOR HORSES.

TO WRITE ABOUT IT, ONE WOULD HAVE TO WRITE IN A WAY

THAT WOULD STOP THE HEART AND MAKE ONE’S HAIR STAND ON END.

CERVANTES LOST A HAND IN THE BATTLE OF LEPANTO.

THIS WAS IN 1571, THE LAST GREAT SEA BATTLE FOUGHT

IN SHIPS MANNED BY GALLEY SLAVES.

IN THE UNUK RIVER, IN KETCHIKAN, THE BACKS OF THE SALMON

UNDER THE STREET LIGHTS AS THEY COME THROUGH TOWN.

STUDENTS AND YOUNG PEOPLE CHANTED A REQUIEM

AS TOLSTOY’S COFFIN WAS CARRIED ACROSS THE YARD

OF THE STATIONMASTER’S HOUSE AT ASTAPOVO AND PLACED

IN THE FREIGHT CAR. TO THE ACCOMPANIMENT OF SINGING,

THE TRAIN SLOWLY MOVED OFF.

A HARD SAIL AND THE SAME STARS EVERYWHERE.

BUT THE GARDEN IS RIGHT OUTSIDE MY WINDOW.

DON’T WORRY YOUR HEART ABOUT ME, MY DARLING.

WE WEAVE THE THREAD GIVEN TO US.

AND SPRING IS WITH ME.

SON
AWAKENED THIS MORNING BY A VOICE FROM MY CHILDHOOD

THAT SAYS TIME TO GET UP, I GET UP.

ALL NIGHT LONG, IN MY SLEEP, TRYING

TO FIND A PLACE WHERE MY MOTHER COULD LIVE

AND BE HAPPY. IF YOU WANT ME TO LOSE MY MIND,

THE VOICE SAYS OKAY. OTHERWISE,

GET ME OUT OF HERE! I’M THE ONE TO BLAME

FOR MOVING HER TO THIS TOWN SHE HATES. RENTING

HER THE HOUSE SHE HATES.

PUTTING THOSE NEIGHBORS SHE HATES SO CLOSE.

BUYING THE FURNITURE SHE HATES.

WHY DIDN’T YOU GIVE ME MONEY INSTEAD, AND LET ME SPEND IT?

I WANT TO GO BACK TO CALIFORNIA, THE VOICE SAYS.

I’LL DIE IF I STAY HERE. DO YOU WANT ME TO DIE?

THERE’S NO ANSWER TO THIS, OR TO ANYTHING ELSE

IN THE WORLD THIS MORNING. THE PHONE RINGS

AND RINGS. I CAN’T GO NEAR IT FOR FEAR

OF HEARING MY NAME ONCE MORE. THE SAME NAME

MY FATHER ANSWERED TO FOR 53 YEARS.

BEFORE GOING TO HIS REWARD.

HE DIED JUST AFTER SAYING “TAKE THIS

INTO THE KITCHEN, SON.”

THE WORD SON ISSUING FROM HIS LIPS.

WOBBLING IN THE AIR FOR ALL TO HEAR.

KAFKA’S WATCH
FROM A LETTER

I HAVE A JOB WITH A TINY SALARY OF 80 CROWNS, AND

AN INFINITE EIGHT TO NINE HOURS OF WORK.

I DEVOUR THE TIME OUTSIDE THE OFFICE LIKE A WILD BEAST.

SOMEDAY I HOPE TO SIT IN A CHAIR IN ANOTHER

COUNTRY, LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT FIELDS OF SUGARCANE

OR MOHAMMEDAN CEMETERIES.

I DON’T COMPLAIN ABOUT THE WORK SO MUCH AS ABOUT

THE SLUGGISHNESS OF SWAMPY TIME. THE OFFICE HOURS

CANNOT BE DIVIDED UP! I FEEL THE PRESSURE

OF THE FULL EIGHT OR NINE HOURS EVEN IN THE LAST

HALF HOUR OF THE DAY. IT’S LIKE A TRAIN RIDE

LASTING NIGHT AND DAY. IN THE END YOU’RE TOTALLY

CRUSHED. YOU NO LONGER THINK ABOUT THE STRAINING

OF THE ENGINE, OR ABOUT THE HILLS OR

FLAT COUNTRYSIDE, BUT ASCRIBE ALL THAT’S HAPPENING

TO YOUR WATCH ALONE. THE WATCH WHICH YOU CONTINUALLY HOLD

IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. THEN SHAKE. AND BRING SLOWLY

TO YOUR EAR IN DISBELIEF.

THE LIGHTNING SPEED OF THE PAST
THE CORPSE FOSTERS ANXIETY IN MEN WHO BELIEVE

IN THE LAST JUDGMENT, AND THOSE WHO DON’T.

— ANDRÉ MALRAUX

HE BURIED HIS WIFE, WHO’D DIED IN

MISERY. IN MISERY, HE

TOOK TO HIS PORCH, WHERE HE WATCHED

THE SUN SET AND THE MOON RISE.

THE DAYS SEEMED TO PASS, ONLY TO RETURN

AGAIN. LIKE A DREAM IN WHICH ONE THINKS,

I’VE ALREADY DREAMT THAT.

NOTHING, HAVING ARRIVED, WILL STAY.

WITH HIS KNIFE HE CUT THE SKIN

FROM AN APPLE. THE WHITE PULP, BODY

OF THE APPLE, DARKENED

AND TURNED BROWN, THEN BLACK,

BEFORE HIS EYES. THE WORN-OUT FACE OF DEATH!

THE LIGHTNING SPEED OF THE PAST.

VIGIL
THEY WAITED ALL DAY FOR THE SUN TO APPEAR. THEN,

LATE IN THE AFTERNOON, LIKE A GOOD PRINCE,

IT SHOWED ITSELF FOR A FEW MINUTES.

BLAZING HIGH OVER THE BENCHLAND THAT LIES AT THE FOOT

OF THE PEAKS BEHIND THEIR BORROWED HOUSE.

THEN THE CLOUDS WERE DRAWN ONCE MORE.

THEY WERE HAPPY ENOUGH. BUT ALL EVENING

THE CURTAINS MADE MELANCHOLY GESTURES,

SWISHING IN FRONT OF THE OPEN WINDOWS. AFTER DINNER

THEY STEPPED ONTO THE BALCONY.

WHERE THEY HEARD THE RIVER PLUNGING IN THE CANYON AND,

CLOSER, THE CREAK OF TREES, SIGH OF BOUGHS.

THE TALL GRASSES PROMISED TO RUSTLE FOREVER.

SHE PUT HER HAND ON HIS NECK. HE TOUCHED HER CHEEK.

THEN BATS CAME FROM ALL SIDES TO HARRY THEM BACK.

INSIDE, THEY CLOSED THE WINDOWS. KEPT THEIR DISTANCE.

WATCHED A PROCESSION OF STARS. AND, ONCE IN A WHILE,

CREATURES THAT FLUNG THEMSELVES IN FRONT OF THE MOON.

IN THE LOBBY OF THE HOTEL DEL MAYO
THE GIRL IN THE LOBBY READING A LEATHER-BOUND BOOK.

THE MAN IN THE LOBBY USING A BROOM.

THE BOY IN THE LOBBY WATERING PLANTS.

THE DESK CLERK LOOKING AT HIS NAILS.

THE WOMAN IN THE LOBBY WRITING A LETTER.

THE OLD MAN IN THE LOBBY SLEEPING IN HIS CHAIR.

THE FAN IN THE LOBBY REVOLVING SLOWLY OVERHEAD.

ANOTHER HOT SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

SUDDENLY, THE GIRL LAYS HER FINGER BETWEEN THE PAGES OF

    HER BOOK.

THE MAN LEANS ON HIS BROOM AND LOOKS.

THE BOY STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

THE DESK CLERK RAISES HIS EYES AND STARES.

THE WOMAN QUITS WRITING.

THE OLD MAN STIRS AND WAKES UP.

WHAT IS IT?

SOMEONE IS RUNNING UP FROM THE HARBOR.

SOMEONE WHO HAS THE SUN BEHIND HIM.

SOMEONE WHO IS BARECHESTED.

WAVING HIS ARMS.

IT’S CLEAR SOMETHING TERRIBLE HAS HAPPENED.

THE MAN IS RUNNING STRAIGHT FOR THE HOTEL.

HIS LIPS ARE WORKING THEMSELVES INTO A SCREAM.

EVERYONE IN THE LOBBY WILL RECALL THEIR TERROR.

EVERYONE WILL REMEMBER THIS MOMENT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES.

BAHIA, BRAZIL
THE WIND IS LEVEL NOW. BUT PAILS OF RAIN

FELL TODAY, AND THE DAY BEFORE,

AND THE DAY BEFORE THAT, ALL THE WAY BACK

TO CREATION. THE BUILDINGS

IN THE OLD SLAVE QUARTER ARE DISSOLVING,

AND NOBODY CARES. NOT THE GHOSTS

OF THE OLD SLAVES, OR THE YOUNG.

THE WATER FEELS GOOD ON THEIR WHIPPED BACKS.

THEY COULD CRY WITH RELIEF.

NO SUNSETS IN THIS PLACE. LIGHT ONE MINUTE,

AND THEN THE STARS COME OUT.

WE COULD LOOK ALL NIGHT IN VAIN

FOR THE BIG DIPPER. DOWN HERE

THE SOUTHERN CROSS IS OUR SIGN.

I’M SICK OF THE SOUND OF MY OWN VOICE!

UNEASY, AND DREAMING

OF RUM THAT COULD SPLIT MY SKULL OPEN.

THERE’S A BODY LYING ON THE STAIRS.

STEP OVER IT. THE LIGHTS IN THE TOWER

HAVE GONE OUT. A SPIDER HOPS FROM THE MAN’S

HAIR. THIS LIFE. I’M SAYING IT’S ONE

AMAZING THING AFTER THE OTHER.

LINES OF MEN IN THE STREET,

AS OPPOSED TO LINES OF POETRY.

CHOOSE! ARE YOU GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?

WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU? HE ANSWERED.

WELL, SAY THE HOUSE WAS BURNING.

WOULD YOU SAVE THE CAT OR THE REMBRANDT?

THAT’S EASY. I DON’T HAVE A REMBRANDT,

AND I DON’T HAVE A CAT. BUT I HAVE

A SORREL HORSE BACK HOME

THAT I WANT TO RIDE ONCE MORE

INTO THE HIGH COUNTRY.

SOON ENOUGH WE’LL ROT UNDER THE EARTH.

NO TRUTH TO THIS, JUST A FACT.

WE WHO GAVE EACH OTHER SO MUCH

HAPPINESS WHILE ALIVE —

WE’RE GOING TO ROT. BUT WE WON’T

ROT IN THIS PLACE. NOT HERE.

ARMS SHACKLED TOGETHER.

JESUS, THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A THING!

THIS LIFE. THESE SHACKLES.

I SHOULDN’T BRING IT UP.

THE PHENOMENON
I WOKE UP FEELING WIPED OUT. GOD KNOWS

WHERE I’VE BEEN ALL NIGHT, BUT MY FEET HURT.

OUTSIDE MY WINDOW, A PHENOMENON IS TAKING PLACE.

THE SUN AND MOON HANG SIDE-BY-SIDE OVER THE WATER.

TWO SIDES OF THE SAME COIN. I CLIMB FROM BED

SLOWLY, MUCH AS AN OLD MAN MIGHT MANEUVER

FROM HIS MUSTY BED IN MIDWINTER, FINDING IT DIFFICULT

FOR A MOMENT EVEN TO MAKE WATER! I TELL MYSELF

THIS HAS TO BE A TEMPORARY CONDITION.

IN A FEW YEARS, NO PROBLEM. BUT WHEN I LOOK OUT

THE WINDOW AGAIN, THERE’S A SUDDEN SWOOP OF FEELING.

ONCE MORE I’M ARRESTED WITH THE BEAUTY OF THIS PLACE.

I WAS LYING IF I EVER SAID ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY.

I MOVE CLOSER TO THE GLASS AND SEE IT’S HAPPENED

BETWEEN THIS THOUGHT AND THAT. THE MOON

IS GONE. SET, AT LAST.

WIND
FOR RICHARD FORD

WATER PERFECTLY CALM. PERFECTLY AMAZING.

FLOCKS OF BIRDS MOVING

RESTLESSLY. MYSTERY ENOUGH IN THAT, GOD KNOWS.

YOU ASK IF I HAVE THE TIME. I DO.

TIME TO GO IN. FISH NOT BITING

ANYWAY. NOTHING DOING ANYWHERE.

WHEN, A MILE AWAY, WE SEE WIND

MOVING ACROSS THE WATER. SIT QUIET AND

WATCH IT COME. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

JUST WIND. NOT SO STRONG. THOUGH STRONG ENOUGH.

YOU SAY, “LOOK AT THAT!”

AND WE HOLD ON TO THE GUNWALES AS IT PASSES.

I FEEL IT FAN MY FACE AND EARS. FEEL IT

RUFFLE MY HAIR—SWEETER, IT SEEMS,

THAN ANY WOMAN’S FINGERS.

THEN TURN MY HEAD AND WATCH

IT MOVE ON DOWN THE STRAIT,

DRIVING WAVES BEFORE IT.

LEAVING WAVES TO FLOP AGAINST

OUR HULL. THE BIRDS GOING CRAZY NOW.

BOAT ROCKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE.

“JESUS,” YOU SAY, “I NEVER SAW ANYTHING LIKE IT.”

“RICHARD,” I SAY —

“YOU’LL NEVER SEE THAT IN MANHATTAN, MY FRIEND.”

MIGRATION
A LATE SUMMER’S DAY, AND MY FRIEND ON THE COURT

WITH HIS FRIEND. BETWEEN GAMES, THE OTHER REMARKS

HOW MY FRIEND’S STEP SEEMS NOT TO HAVE ANY SPRING

TO IT. HIS SERVE ISN’T SO HOT, EITHER.

“YOU FEELING OKAY?” HE ASKS. “YOU HAD A CHECKUP

LATELY?” SUMMER, AND THE LIVING IS EASY.

BUT MY FRIEND WENT TO SEE A DOCTOR FRIEND OF HIS.

WHO TOOK HIS ARM AND GAVE HIM THREE MONTHS, NO LONGER.

WHEN I SAW HIM A DAY LATER, IT

WAS IN THE AFTERNOON. HE WAS WATCHING TV.

HE LOOKED THE SAME, BUT—HOW SHOULD I SAY IT? —

DIFFERENT. HE WAS EMBARRASSED ABOUT THE TV

AND TURNED THE SOUND DOWN A LITTLE. BUT HE COULDN’T

SIT STILL. HE CIRCLED THE ROOM, AGAIN AND AGAIN.

“IT’S A PROGRAM ON ANIMAL MIGRATION,” HE SAID, AS IF THIS

MIGHT EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

I PUT MY ARMS AROUND HIM AND GAVE HIM A HUG.

NOT THE REALLY BIG HUG I WAS CAPABLE OF. BEING AFRAID

THAT ONE OF US, OR BOTH, MIGHT GO TO PIECES.

AND THERE WAS THE MOMENTARY, CRAZY AND DISHONORABLE

THOUGHT —

THIS MIGHT BE CATCHING.

I ASKED FOR AN ASHTRAY, AND HE WAS HAPPY

TO RANGE AROUND THE HOUSE UNTIL HE FOUND ONE.

WE DIDN’T TALK. NOT THEN. TOGETHER WE FINISHED WATCHING

THE SHOW. REINDEER, POLAR BEARS, FISH, WATERFOWL,

BUTTERFLIES AND MORE. SOMETIMES THEY WENT FROM ONE

CONTINENT, OR OCEAN, TO ANOTHER. BUT IT WAS HARD

TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE STORY TAKING PLACE ON SCREEN.

MY FRIEND STOOD, AS I RECALL, THE WHOLE TIME.

WAS HE FEELING OKAY? HE FELT FINE. HE JUST COULDN’T

SEEM TO STAY STILL, WAS ALL. SOMETHING CAME INTO HIS EYES

AND WENT AWAY AGAIN. “WHAT IN HELL ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?”

HE WANTED TO KNOW. BUT DIDN’T WAIT FOR AN ANSWER.

BEGAN TO WALK SOME MORE. I FOLLOWED HIM AWKWARDLY

FROM ROOM TO ROOM WHILE HE REMARKED ON THE WEATHER,

HIS JOB, HIS EX-WIFE, HIS KIDS. SOON, HE GUESSED,

HE’D HAVE TO TELL THEM … SOMETHING.

“AM I REALLY GOING TO DIE?”

WHAT I REMEMBER MOST ABOUT THAT AWFUL DAY

WAS HIS RESTLESSNESS, AND MY CAUTIOUS HUGS—HELLO, GOODBYE.

HE KEPT MOVING UNTIL

WE REACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND STOPPED.

HE PEERED OUT, AND DREW BACK AS IF ASTOUNDED

IT COULD BE LIGHT OUTSIDE. A BANK OF SHADOW

FROM HIS HEDGE BLOCKED THE DRIVE. AND SHADOW FELL

FROM THE GARAGE ONTO HIS LAWN. HE WALKED ME TO THE CAR.

OUR SHOULDERS BUMPED. WE SHOOK HANDS, AND I HUGGED HIM

ONCE MORE. LIGHTLY. THEN HE TURNED AND WENT BACK,

PASSING QUICKLY INSIDE, CLOSING THE DOOR. HIS FACE

APPEARED BEHIND THE WINDOW, THEN WAS GONE.

HE’LL BE ON THE MOVE FROM NOW ON. TRAVELING NIGHT AND DAY,

WITHOUT CEASE, ALL OF HIM, EVERY LAST EXPLODING PIECE

OF HIM. UNTIL HE REACHES A PLACE ONLY HE KNOWS ABOUT.

AN ARCTIC PLACE, COLD AND FROZEN. WHERE HE THINKS,

THIS IS FAR ENOUGH. THIS IS THE PLACE.

AND LIES DOWN, FOR HE IS TIRED.

SLEEPING
HE SLEPT ON HIS HANDS.

ON A ROCK.

ON HIS FEET.

ON SOMEONE ELSE’S FEET.

HE SLEPT ON BUSES, TRAINS, IN AIRPLANES.

SLEPT ON DUTY.

SLEPT BESIDE THE ROAD.

SLEPT ON A SACK OF APPLES.

HE SLEPT IN A PAY TOILET.

IN A HAYLOFT.

IN THE SUPER DOME.

SLEPT IN A JAGUAR, AND IN THE BACK OF A PICKUP.

SLEPT IN THEATERS.

IN JAIL.

ON BOATS.

HE SLEPT IN LINE SHACKS AND, ONCE, IN A CASTLE.

SLEPT IN THE RAIN.

IN BLISTERING SUN HE SLEPT.

ON HORSEBACK.

HE SLEPT IN CHAIRS, CHURCHES, IN FANCY HOTELS.

HE SLEPT UNDER STRANGE ROOFS ALL HIS LIFE.

NOW HE SLEEPS UNDER THE EARTH.

SLEEPS ON AND ON.

LIKE AN OLD KING.

THE RIVER
I WADED, DEEPENING, INTO THE DARK WATER.

EVENING, AND THE PUSH

AND SWIRL OF THE RIVER AS IT CLOSED

AROUND MY LEGS AND HELD ON.

YOUNG GRILSE BROKE WATER.

PARR DARTED ONE WAY, SMOLT ANOTHER.

GRAVEL TURNED UNDER MY BOOTS AS I EDGED OUT.

WATCHED BY THE FURIOUS EYES OF KING SALMON.

THEIR IMMENSE HEADS TURNED SLOWLY,

EYES BURNING WITH FURY, AS THEY HUNG

IN THE DEEP CURRENT.

THEY WERE THERE. I FELT THEM THERE,

AND MY SKIN PRICKLED. BUT

THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

I BRACED WITH THE WIND ON MY NECK.

FELT THE HAIR RISE

AS SOMETHING TOUCHED MY BOOT.

GREW AFRAID AT WHAT I COULDN’T SEE.

THEN OF EVERYTHING THAT FILLED MY EYES —

THAT OTHER SHORE HEAVY WITH BRANCHES,

THE DARK LIP OF THE MOUNTAIN RANGE BEHIND.

AND THIS RIVER THAT HAD SUDDENLY

GROWN BLACK AND SWIFT.

I DREW BREATH AND CAST ANYWAY.

PRAYED NOTHING WOULD STRIKE.

THE BEST TIME OF THE DAY
COOL SUMMER NIGHTS.

WINDOWS OPEN.

LAMPS BURNING.

FRUIT IN THE BOWL.

AND YOUR HEAD ON MY SHOULDER.

THESE THE HAPPIEST MOMENTS IN THE DAY.

NEXT TO THE EARLY MORNING HOURS,

OF COURSE. AND THE TIME

JUST BEFORE LUNCH.

AND THE AFTERNOON, AND

EARLY EVENING HOURS.

BUT I DO LOVE

THESE SUMMER NIGHTS.

EVEN MORE, I THINK,

THAN THOSE OTHER TIMES.

THE WORK FINISHED FOR THE DAY.

AND NO ONE WHO CAN REACH US NOW.

OR EVER.

SCALE
FOR RICHARD MARIUS

IT’S AFTERNOON WHEN HE TAKES OFF

HIS CLOTHES AND LIES DOWN.

LIGHTS HIS CIGARETTE. ASHTRAY

BALANCED OVER HIS HEART.

THE CHEST RISING, THEN

SINKING

AS HE DRAWS, HOLDS IT,

AND LETS THE SMOKE OUT IN SPURTS.

THE SHADES ARE DRAWN. HIS EYELIDS

CLOSING. IT’S LIKE AFTER SEX,

A LITTLE. BUT ONLY A LITTLE.

WAVES THRASH BELOW THE HOUSE.

HE FINISHES THE CIGARETTE.

ALL THE WHILE THINKING

OF THOMAS MORE WHO,

ACCORDING TO ERASMUS, “LIKED EGGS”

AND NEVER LAY WITH HIS SECOND WIFE.

THE HEAD STARES DOWN AT ITS TRUNK

UNTIL IT THINKS IT HAS IT

MEMORIZED AND COULD RECOGNIZE

IT ANYWHERE, EVEN IN DEATH.

BUT NOW THE DESIRE TO SLEEP

HAS LEFT HIM, UTTERLY.

HE IS STILL REMEMBERING MORE

AND HIS HAIR SHIRT. AFTER THIRTY YEARS OF WEAR

HE HANDED IT OVER, ALONG WITH HIS CLOAK,

BEFORE EMBRACING HIS EXECUTIONER.

HE GETS UP TO RAISE THE SHADES.

LIGHT SLICES THE ROOM IN TWO.

A BOAT SLOWLY ROUNDS THE HOOK

WITH ITS SAILS LOWERED.

THERE’S A MILKY HAZE

OVER THE WATER. A SILENCE THERE.

IT’S MUCH TOO QUIET.

EVEN THE BIRDS ARE STILL.

SOMEWHERE, OFF IN ANOTHER ROOM,

SOMETHING HAS BEEN DECIDED.

A DECISION REACHED, PAPERS SIGNED

AND PUSHED ASIDE.

HE KEEPS ON STARING AT THE BOAT.

THE EMPTY RIGGING, THE DESERTED DECK.

THE BOAT RISES. MOVES CLOSER.

HE PEERS THROUGH THE GLASSES.

THE HUMAN FIGURE, THE MUSIC

IT MAKES, THAT’S WHAT’S MISSING

FROM THE TINY DECK.

A DECK NO BROADER THAN A LEAF.

SO HOW COULD IT SUPPORT A LIFE?

SUDDENLY, THE BOAT SHUDDERS.

STOPS DEAD IN THE WATER.

HE SWEEPS THE GLASSES OVER THE DECK.

BUT AFTER A WHILE HIS ARMS GROW

UNBEARABLY HEAVY. SO HE DROPS THEM,

JUST AS HE WOULD ANYTHING UNBEARABLE.

HE LAYS THE GLASSES ON THE SHELF.

BEGINS DRESSING. BUT THE IMAGE

OF THE BOAT STAYS. DRIFTING.

STAYS AWHILE LONGER. THEN BOBS AWAY.

FORGOTTEN ABOUT AS HE TAKES UP

HIS COAT. OPENS THE DOOR. GOES OUT.

COMPANY
THIS MORNING I WOKE UP TO RAIN

ON THE GLASS. AND UNDERSTOOD

THAT FOR A LONG TIME NOW

I’VE CHOSEN THE CORRUPT WHEN

I HAD A CHOICE. OR ELSE,

SIMPLY, THE MERELY EASY.

OVER THE VIRTUOUS. OR THE DIFFICULT.

THIS WAY OF THINKING HAPPENS

WHEN I’VE BEEN ALONE FOR DAYS.

LIKE NOW. HOURS SPENT

IN MY OWN DUMB COMPANY.

HOURS AND HOURS

MUCH LIKE A LITTLE ROOM.

WITH JUST A STRIP OF CARPET TO WALK ON.

YESTERDAY
YESTERDAY I DRESSED IN A DEAD MAN’S

WOOLEN UNDERWEAR. THEN DROVE TO THE END

OF AN ICY ROAD WHERE I PASSED

SOME TIME WITH INDIAN FISHERMEN.

I STEPPED INTO WATER OVER MY BOOTS.

SAW FOUR PINTAILS SPRING FROM THE CREEK.

NEVER MIND THAT MY THOUGHTS WERE ELSEWHERE

AND I MISSED THE PERFECT SHOT.

OR THAT MY SOCKS FROZE. I LOST TRACK

OF EVERYTHING AND DIDN’T MAKE IT BACK

FOR LUNCH. YOU COULD SAY

IT WASN’T MY DAY. BUT IT WAS!

AND TO PROVE IT I HAVE THIS LITTLE BITE

SHE GAVE ME LAST NIGHT. A BRUISE

COLORING MY LIP TODAY, TO REMIND ME.

THE SCHOOLDESK
THE FISHING IN LOUGH ARROW IS PISS-POOR.

TOO MUCH RAIN, TOO MUCH HIGH WATER.

THEY SAY THE MAYFLY HATCH HAS COME

AND GONE. ALL DAY I STAY PUT

BY THE WINDOW OF THE BORROWED COTTAGE

IN BALLINDOON, WAITING FOR A BREAK

IN THE WEATHER. A TURF FIRE SMOKES

IN THE GRATE, THOUGH NO ROMANCE

IN THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE

HERE. JUST OUTSIDE THE WINDOW AN OLD IRON

AND WOOD SCHOOLDESK KEEPS ME COMPANY.

SOMETHING IS CARVED INTO THE DESK UNDER

THE INKWELL. IT DOESN’T MATTER

WHAT; I’M NOT CURIOUS. IT’S ENOUGH

TO IMAGINE THE INSTRUMENT

THAT GOUGED THOSE LETTERS.

               MY DAD IS DEAD,

AND MOTHER SLIPS IN AND OUT OF HER MIND.

I CAN’T BEGIN TO SAY HOW BAD IT IS

FOR MY GROWN-UP SON AND DAUGHTER.

THEY TOOK ONE LONG LOOK AT ME

AND TRIED TO MAKE ALL MY MISTAKES.

MORE’S THE PITY. BAD LUCK FOR THEM,

MY SWEET CHILDREN. AND HAVEN’T I MENTIONED

MY FIRST WIFE YET? WHAT’S WRONG WITH ME

THAT I HAVEN’T? WELL, I CAN’T ANYMORE.

SHOULDN’T, ANYWAY. SHE CLAIMS

I SAY TOO MUCH AS IT IS.

SAYS SHE’S HAPPY NOW, AND GRINDS HER TEETH.

SAYS THE LORD JESUS LOVES HER,

AND SHE’LL GET BY. THAT LOVE

OF MY LIFE OVER AND DONE WITH. BUT WHAT

DOES THAT SAY ABOUT MY LIFE?

MY LOVED ONES ARE THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY.

BUT THEY’RE IN THIS COTTAGE TOO,

IN BALLINDOON. AND IN EVERY

HOTEL ROOM I WAKE UP IN THESE DAYS.

THE RAIN HAS LET UP.

AND THE SUN HAS APPEARED AND SMALL

CLOUDS OF UNEXPECTED MAYFLIES,

PROVING SOMEONE WRONG. WE MOVE

TO THE DOOR IN A GROUP, MY FAMILY AND I.

AND GO OUTSIDE. WHERE I BEND OVER THE DESK

AND RUN MY FINGERS ACROSS ITS ROUGH SURFACE.

SOMEONE LAUGHS, SOMEONE GRINDS HER TEETH.

AND SOMEONE, SOMEONE IS PLEADING WITH ME.

SAYING, “FOR CHRIST’S SAKE, DON’T

TURN YOUR BACK ON ME.”

AN ASS AND CART PASS DOWN THE LANE.

THE DRIVER TAKES THE PIPE FROM HIS MOUTH

AND RAISES HIS HAND.

THERE’S THE SMELL OF LILACS IN THE DAMP AIR.

MAYFLIES HOVER OVER THE LILACS,

AND OVER THE HEADS OF MY LOVED ONES.

HUNDREDS OF MAYFLIES.

I SIT ON THE BENCH. LEAN

OVER THE DESK. I CAN REMEMBER

MYSELF WITH A PEN. IN THE BEGINNING,

LOOKING AT PICTURES OF WORDS.

LEARNING TO WRITE THEM, SLOWLY,

ONE LETTER AT A TIME. PRESSING DOWN.

A WORD. THEN THE NEXT.

THE FEELING OF MASTERING SOMETHING.

THE EXCITEMENT OF IT.

PRESSING HARD. AT FIRST

THE DAMAGE CONFINED TO THE SURFACE.

BUT THEN DEEPER.

THESE BLOSSOMS. LILACS.

HOW THEY FILL THE AIR WITH SWEETNESS!

MAYFLIES IN THE AIR AS THE CART

GOES BY—AS THE FISH RISE.

CUTLERY
TROLLING THE COHO FLY TWENTY FEET BEHIND THE BOAT,

UNDER MOONLIGHT, WHEN THE HUGE SALMON HIT IT!

AND LUNGED CLEAR OF THE WATER. STOOD, IT SEEMED,

ON ITS TAIL. THEN FELL BACK AND WAS GONE.

SHAKEN, I STEERED ON INTO THE HARBOR AS IF

NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. BUT IT HAD.

AND IT HAPPENED IN JUST THE WAY I’VE SAID.

I TOOK THE MEMORY WITH ME TO NEW YORK,

AND BEYOND. TOOK IT WHEREVER I WENT.

ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE ONTO THE TERRACE

OF THE JOCKEY CLUB IN ROSARIO, ARGENTINA.

WHERE I LOOK OUT ONTO THE BROAD RIVER

THAT THROWS BACK LIGHT FROM THE OPEN WINDOWS

OF THE DINING ROOM. I STAND SMOKING A CIGAR,

LISTENING TO THE MURMURING OF THE OFFICERS

AND THEIR WIVES INSIDE; THE LITTLE CLASHING

SOUND OF CUTLERY AGAINST PLATES. I’M ALIVE

AND WELL, NEITHER HAPPY NOR UNHAPPY,

HERE IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE. SO I’M ALL THE MORE

ASTONISHED WHEN I RECALL THAT LOST FISH RISING,

LEAVING THE WATER, AND THEN RETURNING.

THE FEELING OF LOSS THAT GRIPPED ME THEN

GRIPS ME STILL. HOW CAN I COMMUNICATE WHAT I FEEL

ABOUT ANY OF THIS? INSIDE, THEY GO ON

CONVERSING IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE.

                         I DECIDE TO WALK

ALONGSIDE THE RIVER. IT’S THE KIND OF NIGHT

THAT BRINGS MEN AND RIVERS CLOSE.

I GO FOR A WAYS, THEN STOP. REALIZING

THAT I HAVEN’T BEEN CLOSE. NOT

IN THE LONGEST TIME. THERE’S BEEN

THIS WAITING THAT’S GONE ALONG WITH ME

WHEREVER I GO. BUT THE HOPE WIDENING NOW

THAT SOMETHING WILL RISE UP AND SPLASH.

I WANT TO HEAR IT, AND MOVE ON.

THE PEN
THE PEN THAT TOLD THE TRUTH

WENT INTO THE WASHING MACHINE

FOR ITS TROUBLE. CAME OUT

AN HOUR LATER, AND WAS TOSSED

IN THE DRYER WITH JEANS

AND A WESTERN SHIRT. DAYS PASSED

WHILE IT LAY QUIETLY ON THE DESK

UNDER THE WINDOW. LAY THERE

THINKING IT WAS FINISHED.

WITHOUT A SINGLE CONVICTION

TO ITS NAME. IT DIDN’T HAVE

THE WILL TO GO ON, EVEN IF IT’D WANTED.

BUT ONE MORNING, AN HOUR OR SO

BEFORE SUNRISE, IT CAME TO LIFE

AND WROTE:

“THE DAMP FIELDS ASLEEP IN MOONLIGHT.”

THEN IT WAS STILL AGAIN.

ITS USEFULNESS IN THIS LIFE

CLEARLY AT AN END.

HE SHOOK IT AND WHACKED IT

ON THE DESK. THEN GAVE UP

ON IT, OR NEARLY.

ONCE MORE THOUGH, WITH THE GREATEST

EFFORT, IT SUMMONED ITS LAST

RESERVES. THIS IS WHAT IT WROTE:

“A LIGHT WIND, AND BEYOND THE WINDOW

TREES SWIMMING IN THE GOLDEN MORNING AIR.”

HE TRIED TO WRITE SOME MORE

BUT THAT WAS ALL. THE PEN

QUIT WORKING FOREVER.

BY AND BY IT WAS PUT

INTO THE STOVE ALONG WITH

OTHER JUNK. AND MUCH LATER

IT WAS ANOTHER PEN,

AN UNDISTINGUISHED PEN

THAT HADN’T PROVED ITSELF

YET, THAT FACILELY WROTE:

“DARKNESS GATHERS IN THE BRANCHES.

STAY INSIDE. KEEP STILL.”

THE PRIZE
HE WAS NEVER THE SAME, THEY SAID, AFTER THAT.

AND THEY WERE RIGHT. HE LEFT HOME, GLAD FOR HIS LIFE.

FELL UNDER THE SPELL OF ITALIAN OPERA.

A GOUT STOOL WAS BUILT INTO THE FRONT OF HIS SEDAN CHAIR.

HIS FAMILY WENT ON LIVING IN A HUT WITHOUT A CHIMNEY.

ONE SEASON VERY MUCH LIKE ANOTHER FOR THEM.

WHAT DID THEY KNOW?

A RIVER WOUND THROUGH THEIR VALLEY.

AT NIGHT THE CANDLES FLICKERED, BLINKING LIKE EYELASHES.

AS THOUGH TOBACCO SMOKE BURNED THEIR EYES.

BUT NOBODY SMOKED IN THAT STINKING PLACE.

NOBODY SANG OR WROTE CANTATAS.

WHEN HE DIED IT WAS THEY WHO HAD TO IDENTIFY THE BODY.

IT WAS TERRIBLE!

HIS FRIENDS COULDN’T REMEMBER HIM.

NOT EVEN WHAT HE’D LOOKED LIKE THE DAY BEFORE.

HIS FATHER SPAT AND RODE OFF TO KILL SQUIRRELS.

HIS SISTER CRADLED HIS HEAD IN HER ARMS.

HIS MOTHER WEPT AND WENT THROUGH HIS POCKETS.

NOTHING HAD CHANGED.

HE WAS BACK WHERE HE BELONGED.

AS THOUGH HE’D NEVER LEFT.

EASY ENOUGH TO SAY HE SHOULD HAVE DECLINED IT.

BUT WOULD YOU?

AN ACCOUNT
HE BEGAN THE POEM AT THE KITCHEN TABLE,

ONE LEG CROSSED OVER THE OTHER.

HE WROTE FOR A TIME, AS IF

ONLY HALF INTERESTED IN THE RESULT. IT WASN’T

AS IF THE WORLD DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH POEMS.

THE WORLD HAD PLENTY OF POEMS. BESIDES,

HE’D BEEN AWAY FOR MONTHS.

HE HADN’T EVEN READ A POEM IN MONTHS.

WHAT KIND OF LIFE WAS THIS? A LIFE

WHERE A MAN WAS TOO BUSY EVEN TO READ POEMS?

NO LIFE AT ALL. THEN HE LOOKED OUT THE WINDOW,

DOWN THE HILL TO FRANK’S HOUSE.

A NICE HOUSE SITUATED NEAR THE WATER.

HE REMEMBERED FRANK OPENING HIS DOOR

EVERY MORNING AT NINE O’CLOCK.

GOING OUT FOR HIS WALKS.

HE DREW NEARER THE TABLE, AND UNCROSSED HIS LEGS.

LAST NIGHT HE’D HEARD AN ACCOUNT

OF FRANK’S DEATH FROM ED, ANOTHER NEIGHBOR.

A MAN THE SAME AGE AS FRANK,

AND FRANK’S GOOD FRIEND. FRANK

AND HIS WIFE WATCHING TV. HILL STREET BLUES.

FRANK’S FAVORITE SHOW. WHEN HE GASPS

TWICE, IS THROWN BACK IN HIS CHAIR —

“AS IF HE’D BEEN ELECTROCUTED.” THAT FAST,

HE WAS DEAD. HIS COLOR DRAINING AWAY.

HE WAS GREY, TURNING BLACK. BETTY RUNS

OUT OF THE HOUSE IN HER ROBE. RUNS

TO A NEIGHBOR’S HOUSE WHERE A GIRL KNOWS

SOMETHING ABOUT CPR. SHE’S WATCHING

THE SAME SHOW! THEY RUN BACK

TO FRANK’S HOUSE. FRANK TOTALLY BLACK NOW,

IN HIS CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV.

THE COPS AND OTHER DESPERATE CHARACTERS

MOVING ACROSS THE SCREEN, RAISING THEIR VOICES,

YELLING AT EACH OTHER, WHILE THIS NEIGHBOR GIRL

HAULS FRANK OUT OF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR.

TEARS OPEN HIS SHIRT. GOES TO WORK.

FRANK BEING THE FIRST REAL-LIFE VICTIM

SHE’S EVER HAD.

                         SHE PLACES HER LIPS

ON FRANK’S ICY LIPS. A DEAD MAN’S LIPS. BLACK LIPS.

AND BLACK HIS FACE AND HANDS AND ARMS.

BLACK TOO HIS CHEST WHERE THE SHIRT’S BEEN TORN,

EXPOSING THE SPARSE HAIRS THAT GREW THERE.

LONG AFTER SHE MUST’VE KNOWN BETTER, SHE GOES ON

WITH IT. PRESSING HER LIPS AGAINST HIS

UNRESPONSIVE LIPS. THEN STOPPING TO BEAT ON HIM

WITH CLENCHED FISTS. PRESSING HER LIPS TO HIS AGAIN,

AND THEN AGAIN. EVEN AFTER IT’S TOO LATE AND IT

WAS CLEAR HE WASN’T COMING BACK, SHE WENT ON WITH IT.

THIS GIRL, BEATING ON HIM WITH HER FISTS, CALLING

HIM EVERY NAME SHE COULD THINK OF. WEEPING

WHEN THEY TOOK HIM AWAY

FROM HER. AND SOMEONE THOUGHT TO TURN OFF

THE IMAGES PULSING ACROSS THE SCREEN.

THE MEADOW
IN THE MEADOW THIS AFTERNOON, I FETCH

ANY NUMBER OF CRAZY MEMORIES. THAT

UNDERTAKER ASKING MY MOTHER DID SHE

WANT TO BUY THE ENTIRE SUIT TO BURY MY DAD IN,

OR JUST THE COAT? I DON’T

HAVE TO PROVIDE THE ANSWER TO THIS,

OR ANYTHING ELSE. BUT, HEY, HE WENT

INTO THE FURNACE WEARING HIS BRITCHES.

THIS MORNING I LOOKED AT HIS PICTURE.

BIG, HEAVYSET GUY IN THE LAST YEAR

OF HIS LIFE. HOLDING A MONSTER SALMON

IN FRONT OF THE SHACK WHERE HE LIVED

IN FORTUNA, CALIFORNIA. MY DAD.

HE’S NOTHING NOW. REDUCED TO A CUP OF ASHES,

AND SOME TINY BONES. NO WAY

IS THIS ANY WAY

TO END YOUR LIFE AS A MAN.

THOUGH AS HEMINGWAY CORRECTLY POINTED OUT,

ALL STORIES, IF CONTINUED FAR ENOUGH,

END IN DEATH. TRULY.

LORD, IT’S ALMOST FALL.

A FLOCK OF CANADA GEESE PASSES

HIGH OVERHEAD. THE LITTLE MARE LIFTS

HER HEAD, SHIVERS ONCE, GOES BACK

TO GRAZING. I THINK I WILL LIE DOWN

IN THIS SWEET GRASS. I’LL SHUT MY EYES

AND LISTEN TO WIND, AND THE SOUND OF WINGS.

JUST DREAM FOR AN HOUR, GLAD TO BE HERE

AND NOT THERE. THERE’S THAT. BUT ALSO

THE TERRIBLE UNDERSTANDING

THAT MEN I LOVED HAVE LEFT

FOR SOME OTHER, LESSER PLACE.

LOAFING
I LOOKED INTO THE ROOM A MOMENT AGO,

AND THIS IS WHAT I SAW —

MY CHAIR IN ITS PLACE BY THE WINDOW,

THE BOOK TURNED FACEDOWN ON THE TABLE.

AND ON THE SILL, THE CIGARETTE

LEFT BURNING IN ITS ASHTRAY.

MALINGERER! MY UNCLE YELLED AT ME

SO LONG AGO. HE WAS RIGHT.

I’VE SET ASIDE TIME TODAY,

SAME AS EVERY DAY,

FOR DOING NOTHING AT ALL.

SINEW
THE GIRL MINDING THE STORE.

SHE STANDS AT THE WINDOW

PICKING A PIECE OF PORK

FROM HER TEETH. IDLY

WATCHING THE MEN IN SERGE SUITS,

WAISTCOATS, AND TIES,

DAPPING FOR TROUT ON LOUGH GILL,

NEAR THE ISLE OF INNISFREE.

THE REMAINS OF HER MIDDAY MEAL

CONGEALING ON THE SILL.

THE AIR IS STILL AND WARM.

A CUCKOO CALLS.

CLOSE IN, A MAN IN A BOAT,

WEARING A HAT, LOOKS

TOWARD SHORE, THE LITTLE STORE,

AND THE GIRL. HE LOOKS, WHIPS

HIS LINE, AND LOOKS SOME MORE.

SHE LEANS CLOSER TO THE GLASS.

GOES OUT THEN TO THE LAKESIDE.

BUT IT’S THE CUCKOO IN THE BUSH

THAT HAS HER ATTENTION.

THE MAN STRIKES A FISH,

ALL BUSINESS NOW.

THE GIRL GOES ON WORKING

AT THE SINEW IN HER TEETH.

BUT SHE WATCHES THIS WELL-DRESSED

MAN REACHING OUT

TO SLIP A NET UNDER HIS FISH.

IN A MINUTE, SHYLY, HE FLOATS NEAR.

HOLDS UP HIS CATCH FOR THE GIRL’S PLEASURE.

DOFFS HIS HAT. SHE STIRS AND SMILES

A LITTLE. RAISES HER HAND.

A GESTURE WHICH STARTS THE BIRD

IN FLIGHT, TOWARD INNISFREE.

THE MAN CASTS AND CASTS AGAIN.

HIS LINE CUTS THE AIR. HIS FLY

TOUCHES THE WATER, AND WAITS.

BUT WHAT DOES THIS MAN

REALLY CARE FOR TROUT?

WHAT HE’LL TAKE

FROM THIS DAY IS THE MEMORY OF

A GIRL WORKING HER FINGER

INSIDE HER MOUTH AS THEIR GLANCES

MEET, AND A BIRD FLIES UP.

THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND SMILE.

IN THE STILL AFTERNOON.

WITH NOT A WORD LOST BETWEEN THEM.

WAITING
LEFT OFF THE HIGHWAY AND

DOWN THE HILL. AT THE

BOTTOM, HANG ANOTHER LEFT.

KEEP BEARING LEFT. THE ROAD

WILL MAKE A Y. LEFT AGAIN.

THERE’S A CREEK ON THE LEFT.

KEEP GOING. JUST BEFORE

THE ROAD ENDS, THERE’LL BE

ANOTHER ROAD. TAKE IT

AND NO OTHER. OTHERWISE,

YOUR LIFE WILL BE RUINED

FOREVER. THERE’S A LOG HOUSE

WITH A SHAKE ROOF, ON THE LEFT.

IT’S NOT THAT HOUSE. IT’S

THE NEXT HOUSE, JUST OVER

A RISE. THE HOUSE

WHERE TREES ARE LADEN WITH

FRUIT. WHERE PHLOX, FORSYTHIA,

AND MARIGOLD GROW. IT’S

THE HOUSE WHERE THE WOMAN

STANDS IN THE DOORWAY

WEARING SUN IN HER HAIR. THE ONE

WHO’S BEEN WAITING

ALL THIS TIME.

THE WOMAN WHO LOVES YOU.

THE ONE WHO CAN SAY,

“WHAT’S KEPT YOU?”






THE VULGARITIES OF RENEWAL, THE PROVOCATIONS OF THE SUN, OF FOLIAGE, OF SAP. . . . MY BLOOD DISINTEGRATES WHEN THE BUDS OPEN, WHEN THE BIRD AND THE BEAST FROLIC. . . . I ENVY THE MAD, THE SLEEPING DORMOUSE, THE BEAR’S WINTERS, THE SAGE’S DRYNESS; I WOULD EXCHANGE FOR THEIR TORPOR MY AGITATION, THE FRENZY OF A VAGUE MURDERER WHO DREAMS OF CRIMES THIS SIDE OF BLOOD. AND MORE THAN THEM ALL, HOW MUCH I ENVY THOSE EMPERORS OF THE DECADENCE, SULLEN AND CRUEL, WHO WERE STABBED AT THE HEIGHT OF THEIR CRIMINAL COURSE!

I GIVE MYSELF UP TO SPACE LIKE A BLIND MAN’S TEARS. WHOSE WILL AM 1, WHO WILLS IN ME? I WISH SOME DEMON WOULD- CONCEIVE A CONSPIRACY AGAINST MAN: I WOULD JOIN IT. TIRED OF PARTICIPATING IN THE OBSEQUIES OF MY DESIRES, I SHOULD AT LAST HAVE AN IDEAL EXCUSE, FOR ENNUI IS THE MARTYRDOM OF THOSE WHO LIVE AND DIE FOR NO BELIEF.

IRREFUTABLE DISAPPOINTMENT
EVERYTHING CONFIRMS IT, FEEDS IT; IT CROWNS—KNOWING, UNIMPEACHABLE—EVENTS, FEELINGS, THOUGHTS; NO MOMENT WHICH FAILS TO CONSECRATE IT, NO IMPULSE WHICH FAILS TO EMPOWER IT, NO REFLECTION WHICH FAILS TO REINFORCE IT. DIVINITY, WHOSE KINGDOM IS LIMITLESS, MORE POWERFUL THAN THE FATALITY WHICH SERVES AND ILLUSTRATES IT, HYPHEN BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH, IT UNITES, IDENTIFIES, AND FEEDS ON THEM BOTH. BESIDE ITS ARGUMENTS AND VERIFICATIONS, THE SCIENCES THEMSELVES SEEM A JUMBLE OF WHIMS. NOTHING CAN DIMINISH THE FERVOR OF ITS DISTASTES: WHAT TRUTHS, FLOURISHING IN A SPRING OF AXIOMS, COULD DEFY ITS VISIONARY DOGMATISM, ITS PROUD INSANITY? NO HEAT OF YOUTH NOR EVEN THE MIND’S DERANGEMENT RESISTS ITS CERTITUDES, AND ITS VICTORIES ARE PROCLAIMED WITH ONE AND THE SAME VOICE BY WISDOM AND BY MADNESS. BEFORE ITS SEAMLESS EMPIRE, BEFORE ITS LIMITLESS SOVEREIGNTY, OUR KNEES BEND: EVERYTHING BEGINS IN IGNORANCE OF IT, EVERYTHING ENDS BY YIELDING TO IT; NO ACTION EVADES IT, NONE FAILS TO BE LED BACK TO IT. THE LAST WORD HERE ON EARTH, IT ALONE DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. . .

IN THE SECRET OF MORALISTS
WHEN WE HAVE STUFFED THE UNIVERSE WITH MELANCHOLY, ALL WE HAVE LEFT TO LIGHT UP THE MIND WITH IS JOY, IMPOSSIBLE, RARE, FLASHING JOY; AND IT IS WHEN WE NO LONGER HOPE THAT WE SUFFER THE FASCINATION OF HOPE. LIFE—A GIFT GIVEN TO THE LIVING BY THOSE OBSESSED WITH DEATH. . . . SINCE THE DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHTS IS NOT THAT OF OUR HEARTS, WE SUSTAIN A SECRET INCLINATION FOR ALL THAT WE TRAMPLE DOWN. SAY A MAN REGISTERS THE CREAKING OF THE WORLD’S MACHINERY: IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS DREAMED TOO MUCH OF THE RESONANCE OF THE SPHERES; FAILING TO HEAR THEM, HE ABASES HIMSELF TO HEAR ONLY THE DIN AROUND HIM. BITTER WORDS EMANATE FROM A WOUNDED SENSIBILITY, FROM AN OFFENDED DELICACY. THE VENOM OF A LA ROCHEFOUCAULD, A CHAMFORT, WAS THE REVENGE THEY TOOK ON A WORLD DESIGNED FOR BRUTES. ALL GALL CONCEALS A REVENGE AND IS TRANSLATED INTO A SYSTEM: PESSIMISM—THAT CRUELTY OF THE CONQUERED WHO CANNOT FORGIVE LIFE FOR HAVING DECEIVED THEIR EXPECTATIONS.

THE GAIETY WHICH STRIKES MORTAL BLOWS .. . THE PLEASANTRY WHICH CONCEALS THE DAGGER UNDER A SMILE .. . I THINK OF CERTAIN IRONIES OF VOLTAIRE, CERTAIN RETORTS OF RIVAROL, THE STINGING WORDS OF MME. DU DEFFAND, THE JEERS WHICH SHOW THROUGH SO MUCH ELEGANCE, THE AGGRESSIVE FRIVOLITY OF THE SALONS, THE SALLIES WHICH ENTERTAIN AND SLAUGHTER, THE BITTERNESS CONTAINED IN AN EXCESS OF CIVILITY. . . . AND I THINK OF AN IDEAL MORALIST—A COMBINATION OF CYNICISM AND LYRIC ARDOR—EXALTED AND ICY, VAGUE AND INCISIVE, AS CLOSE TO ROUSSEAU’S REVERIES AS TO LACIOS' LIAISONS, OR UNITING IN HIMSELF VAUVENARGUES AND SADE, TACT AND TORMENT. . . . OBSERVER OF MORES IN HIMSELF HAVING NO NEED TO SEEK ELSEWHERE, THE LEAST ATTENTION ON HOME GROUNDS WOULD SHOW HIM THE CONTRADICTIONS OF LIFE, ALL OF WHOSE ASPECTS HE WOULD REFLECT SO WELL THAT, ASHAMED OF DUPLICATION, IT WOULD DISAPPEAR. . . .

NO ATTENTION WHOSE EXERCISE FAILS TO LEAD TO AN ACT OF ANNIHILATION: THIS IS THE FATALITY OF OBSERVATION, WITH ALL THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH DERIVE FROM IT FOR THE OBSERVER, FROM THE CLASSICAL MORALIST DOWN TO PROUST. EVERYTHING DISSOLVES UNDER THE SEARCHING EYE: PASSIONS, LONG ATTACHMENTS, ARDORS ARE THE CHARACTERISTIC OF SIMPLE MINDS, FAITHFUL TO OTHERS AND TO THEMSELVES A TOUCH OF LUCIDITY IN THE “HEART” MAKES IT THE SEAT OF FEIGNED FEELINGS AND TURNS THE LOVER INTO ADOLPHE AND THE DISCONTENT INTO RENÉ. LOVING, WE DO NOT EXAMINE LOVE; ACTING, WE DO NOT MEDITATE UPON ACTION; IF I STUDY MY “NEIGHBOR” IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS CEASED TO BE MY NEIGHBOR, AND I AM NO LONGER “MYSELF” IF I ANALYZE MYSELF: I BECOME AN OBJECT ALONG WITH ALL THE REST. THE BELIEVER WHO WEIGHS HIS FAITH ENDS BY PUTTING GOD IN THE SCALES, AND SAFEGUARDS HIS FERVOR ONLY OUT OF FEAR OF LOSING IT. PLACED AT THE ANTIPODES OF NAÏVETE, OF INTEGRAL AND AUTHENTIC EXISTENCE, THE MORALIST EXHAUSTS HIMSELF IN A VIS-Á-VIS WITH HIMSELF AND WITH OTHERS: COMEDIAN, MICROCOSM OF SECOND THOUGHTS, HE DOES NOT ENDURE THE ARTIFICE WHICH MEN, IN ORDER TO LIVE, SPONTANEOUSLY ACCEPT AND INCORPORATE IN THEIR NATURE. EVERYTHING SEEMS CONVENTION: HE DIVULGES THE MOTIVES OF FEELINGS AND ACTIONS, HE UNMASKS THE SIMULACRA OF CIVILIZATION, BECAUSE HE SUFFERS AT HAVING GLIMPSED AND GONE BEYOND THEM; FOR THESE SIMULACRA GIVE LIFE, THEY ARE LIFE, WHEREAS HIS EXISTENCE, IN CONTEMPLATING THEM, STRAYS INTO THE SEARCH FOR A “NATURE” WHICH DOES NOT EXIST AND WHICH, IF IT DID, WOULD BE AS ALIEN TO HIM AS THE ARTIFICES WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDED TO IT. ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY REDUCED TO ITS ELEMENTS, EXPLAINED AND DISSECTED, INVOLVES AN OPERATION MUCH DEADLIER TO THE OPERATOR THAN TO THE VICTIM. WE LIQUIDATE OUR FEELINGS BY PURSUING THEIR DETOURS, AND OUR IMPULSES IF WE AMBUSH THEIR TRAJECTORY; AND WHEN WE DETAIL THE MOVEMENTS OF OTHERS, IT IS NOT THEY WHO LOSE THEIR WAY. . . . EVERYTHING WE DO NOT PARTICIPATE IN SEEMS UNREASONABLE; BUT THOSE WHO MOVE CANNOT FAIL TO ADVANCE, WHEREAS THE OBSERVER, WHICHEVER WAY HE TURNS, REGISTERS THEIR FUTILE TRIUMPH ONLY TO EXCUSE HIS OWN DEFEAT. THIS IS BECAUSE THERE IS LIFE ONLY IN THE INATTENTION TO LIFE.

MONASTIC FANTASY
THOSE DAYS WHEN WOMEN TOOK THE VEIL TO CONCEAL FROM THE WORLD, AND AS IF FROM THEMSELVES, THE ADVANCES OF AGE, THE DIMINUTION OF THEIR BEAUTY, THE FADING OF THEIR CHARMS . . . WHEN MEN, WEARY OF FAME AND CEREMONY, LEFT THE COURT TO TAKE REFUGE IN DEVOTION. . . . THE FASHION OF CONVERSION FOR DISCRETION’S SAKE VANISHED WITH THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY: PASCAL’S SHADOW AND JACQUELINE’S SHADE FELL, LIKE INVISIBLE GLAMORS, OVER THE MEREST COURTESAN, OVER THE MOST FRIVOLOUS BEAUTY. BUT PORT-ROYAL HAS BEEN DESTROYED FOREVER, AND WITH IT, THE PLACES FAVORABLE TO DISCREET AND SOLITARY AGONIES. NO MORE COQUETRY OF THE CONVENT: WHERE NOW TO LOOK, IN ORDER TO SOFTEN OUR DEGRADATIONS, FOR A CONTEXT AT ONCE DIM AND SUMPTUOUS? AN EPICUREAN LIKE SAINT-EVREMOND IMAGINED ONE TO HIS LIKING, AND AS COMFORTING AND LAX AS HIS OWN SAVOIR-VIVRE. IN THOSE DAYS, ONE STILL HAD TO TAKE GOD INTO ACCOUNT, ADJUST HIM TO DISBELIEF, INCLUDE HIM IN SOLITUDE. A TRANSACTION CRAMMED WITH CHARM, IRREMEDIABLY VANISHED! WE LACK CLOISTERS AS DISPOSSESSED, AS VACANT AS OUR SOULS, IN ORDER TO LOSE OURSELVES THERE WITHOUT THE ATTENDANCE OF THE HEAVENS, AND IN A PURITY OF ABSENT IDEALS, CLOISTERS BEFITTING THE DISABUSED ANGELS WHO, IN THEIR FALL, BY DINT OF VANQUISHED ILLUSIONS, WOULD REMAIN STILL IMMACULATE. WE LONG FOR A VOGUE OF RETREATS IN AN ETERNITY WITHOUT FAITH, AN ASSUMPTION OF THE HABIT IN NOTHINGNESS, AN ORDER RELEASED FROM MYSTERIES, AND FROM WHICH NO “BROTHER” WOULD CLAIM ANYTHING, DISDAINING HIS SALVATION EVEN AS THAT OF OTHERS, AN ORDER OF IMPOSSIBLE SALVATION. . . .

IN HONOR OF MADNESS
. . . BETTER I WERE DISTRACT:
SO SHOULD MY THOUGHTS HE SEVER'D FRONT MY GRIEFS.
—KING LEAR

THE EXCLAMATION IS WRUNG FROM GLOUCESTER BY LEAR’S MADNESS. . . . IN ORDER TO SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM OUR GRIEFS, OUR LAST RESORT IS DELIRIUM; SUBJECT TO ITS DISTRACTIONS, WE NO LONGER MEET OUR AFFLICTIONS: PARALLEL TO OUR PAINS AND ADJACENT TO OUR MELANCHOLIES, WE DIVAGATE IN A SALUTARY DARKNESS. WHEN WE CURSE THAT ITCH CALLED LIFE, AND WHEN WE ARE WEARY OF THE SCABS OF DURATION, THE LUNATIC’S ASSURANCE AMID HIS TRIBULATIONS BECOMES A TEMPTATION AND A MODEL: LET SOME KIND FATE RID US OF OUR REASON! NO ESCAPE SO LONG AS THE INTELLECT REMAINS ATTENTIVE TO THE HEART’S IMPULSES, SO LONG AS IT DOES NOT BREAK THE HABIT! I ASPIRE TO THE IDIOT’S NIGHTS, TO HIS MINERAL SUFFERINGS, TO THE BLISS OF GROANING WITH INDIFFERENCE AS IF THEY WERE SOMEONE ELSE’S GROANS, TO THE CALVARY IN WHICH WE ARE STRANGERS TO OURSELVES, IN WHICH OUR OWN CRIES COME FROM ELSEWHERE, TO AN ANONYMOUS HELL WHERE WE DANCE AND JEER AS WE DESTROY OURSELVES. TO LIVE AND DIE IN THE THIRD PERSON .. . TO BE EXILED - IN MYSELF, TO DISSOCIATE MYSELF FROM MY NAME, FOREVER DISTRACTED FROM THE MAN I WAS .. . TO ATTAIN AT LAST—SINCE LIFE IS ENDURABLE ONLY AT THIS PRICE—THE WISDOM OF DEMENTIA. . . .

MY HEROES
WHEN WE ARE YOUNG WE LOOK FOR HEROES. I HAVE HAD MINE: KLEIST, KAROLINE VON GÜNDERODE, NERVAL, OTTO WEININGER. . . . INTOXICATED BY THEIR SUICIDES, I WAS CERTAIN THAT THEY ALONE HAD GONE TO THE END, THAT THEY DREW, IN DEATH, THE RIGHT CONCLUSION FROM THEIR THWARTED OR FULFILLED LOVES, FROM THEIR BROKEN MINDS OR PHILOSOPHIC PAIN. THAT A MAN SHOULD SURVIVE HIS PASSION WAS ENOUGH TO MAKE HIM CONTEMPTIBLE OR ABJECT IN MY EYES: WHICH IS TO SAY THAT HUMANITY WAS SUPERFLUOUS. I DISCOVERED IN IT AN INFINITESIMAL NUMBER OF LOFTY RESOLUTIONS AND SO MUCH COMPROMISE WITH LIFE THAT I TURNED AWAY FROM IT, DETERMINED TO PUT AN END TO IT ALL BEFORE I WAS THIRTY. BUT AS THE YEARS WENT BY, I LOST THE PRIDE OF YOUTH: EACH DAY, LIKE A LESSON IN HUMILITY, I REMINDED MYSELF THAT I WAS STILL ALIVE, THAT I WAS BETRAYING MY DREAMS AMONG MEN ROTTEN WITH . . . LIFE. EXASPERATED BY THE EXPECTATION OF NO LONGER EXISTING, I CONSIDERED IT A DUTY TO CLEAVE MY FLESH WHEN DAWN BROKE AFTER A NIGHT OF LOVE, AND THAT IT WAS A NAMELESS DEGRADATION TO SULLY BY MEMORY AN EXCESS OF SIGHS. OR, AT OTHER MOMENTS, HOW WAS ONE TO INSULT DURATION FURTHER, WHEN ONE HAD GRASPED EVERYTHING IN A DILATION WHICH ENTHRONES PRIDE IN THE VERY HEAVENS? I THOUGHT THAT THE ONLY ACTION A MAN COULD PERFORM WITHOUT SHAME WAS TO TAKE HIS LIFE, THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO DIMINISH HIMSELF IN THE SUCCESSION OF DAYS AND THE INERTIA OF MISERY. NO ELECT, I KEPT TELLING MYSELF, BUT THOSE WHO COMMITTED SUICIDE. EVEN NOW, I HAVE MORE ESTEEM FOR A CONCIERGE WHO HANGS HIMSELF THAN FOR A LIVING POET. MAN IS PROVISIONALLY EXEMPT FROM SUICIDE: THAT IS HIS ONE GLORY, HIS ONE EXCUSE. BUT HE IS NOT AWARE OF IT, AND CALLS COWARDICE THE COURAGE OF THOSE WHO DARED TO RAISE THEMSELVES BY DEATH ABOVE THEMSELVES. WE ARE BOUND TOGETHER BY A TACIT PACT TO GO ON TO THE LAST BREATH: THIS PACT WHICH CEMENTS OUR SOLIDARITY DOOMS US NONETHELESS—OUR ENTIRE RACE IS STRICKEN BY ITS INFAMY. WITHOUT SUICIDE, NO SALVATION. STRANGE! THAT DEATH, THOUGH ETERNAL, HAS NOT BECOME PART OF OUR “BEHAVIOR": SOLE REALITY, IT CANNOT BECOME A VOGUE. THUS, AS LIVING MEN, WE ARE ALL RETARDED. . . .

THE SIMPLE-MINDED
CONSIDER THE ACCENT WITH WHICH A MAN UTTERS THE WORD “TRUTH,” THE INFLECTION OF ASSURANCE OR RESERVE HE USES, THE EXPRESSION OF BELIEVING OR DOUBTING IT, AND YOU WILL BE EDIFIED AS TO THE NATURE OF HIS OPINIONS AND THE QUALITY OF HIS MIND. NO WORD IS EMPTIER; YET MEN MAKE AN IDOL OF IT AND CONVERT ITS NON-MEANING AT ONCE INTO A CRITERION AND A GOAL OF THOUGHT. THIS SUPERSTITION—WHICH EXCUSES THE VULGARIAN AND DISQUALIFIES THE PHILOSOPHER—RESULTS FROM THE ENCROACHMENT OF HOPE UPON LOGIC. YOU ARE TOLD OVER AND OVER: TRUTH IS INACCESSIBLE; YET IT MUST BE SEARCHED FOR, ASPIRED TO, FOUGHT OVER. BEHOLD A RESTRICTION WHICH FAILS TO SEPARATE YOU FROM THOSE WHO DECLARE THEY HAVE FOUND IT: THE MAIN THING IS TO BELIEVE IT IS POSSIBLE: TO POSSESS TRUTH OR TO ASPIRE TO IT ARE TWO ACTIONS WHICH PROCEED FROM ONE AND THE SAME ATTITUDE. WE MAKE AN EXCEPTION OF ONE WORD AS OF ANOTHER: TERRIBLE USURPATION OF LANGUAGE! I CALL SIMPLE-MINDED ANY MAN WHO SPEAKS OF TRUTH WITH CONVICTION: IT IS BECAUSE HE HAS CAPITAL LETTERS IN RESERVE AND EMPLOYS THEM NAIVELY, WITHOUT DECEPTION, WITHOUT DISDAIN. AS FOR THE PHILOSOPHER, HIS SLIGHTEST INDULGENCE IN THIS IDOLATRY EXPOSES HIM: THE CITIZEN IN HIM HAS WON OUT OVER THE SOLITARY. HOPE EMERGING FROM A THOUGHT—THAT SADDENS US, OR MAKES US SMILE. . . . THERE IS AN INDECENCY ABOUT PUTTING TOO MUCH SOUL IN SUCH WORDS: THE CHILDISHNESS OF ANY ENTHUSIASM FOR KNOWLEDGE. . . . AND IT IS TIME THAT PHILOSOPHY, CASTING DISCREDIT UPON TRUTH, FREED ITSELF FROM ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.

POVERTY: MENTAL STIMULANT
TO KEEP THE MIND VIGILANT, THERE IS ONLY COFFEE, DISEASE, INSOMNIA, OR THE OBSESSION OF DEATH; POVERTY CONTRIBUTES TO THIS CONDITION IN EQUAL MEASURE, IF NOT MORE EFFECTIVELY: TERROR OF TOMORROW AS MUCH AS THAT OF ETERNITY, MONEY TROUBLES AS MUCH AS METAPHYSICAL FEARS, EXCLUDE REPOSE AND OBLIVION. ALL OUR HUMILIATIONS COME FROM THE FACT THAT WE CANNOT BRING OURSELVES TO DIE OF HUNGER. WE PAY DEARLY FOR THIS COWARDICE. TO BE DEPENDENT ON MEN, WITHOUT THE VOCATION OF BEGGARS! TO ABASE OURSELVES BEFORE THESE DRESSED-UP, LUCKY, INFATUATED MARMOSETS! TO BE AT THE MERCY OF THESE CARICATURES UNWORTHY OF CONTEMPT! IT IS THE SHAME OF SEEKING ANYTHING WHICH EXCITES THE DESIRE TO ANNIHILATE THIS PLANET, WITH ITS HIERARCHIES AND THE DEGRADATIONS THEY INVOLVE. SOCIETY IS NOT A DISEASE, IT IS A DISASTER: WHAT A STUPID MIRACLE THAT ONE CAN LIVE IN IT! WHEN WE CONTEMPLATE IT, BETWEEN RAGE AND INDIFFERENCE, IT BECOMES INEXPLICABLE THAT NO ONE HAS BEEN ABLE TO DEMOLISH ITS STRUCTURE, THAT HITHERTO THERE HAVE NOT BEEN MINDS DESPERATE AND DECENT ENOUGH TO RAZE IT TO THE GROUND WITHOUT A TRACE.

THERE IS MORE THAN ONE RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN BEGGING FOR A COIN IN THE CITY AND WAITING FOR AN ANSWER FROM THE SILENCE OF THE UNIVERSE. AVARICE PRESIDES OVER MEN’S HEARTS AND OVER MATTER. AWAY WITH THIS STINGY EXISTENCE! IT HOARDS MONEY AND MYSTERIES: PURSES ARE AS INACCESSIBLE AS THE DEPTHS OF THE UNKNOWN. BUT—MAYBE SOMEDAY THAT UNKNOWN WILL REVEAL ITSELF AND OPEN ITS TREASURIES; NEVER, SO LONG AS THERE IS BLOOD IN HIS VEINS, WILL THE RICH MAN UNEARTH HIS WEALTH. . . . HE WILL CONFESS HIS SHAMES, HIS VICES, HIS CRIMES: HE WILL LIE ABOUT HIS FORTUNE; HE WILL MAKE YOU EVERY CONFIDENCE, HAND YOU HIS LIFE: YOU WILL NOT SHARE HIS LAST SECRET, HIS PECUNIARY SECRET. . . .

POVERTY IS NOT A TRANSITORY STATE: IT COINCIDES WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT, WHATEVER HAPPENS, YOU WILL NEVER HAVE ANYTHING, THAT YOU ARE BORN ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE CIRCUIT OF GOODS, THAT YOU MUST STRUGGLE FOR EVEN A BREATH, AND CONQUER AIR ITSELF, AND HOPE, AND SLEEP, AND THAT EVEN WHEN SOCIETY DISAPPEARS, NATURE WILL BE NO LESS INCLEMENT, NO LESS PERVERTED. NO PATERNAL PRINCIPLE WATCHED OVER THE CREATION; EVERYWHERE, BURIED TREASURES; BEHOLD THE MISER AS DEMIURGE, THE GOD ON HIGH A SLY SKINFLINT. IT IS HE WHO IMPLANTED IN YOU THE TERROR OF TOMORROW: IT IS SCARCELY SURPRISING THAT RELIGION ITSELF SHOULD BE A FORM OF THIS TERROR.

FOR THE PAUPERS OF ETERNITY, POVERTY IS A KIND OF STIMULANT THEY HAVE TAKEN ONCE AND FOR ALL, WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ANTIDOTE, OR A KIND OF INNATE AWARENESS WHICH, BEFORE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE, COULD DESCRIBE ITS INFERNO. . . .

INVOCATION TO INSOMNIA
I WAS SEVENTEEN, AND I BELIEVED IN PHILOSOPHY. WHAT DID NOT RELATE TO PHILOSOPHY SEEMED TO ME EITHER A SIN OR SLOPS: POETS? JUGGLERS GOOD FOR THE AMUSEMENT OF TRIVIAL WOMEN; ACTION? IMBECILITY IN DELIRIUM; LOVE, DEATH? LOW EXCUSES REJECTING THE HONOR OF CONCEPTS. FOUL ODORS OF A UNIVERSE UNWORTHY OF THE MIND’S PERFUME. . . . THE CONCRETE, WHAT AN ABOMINATION! DELIGHT OR SUFFERING, WHAT SHAMES! ONLY ABSTRACTION SEEMED TO PALPITATE WITH LIFE: I GAVE MYSELF UP TO ANCILLARY EXPLOITS LEST SOME NOBLER OBJECT MIGHT MAKE ME INFRINGE MY PRINCIPLES AND SUBMIT TO THE DEGRADATIONS OF THE HEART. I TOLD MYSELF OVER AND OVER: ONLY THE BROTHEL IS COMPATIBLE WITH METAPHYSICS; AND I COVETED—TO ESCAPE POETRY—THE EYES OF HOUSEMAIDS, THE SIGHS OF WHORES.

. . . WHEN YOU CAME, INSOMNIA, TO SHAKE MY FLESH AND MY PRIDE, YOU WHO TRANSFORM THE CHILDISH BRUTE, GIVE NUANCE TO THE INSTINCTS, FOCUS TO DREAMS, YOU WHO IN A SINGLE NIGHT GRANT MORE KNOWLEDGE THAN DAYS SPENT IN REPOSE, AND, TO REDDENED EYELIDS, REVEAL YOURSELF A MORE IMPORTANT EVENT THAN THE NAMELESS DISEASES OR THE DISASTERS OF TIME! YOU MADE ME HEAR THE SNORE OF HEALTH, HUMAN BEINGS PLUNGED INTO SONOROUS OBLIVION, WHILE MY SOLITUDE ENGROSSED THE SURROUNDING DARK AND BECAME HUGER THAN THE NIGHT. EVERYTHING SLEPT, SLEPT FOREVER. THERE WAS NO DAWN: I SHALL LIE AWAKE THIS WAY UNTIL THE END OF TIME: THEY WILL WAIT FOR ME THEN TO ASK ME TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BLANK SPACE OF MY DREAMS. . . . EACH NIGHT WAS LIKE THE OTHERS, EACH NIGHT WAS ETERNAL. AND I FELT ONE WITH ALL THOSE WHO CANNOT SLEEP, WITH ALL THOSE UNKNOWN BROTHERS. LIKE THE CORRUPT AND THE FANATICAL, I HAD A SECRET; LIKE THEM I BELONGED TO A CLAN TO WHICH EVERYTHING COULD BE EXCUSED, GIVEN, SACRIFICED: THE CLAN OF THE SLEEPLESS. I GRANTED GENIUS TO THE FIRST-COMER WHOSE EYELIDS WERE HEAVY WITH FATIGUE, AND ADMIRED NO MIND THAT COULD SLEEP, WERE IT THE GLORY OF THE STATE, OF ART OR OF LETTERS. I WOULD HAVE WORSHIPPED A TYRANT WHO—TO TAKE REVENGE ON HIS NIGHTS—WOULD HAVE FORBIDDEN REST, PUNISHED OBLIVION, PRESCRIBED DISASTER AND FEVERS.

AND IT WAS THEN THAT I APPEALED TO PHILOSOPHY; BUT THERE IS NO IDEA WHICH COMFORTS IN THE DARK, NO SYSTEM WHICH RESISTS THOSE VIGILS. THE ANALYSES OF INSOMNIA UNDO ALL CERTAINTIES. WEARY OF SUCH DESTRUCTION, I CAME TO THE POINT OF TELLING MYSELF: NO MORE VACILLATION, SLEEP OR DIE . . . RECONQUER SLEEP OR DISAPPEAR. . . .

BUT THIS RECONQUEST IS NO EASY MATTER: WHEN YOU COME CLOSE TO IT, YOU REALIZE HOW DEEPLY YOU HAVE BEEN MARKED BY THE NIGHTS. YOU LOVE? . . . YOUR IMPULSES WILL BE FOREVER CORRUPTED; YOU WILL EMERGE FROM EACH “ECSTASY” LIKE A SCARECROW OF PLEASURE; YOU WILL CONFRONT THE GLANCES OF YOUR TOO IMMEDIATE COMPANION WITH A CRIMINAL COUNTENANCE; YOU WILL ANSWER HER SINCERE GESTURES WITH THE IRRITATIONS OF AN ENVENOMED PLEASURE; HER INNOCENCE WITH A GUILTY POETRY, FOR EVERYTHING FOR YOU WILL BECOME POETRY, BUT A POETRY OF TRANSGRESSION. . . . CRYSTALLINE IDEAS, HAPPY SEQUENCE OF THOUGHTS? YOU WILL NOT THINK ANY MORE: IT WILL BE AN EXPLOSION, A LAVA OF CONCEPTS, WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE AND WITHOUT ORDER, A VOMIT OF AGGRESSIVE CONCEPTS SPEWED FROM YOUR GUTS, PUNISHMENTS THE FLESH INFLICTS UPON ITSELF, THE MIND BEING A VICTIM OF THE HUMORS AND OUT OF THE QUESTION. . . . YOU WILL SUFFER FROM EVERYTHING, AND TO EXCESS: THE WINDS WILL SEEM GALES; EVERY TOUCH A DAGGER, SMILES, SLAPS; TRIFLES, CATACLYSMS. WAKING MAY COME TO AN END, BUT ITS LIGHT SURVIVES WITHIN YOU; ONE DOES NOT SEE IN THE DARK WITH IMPUNITY, ONE DOES NOT GATHER ITS LESSONS WITHOUT DANGER; THERE ARE EYES WHICH CAN NO LONGER LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE SUN, AND SOULS AFFLICTED BY NIGHTS FROM WHICH THEY WILL NEVER RECOVER. . . .

PROFILE OF THE WICKED MAN
WHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS NOT HAVING DONE MORE EVIL THAN HE MIGHT OR MUST, FOR HIS NOT COMMITTING MURDER, WREAKING SUBTLER VENGEANCES, FOR NOT HAVING OBEYED THE INJUNCTIONS OF THE BLOOD RUSHING TO HIS HEAD? HIS MOODS, HIS EDUCATION? CERTAINLY NOT, AND STILL LESS A NATIVE GOODNESS; BUT MERELY THE PRESENCE OF THE IDEA OF DEATH. INCLINED TO FORGIVE NO ONE ANYTHING, HE PARDONS ALL; THE SLIGHTEST INSULT AROUSES HIS INSTINCTS; HE FORGETS IT THE NEXT MOMENT. ENOUGH FOR HIM TO IMAGINE HIS OWN CORPSE AND TO APPLY THIS METHOD TO OTHERS IN ORDER TO BE SUDDENLY SOOTHED; THE FIGURE OF WHAT DECOMPOSES MAKES HIM GOOD—AND COWARDLY: NO WISDOM (NOR CHARITY) WITHOUT MACABRE OBSESSIONS. THE HEALTHY MAN, PROUD OF EXISTING, TAKES HIS REVENGE, LISTENS TO HIS BLOOD AND HIS NERVES, HEEDS HIS PREJUDICES, ANSWERS, BLOW FOR BLOW, AND KILLS. BUT THE MIND UNDERMINED BY THE FEAR OF DEATH NO LONGER REACTS TO EXTERNAL SOLICITATIONS: IT SKETCHES OUT ACTIONS AND LEAVES THEM UNFINISHED; REFLECTS UPON HONOR, AND LOSES IT . . . TRIES OUT PASSIONS, AND DISSECTS THEM. . . . THIS DREAD WHICH ACCOMPANIES ITS GESTURES ENERVATES THEIR VIGOR; ITS DESIRES EXPIRE BEFORE THE VISION OF UNIVERSAL INSIGNIFICANCE. FILLED WITH HATRED BY NECESSITY, UNABLE TO BE SO BY CONVICTION, THE PLOTS AND CRIMES OF SUCH A MAN ARE HALTED IN MID-COURSE; LIKE ALL MEN, HE CONCEALS A MURDERER INSIDE HIMSELF, BUT A MURDERER IMBUED WITH RESIGNATION, AND TOO WEARY TO CRUSH HIS ENEMIES OR TO CREATE NEW ONES. HE DREAMS, FOREHEAD ON HIS DAGGER, AND AS THOUGH DISAPPOINTED, BEFORE THEY HAPPEN, BY EVERY CRIME; CONSIDERED A GOOD MAN BY EVERYONE, HE WOULD BE WICKED IF HE DID NOT FIND IT FUTILE TO BE SO.

VIEWS ON TOLERANCE
SIGNS OF LIFE: CRUELTY, FANATICISM, INTOLERANCE; SIGHS OF DECADENCE: AMENITY, UNDERSTANDING, INDULGENCE. .. . SO LONG AS AN INSTITUTION IS BASED ON STRONG INSTINCTS, IT ADMITS NEITHER ENEMIES NOR HERETICS: IT MASSACRES, BURNS, OR IMPRISONS THEM. STAKES, SCAFFOLDS, PRISONS! IT IS NOT WICKEDNESS WHICH INVENTED THEM, BUT CONVICTION, ANY UTTER CONVICTION. ONCE A BELIEF IS ESTABLISHED THE POLICE WILL GUARANTEE ITS “TRUTH” SOONER OR LATER. JESUS—ONCE HE WANTED TO TRIUMPH AMONG MEN—SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORESEE TORQUEMADA, INELUCTABLE CONSEQUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY TRANSLATED INTO HISTORY. AND IF THE LAMB FAILED TO ANTICIPATE THE TORTURER OF THE CROSS, HIS FUTURE DEFENDER, THEN HE DESERVES HIS NICKNAME. BY THE INQUISITION, THE CHURCH PROVED THAT IT STILL POSSESSED ENORMOUS VITALITY; SIMILARLY, THE KINGS BY THEIR “ROYAL WILL” ALL AUTHORITIES HAVE THEIR BASTILLE: THE MORE POWERFUL AN INSTITUTION, THE LESS HUMANE. THE ENERGY OF A PERIOD IS MEASURED BY THE BEINGS THAT SUFFER IN IT, AND IT IS BY THE VICTIMS IT PROVOKES THAT A RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL BELIEF IS AFFIRMED, BESTIALITY BEING THE PRIMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF ANY SUCCESS IN TIME. HEADS FALL WHERE AN IDEA PREVAILS; IT CAN PREVAIL ONLY AT THE EXPENSE OF OTHER IDEAS AND OF THE HEADS WHICH CONCEIVED OR DEFENDED THEM.

HISTORY CONFIRMS SKEPTICISM; YET IT IS AND LIVES ONLY BY TRAMPLING OVER IT; NO EVENT RISES OUT OF DOUBT, BUT ALL CONSIDERATIONS OF EVENTS LEAD TO IT AND JUSTIFY IT. WHICH IS TO SAY THAT TOLERANCE—SUPREME GOOD ON EARTH—IS AT THE SAME TIME THE SUPREME EVIL TO ADMIT ALL POINTS OF VIEW, THE MOST DISPARATE BELIEFS, THE MOST CONTRADICTORY OPINIONS, PRESUPPOSES A GENERAL STATE OF LASSITUDE AND STERILITY. WHENCE WE ARRIVE AT THIS MIRACLE: THE ADVERSARIES COEXIST—BUT PRECISELY BECAUSE THEY CAN NO LONGER BE ADVERSARIES; OPPOSING DOCTRINES RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER’S MERITS BECAUSE NONE HAS THE VIGOR TO ASSERT ITSELF. A RELIGION DIES WHEN IT TOLERATES TRUTHS WHICH EXCLUDE IT; AND THE GOD IN WHOSE NAME ONE NO LONGER KILLS IS DEAD INDEED. AN ABSOLUTE PERISHES: A VAGUE GLOW OF EARTHLY PARADISE APPEARS, A FUGITIVE GLEAM, FOR INTOLERANCE CONSTITUTES THE LAW OF HUMAN AFFAIRS. COLLECTIVITIES ARE REINFORCED ONLY UNDER TYRANNIES, AND DISINTEGRATE IN A REGIME OF CLEMENCY; THEN, IN A BURST OF ENERGY, THEY BEGIN TO STRANGLE THEIR LIBERTIES AND TO WORSHIP THEIR JAILERS, CROWNED OR COMMONERS.

THE PERIODS OF FEAR PREDOMINATE OVER THOSE OF CALM; MAN IS MUCH MORE VEXED BY THE ABSENCE THAN BY THE PROFUSION OF EVENTS; THUS HISTORY IS THE BLOODY PRODUCT OF HIS REJECTION OF BOREDOM.

SARTORIAL PHILOSOPHY
WITH WHAT TENDERNESS, AND WHAT JEALOUSY, MY THOUGHTS TURN TOWARD THE DESERT FATHERS AND TOWARD THE CYNICS! THE ABJECTION OF OWNING THE MEREST OBJECT: THIS TABLE, THIS BED, THESE RAGS. . . . CLOTHES GET BETWEEN US AND NOTHINGNESS. LOOK AT YOUR BODY IN A MIRROR: YOU WILL REALIZE THAT YOU ARE MORTAL; RUN YOUR FINGERS OVER YOUR RIBS AS THOUGH ACROSS A GUITAR, AND YOU WILL SEE HOW CLOSE YOU ARE TO THE GRAVE. IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE DRESSED THAT WE ENTERTAIN IMMORTALITY: HOW CAN WE DIE WHEN WE WEAR A NECKTIE? THE CORPSE THAT DECKS ITSELF OUT FAILS TO RECOGNIZE ITSELF, AND IMAGINING ETERNITY, APPROPRIATES THAT ILLUSION. FLESH COVERS THE SKELETON, CLOTHES COVER THE FLESH: SUBTERFUGE OF NATURE AND OF MAN, INSTINCTIVE AND CONVENTIONAL DECEPTIONS: A GENTLEMAN CANNOT BE KNEADED OF CLAY AND DUST. . . . DIGNITY, DECENCY—SO MANY ESCAPES IN THE FACE OF THE IRREMEDIABLE. AND WHEN YOU PUT ON A HAT, WHO WOULD SAY THAT YOU HAVE SOJOURNED AMONG ENTRAILS OR THAT THE WORMS WILL GORGE ON YOUR FAT?

. . . THIS IS WHY I SHALL ABANDON THESE RAGS AND, CASTING AWAY THE MASK OF MY DAYS, FLEE THE TIME WHEN, IN COLLUSION WITH THE OTHERS, I STRIVE TO BETRAY MYSELF. THERE WAS A TIME WHEN SOLITARIES STRIPPED THEMSELVES OF EVERYTHING, IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY WITH THEMSELVES; IN THE DESERT OR IN THE STREET, DELIGHTING IN THEIR NAKEDNESS, THEY ATTAINED TO THE SUPREME FORTUNE: THEY WERE THE EQUALS OF THE DEAD. . . .

AMONG THE DREGS
TO CONSOLE MYSELF FOR THE REMORSE OF SLOTH, I TAKE THE PATH TO THE LOWER DEPTHS, IMPATIENT TO DEGRADE MYSELF AND IDENTIFY WITH THE GUTTER. I KNOW THESE GRANDILOQUENT, STINKING, SNEERING BUMS; ENGULFED IN THEIR FILTH, I TAKE MY PLEASURE IN THEIR FETID BREATH NO LESS THAN IN THEIR VERVE. PITILESS FOR THOSE WHO SUCCEED, THEIR GENIUS FOR DOING NOTHING COMPELS ADMIRATION, THOUGH THE SPECTACLE THEY AFFORD IS THE SADDEST IN THE WORLD: POETS WITHOUT TALENT, WHORES WITHOUT CLIENTS, BUSINESSMEN WITHOUT A PENNY, LOVERS WITHOUT GLANDS, INFERNO OF WOMEN NO ONE WANTS. . . . BEHOLD THEN, I TELL MYSELF, MAN’S NEGATIVE FULFILLMENT, BEHOLD, LAID BARE, THIS BEING WHO PRETENDS TO A DIVINE LINEAGE, PATHETIC COUNTERFEITER OF THE ABSOLUTE. . . . HERE IS WHERE HE WAS TO END, IN THIS SPITTING IMAGE OF HIMSELF, MUD GOD NEVER LAID A HAND ON, BEAST NO ANGEL HAS A PART IN, INFINITY BEGOTTEN IN MOANS, SOUL RISEN OUT OF A SPASM. .. . I CONTEMPLATE THAT DIM DESPAIR OF SPERMATOZOA THAT HAVE REACHED THEIR END, THESE FUNERAL COUNTENANCES OF THE RACE. I AM REASSURED: I HAVE A WAY TO GO STILL. . . . THEN I AM FRIGHTENED: SHALL I TOO FALL SO LOW? AND I HATE THAT TOOTHLESS CRONE, THIS RHYMER WITHOUT VERSES, THESE IMPOTENTS OF LOVE AND AFFAIRS, THESE MODELS OF THE DISHONOR OF THE MIND AND THE FLESH. . . . THE MAN’S EYES OVERWHELM ME; I WANTED TO REAP, ON CONTACT WITH THESE WRECKS, A HARVEST OF PRIDE; I TAKE AWAY A SHUDDER LIKE THE ONE A LIVING MAN WOULD EXPERIENCE WHO, TO DELIGHT IN NOT BEING DEAD, PILFERED A COFFIN. . . .

ON AN ENTREPRENEUR OF IDEAS
HE TRIES EVERYTHING, AND FOR HIM EVERYTHING SUCCEEDS; NOTHING OF WHICH HE IS NOT THE CONTEMPORARY. SO MUCH VIGOR IN THE ARTIFICES OF THE INTELLECT, SO MUCH READINESS TO CONFRONT ALL THE REALMS OF THE MIND AND OF FASHION-—FROM METAPHYSICS TO MOVIES—DAZZLES, MUST DAZZLE. NO PROBLEM RESISTS HIM, NO PHENOMENON IS FOREIGN TO HIM, NO TEMPTATION LEAVES HIM INDIFFERENT. HE IS A CONQUEROR, AND HAS BUT ONE SECRET: HIS LACK OF EMOTION; NOTHING KEEPS HIM FROM DEALING WITH ANYTHING, SINCE HE DOES SO WITH NO ACCENT OF HIS OWN. HIS CONSTRUCTIONS ARE MAGNIFICENT, BUT WITHOUT SALT: CATEGORIES SWELL WITH INTIMATE EXPERIENCES, CLASSIFIED AS IN A FILE OF DISASTERS OR A CATALOGUE OF ANXIETIES. HERE ARE RANGED THE TRIBULATIONS OF MAN, AS WELL AS THE POETRY OF HIS LACERATION. THE IRREMEDIABLE HAS TURNED INTO A SYSTEM, EVEN A SIDE SHOW, DISPLAYED LIKE AN ARTICLE OF COMMON COMMERCE, A TRUE MASS PRODUCT OF ANGUISH. THE PUBLIC DELIGHTS IN IT; THE NIHILISM OF THE BOULEVARD AND THE BITTERNESS OF THE CAFÉ FEED ON IT.

THINKER WITHOUT FATE, INFINITELY EMPTY AND MARVELOUSLY AMPLE, HE EXPLOITS HIS THOUGHT, WANTS IT TO BE ON EVERY MOUTH. NO DESTINY PURSUES HIM: BORN IN THE AGE OF MATERIALISM, HE WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED ITS FACILITY AND GIVEN IT AN UNIMAGINABLE EXTENSION; OUT OF ROMANTICISM HE WOULD HAVE CONSTITUTED A SUMMA OF REVERIES; APPEARING IN THE WORLD OF THEOLOGY, HE WOULD HAVE WIELDED GOD LIKE ANY OTHER CONCEPT. HIS SKILL IN CONFRONTING THE GREAT PROBLEMS IS DISCONCERTING: EVERYTHING IS REMARKABLE, EXCEPT AUTHENTICITY. BASICALLY NON-POET, IF HE SPEAKS OF NOTHINGNESS, HE LACKS ITS SHUDDER; HIS DISGUSTS ARE PONDERED; HIS EXASPERATIONS CONTROLLED AND INVENTED AFTER THE FACT; BUT HIS WILL, SUPERNATURALLY EFFECTIVE, IS AT THE SAME TIME SO LUCID, THAT HE COULD BE A POET IF HE WANTED TO, AND I SHOULD ADD, A SAINT, IF HE INSISTED. . . . HAVING NEITHER PREFERENCES NOR OPPOSITIONS, HIS OPINIONS ARE ACCIDENTS; ONE REGRETS THAT HE BELIEVES IN THEM; ONLY THE MOVEMENT, THE METHOD, OF HIS THOUGHT IS OF INTEREST. WERE I TO HEAR MM PREACH FROM THE PULPIT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED, SO TRUE IS IT THAT HE LOCATES HIMSELF BEYOND ALL TRUTHS, MASTERS THEM, SO THAT NONE IS NECESSARY OR ORGANIC TO HIM. . . .

ADVANCING LIKE AN EXPLORER, HE CONQUERS REALM AFTER REALM; HIS STEPS NO LESS THAN HIS THOUGHTS ARE ENTERPRISES; HIS BRAIN IS NOT THE ENEMY OF HIS INSTINCTS; HE RISES ABOVE THE REST, HAVING SUFFERED NEITHER FATIGUE NOR THAT VEHEMENT MORTIFICATION WHICH PARALYZES DESIRE. SON OF A PERIOD, HE EXPRESSES ITS CONTRADICTIONS, ITS FUTILE DILATION; AND WHEN HE FLUNG HIMSELF FORWARD IN ITS CONQUEST, HE EMPLOYED SO MUCH PERTINACITY AND STUBBORNNESS THAT HIS SUCCESS AND HIS RENOWN EQUAL THOSE OF THE SWORD AND REHABILITATE THE MIND BY MEANS WHICH, HITHERTO, WERE HATEFUL OR UNKNOWN TO IT.

TRUTHS OF TEMPERAMENT
CONFRONTING THINKERS WITHOUT PATHOS, CHARACTER, AND INTENSITY, WHO MODEL THEMSELVES ON THE FORMS OF THEIR TIME, APPEAR OTHERS OF WHOM WE FEEL THAT APPEARING WHENEVER, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME, THEMSELVES, UNCONCERNED BY THEIR AGE, DRAWING THEIR THOUGHTS FROM THEIR OWN DEPTHS, FROM THE SPECIFIC ETERNITY OF THEIR FLAWS. THEY TAKE FROM THEIR ENVIRONMENT ONLY THE SURFACE, A FEW PECULIARITIES OF STYLE, A FEW CHARACTERISTIC TURNS OF A GIVEN DEVELOPMENT. IN LOVE WITH THEIR FATE, THEY SUGGEST EXPLOSIONS, TRAGIC AND SOLITARY FIGURATIONS, SOMETHING BETWEEN APOCALYPSE AND PSYCHIATRY. A KIERKEGAARD, A NIETZSCHE, HAD THEY APPEARED IN THE MOST ANODYNE AGE, WOULD HAVE HAD NO LESS TREMULOUS, NO LESS INCENDIARY AN INSPIRATION. THEY PERISHED IN THEIR FLAMES; A FEW CENTURIES EARLIER, THEY WOULD HAVE PERISHED IN THOSE OF THE STAKE: VIS-A-VIS GENERAL TRUTHS, THEY WERE PREDESTINED TO HERESY IT MATTERS LITTLE THAT ONE BE ENGULFED IN ONE’S OWN FIRE OR IN THAT KINDLED FOR YOU: THE TRUTHS OF TEMPERAMENT MUST BE PAID FOR IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THE VISCERA, THE BLOOD, THE MISERIES, AND THE VICES CONVERGE TO BEGET THEM. IMPREGNATED WITH SUBJECTIVITY, WE PERCEIVE A SELF BEHIND EACH OF THEM: EVERYTHING BECOMES CONFESSION: A SHRIEK OF THE FLESH IS AT THE SOURCE OF THE MOST BANAL UTTERANCE; EVEN A THEORY OF IMPERSONAL APPEARANCE SERVES ONLY TO BETRAY ITS AUTHOR, HIS SECRETS, HIS SUFFERINGS: NO UNIVERSALITY WHICH IS NOT HIS MASK: EVEN LOGIC, EVERYTHING IS AN EXCUSE FOR HIS AUTOBIOGRAPHY; HIS “SELF” HAS INFESTED IDEAS, HIS ANGUISH HAS BEEN CONVERTED INTO A CRITERION, INTO THE SOLE REALITY.

FLAYED ALIVE
WHAT LIFE IS LEFT HIM ROBS HIM OF WHAT REASON IS LEFT HIM. TRIFLES OR SCOURGES—THE PASSING OF A FLY OR THE CRAMPS OF THE PLANET—HORRIFY HIM EQUALLY. WITH HIS NERVES ON FIRE, HE WOULD LIKE THE EARTH TO BE MADE OF GLASS, TO SHATTER IT TO SMITHEREENS; AND WITH WHAT THIRST HE WOULD FLING HIMSELF TOWARD THE STARS TO REDUCE THEM TO POWDER, ONE BY ONE. . . . CRIME GLISTENS IN HIS EYEBALLS; HIS HANDS TIGHTEN IN VAIN TO STRANGLE. LIFE IS TRANSMITTED LIKE A LEPROSY: TOO MANY CREATURES FOR A SINGLE MURDERER. IT IS IN THE NATURE OF THE MAN WHO CANNOT KILL HIMSELF TO SEEK REVENGE AGAINST WHATEVER ENJOYS EXISTING. AND FAILING, HE MOPES LIKE A DAMNED SOUL INFURIATED BY IMPOSSIBLE DESTRUCTIONS. A DISCARDED SATAN, HE WEEPS, POUNDS HIS BREAST, BOWS HIS HEAD; THE BLOOD HE WANTED TO SHED FAILS TO REDDEN HIS OWN CHEEKS WHOSE PALLOR REFLECTS HIS DISGUST WITH THAT SECRETION OF HOPES PRODUCED BY THE ADVANCING SPECIES. HIS GREAT DREAM WAS TO DESTROY THE DAYS OF CREATION .. . HE RENOUNCES HIS DREAM, COLLAPSES INTO HIMSELF, AND YIELDS TO THE ELEGY OF HIS OWN FAILURE: ANOTHER ORDER OF EXCESS IS THE RESULT. HIS SKIN BURNS: FEVER FILLS THE UNIVERSE; HIS BRAIN IS ON FIRE: THE AIR IS INFLAMMABLE. HIS ILLS FILL SIDEREAL SPACE; HIS GRIEFS MAKE THE POLES TREMBLE. AND WHATEVER IS ALLUSION TO EXISTENCE, THE MOST IMPERCEPTIBLE BREATH OF LIFE, WRINGS FROM HIM A CRY WHICH COMPROMISES THE MUSIC OF THE SPHERES AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE STARS.

INCOMPATIBILITIES
A MIND COMPELS US ONLY BY ITS INCOMPATIBILITIES, BY THE TENSION OF ITS MOVEMENTS, BY THE DIVORCE OF ITS OPINIONS FROM ITS INCLINATIONS. MARCUS AURELIUS, ENGAGED ON REMOTE EXPEDITIONS, TENDS MORE TOWARD THE IDEA OF DEATH THAN TOWARD THAT OF THE EMPIRE; JULIAN, MADE EMPEROR, REGRETS HIS CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE, ENVIES THE SAGES, AND WASTES HIS NIGHTS POLEMICIZING AGAINST THE CHRISTIANS; LUTHER, WITH A VANDAL’S VITALITY, SINKS AND MOPES IN THE OBSESSION OF SIN, AND WITHOUT FINDING AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN HIS DELICACIES AND HIS CRUDITIES; ROUSSEAU, WHO MISTAKES HIS INSTINCTS, LIVES ONLY IN THE IDEA OF HIS SINCERITY; NIETZSCHE, WHOSE ENTIRE OEUVRE IS NOTHING BUT A HYMN TO POWER, DRAGS OUT A SICKLY EXISTENCE OF A POIGNANT MONOTONY. . . .

FOR A MIND MATTERS ONLY TO THE DEGREE THAT IT DECEIVES ITSELF AS TO WHAT IT WANTS, WHAT IT LOVES, OR WHAT IT HATES; BEING SEVERAL, IT CANNOT CHOOSE ITSELF. A PESSIMISM WITHOUT RAPTURES, AN AGITATOR OF HOPES WITHOUT BITTERNESS, DESERVES ONLY SCORN. ONLY THE MAN WHO HAS NO REGARD FOR HIS PAST, FOR PROPRIETY, LOGIC, OR CONSIDERATION IS WORTHY OF OUR ATTACHMENT: HOW CAN WE LOVE A CONQUEROR IF HE FAILS TO PLUNGE INTO EVENTS WITH A SUSPICION OF FAILURE, OR A THINKER IF HE HAS NOT CONQUERED HIS INSTINCT FOR SELF-PRESERVATION? MAN FALLEN BACK ON HIS FUTILITY IS NO LONGER CONCERNED WITH THE DESIRE TO HAVE A LIFE. .. . IF HE WERE TO HAVE ONE, OR WERE NOT—WOULD CONCERN THE OTHERS. . . . APOSTLE OF HIS FLUCTUATIONS, HE NO LONGER ENCUMBERS HIMSELF WITH AN IDEAL IDENTITY; HIS TEMPERAMENT CONSTITUTES HIS SOLE DOCTRINE, AND THE WHIM OF THE MOMENT HIS SOLE KNOWLEDGE.

RESTORATION OF A CULT
HAVING ERODED MY QUALITY AS A MAN, NOTHING IS ANY LONGER OF ANY VALUE. EVERYWHERE ALL I SEE ARE ANIMALS WITH AN IDEAL THAT HERD TOGETHER TO BLEAT THEIR HOPES. . . . EVEN THOSE WHO DID NOT LIVE TOGETHER ARE CONSTRAINED TO DO SO LIKE GHOSTS, OR ELSE TO WHAT END HAVE WE CONCEIVED THE “COMMUNION” OF SAINTS? IN PURSUIT OF A TRUE SOLITARY, I SCRUTINIZE THE AGES, AND I FIND THERE, AND ENVY THERE, ONLY THE DEVIL. . . . REASON BANISHES HIM, THE HEART CRAVES HIM. . . . SPIRIT OF LIES, PRINCE OF DARKNESS, THE EVIL ONE, THE ENEMY—HOW SWEET IT IS TO MURMUR THE NAMES THAT FLAYED HIS SOLITUDE! AND HOW I CHERISH HIM SINCE HIS DAILY RELEGATION! IF ONLY I COULD RE-ESTABLISH HIM IN HIS PRIMAL STATE! I BELIEVE IN HIM WITH ALL MY INCAPACITY TO BELIEVE. HIS COMPANY IS NECESSARY TO ME: A LONELY BEING TENDS TOWARD THE LONELIEST BEING—TOWARD THE ONE. . . . I OWE IT TO MYSELF TO TEND TOWARD HIM: MY POWER TO ADMIRE—FEARING TO REMAIN UNEMPLOYED—COMPELS ME TO IT. BEHOLD ME CONFRONTING MY MODEL; ATTACHING MYSELF TO HIM, I PUNISH MY SOLITUDE FOR NOT BEING TOTAL, I FORGE OUT OF IT ANOTHER WHICH TRANSCENDS IT: IT IS MY WAY OF BEING HUMBLE. . . .

WE REPLACE GOD AS BEST WE CAN; FOR EVERY GOD IS GOOD, PROVIDED HE PERPETUATES IN ETERNITY OUR DESIRE FOR A CRUCIAL SOLITUDE. . . .

WE TROGLODYTES
VALUES DO NOT ACCUMULATE: A GENERATION CONTRIBUTES SOMETHING NEW ONLY BY TRAMPLING ON WHAT WAS UNIQUE IN THE PRECEDING GENERATION. THIS IS EVEN MORE THE CASE IN THE SUCCESSION OF CENTURIES: THE RENAISSANCE COULD NOT “SAVE” THE DEPTH, THE PHANTOMS, THE GENRE OF SAVAGERY OF THE MIDDLE AGES; THE ENLIGHTENMENT IN ITS TURN PRESERVED ONLY THE SENSE OF THE UNIVERSAL FROM THE RENAISSANCE, WITHOUT THE PATHOS WHICH MARKED ITS PHYSIOGNOMY. THE MODERN ILLUSION HAS PLUNGED MAN INTO THE SWOONS OF BECOMING: HE HAS LOST HIS FOOTING IN ETERNITY, HIS “SUBSTANCE.” EVERY CONQUEST, SPIRITUAL OR POLITICAL, IMPLIES A LOSS; EVERY CONQUEST IS AN AFFIRMATION . . . BUT A MURDEROUS ONE. IN THE REALM OF ART—THE ONLY ONE IN WHICH WE CAN SPEAK OF THE LIFE OF THE MIND—AN “IDEAL” IS ESTABLISHED ONLY ON THE RUINS OF ITS PREDECESSOR: EACH TRUE ARTIST IS A TRAITOR TO HIS FOREBEARS. . . . THERE IS NO SUPERIORITY IN HISTORY: REPUBLIC-MONARCHY; ROMANTICISM-CLASSICISM; LIBERALISM-AUTOCRACY; NATURALISM-ABSTRACTION; IRRATIONALISM-INTELLECTUALISM—INSTITUTIONS, LIKE CURRENTS OF THOUGHT AND FEELING, ARE OF EQUAL WORTH. NO FORM OF MIND CAN ASSUME ANOTHER; WE ARE SOMETHING ONLY BY EXCLUSION: NO ONE CAN RECONCILE ORDER AND DISORDER, ABSTRACTION AND IMMEDIACY, IMPULSE AND FATALITY. THE PERIODS OF SYNTHESIS ARE NOT CREATIVE: THEY SUMMARIZE THE FERVOR OF THE OTHERS, A CONFUSED, CHAOTIC RÉSUMÉ—EVERY ECLECTICISM BEING AN INDICATION OF AN ENDING.

EVERY STEP FORWARD IS FOLLOWED BY A STEP BACK: THIS IS THE UNFRUITFUL OSCILLATION OF HISTORY—A STATIONARY . . . BECOMING. THAT MAN SHOULD HAVE LET HIMSELF BE DUPED BY THE MIRAGE OF PROGRESS IS WHAT RENDERS HIS CLAIMS TO SUBTLETY ABSURD. PROGRESS? PERHAPS WE CAN FIND IT IN HYGIENE. . . . BUT ANYWHERE ELSE? IN SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES? AFTER ALL, NO MORE THAN DEADLY GLORIES. . . . WHO, IN GOOD FAITH, COULD CHOOSE BETWEEN THE STONE AGE AND THE AGE OF MODERN WEAPONS? AS CLOSE TO THE APE IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER, WE SCALE THE CLOUDS FOR THE SAME REASONS WE SHINNIED UP TREES: THE MEANS OF OUR CURIOSITY PURE OR CRIMINAL ARE ALL THAT HAVE CHANGED, AND—WITH DISGUISED REFLEXES—WE ARE MORE DIVERSELY RAPACIOUS. A MERE WHIM TO ACCEPT OR REJECT A PERIOD: WE MUST ACCEPT OR REJECT HISTORY EN BLOC. THE NOTION OF PROGRESS MAKES US ALL DOLTS ON THE PINNACLES OF TIME; BUT THESE PINNACLES DO NOT EXIST: THE TROGLODYTE WHO TREMBLED WITH FEAR IN THE CAVES STILL TREMBLES IN THE SKYSCRAPERS. OUR CAPITAL OF MISERY REMAINS INTACT DOWN THROUGH THE AGES; YET WE HAVE ONE ADVANTAGE OVER OUR ANCESTORS: THAT OF HAVING INVESTED OUR CAPITAL BETTER, SINCE OUR DISASTER IS BETTER ORGANIZED.

PHYSIOGNOMY OF A FAILURE
MONSTROUS DREAMS INHABIT GROCERIES AND CHURCHES: I HAVE COME ACROSS NO ONE WHO DID NOT LIVE IN DELIRIUM. SINCE THE MEREST DESIRE CONCEALS A SOURCE OF INSANITY, IT IS ENOUGH TO CONFORM TO THE INSTINCT OF SELF-PRESERVATION TO DESERVE THE ASYLUM. LIFE—A FIT OF LUNACY THROTTLING MATTER. .. . I BREATHE: ENOUGH TO BE PUT AWAY. . . . INCAPABLE OF ATTAINING TO THE LUCIDITIES OF DEATH, I CRAWL IN THE SHADOW OF THE DAYS, AND I YET AM ONLY BY THE WILL NO LONGER TO BE. . . .

ONCE I THOUGHT I COULD CRUSH SPACE WITH A BLOW OF MY FIST, PLAY WITH THE STARS, HALT TIME OR WIELD IT ACCORDING TO MY WHIM. THE GREAT CAPTAINS SEEMED TO ME THE GREAT COWARDS, THE POETS, WRETCHED STAMMERERS; NOT KNOWING THE RESISTANCE THINGS, MEN, AND WORDS OFFER US, AND SUPPOSING I FELT MORE THAN THE UNIVERSE ALLOWED, I GAVE MYSELF UP TO A SUSPECT INFINITY, TO A COSMOGONY RESULTING FROM A PUBERTY UNFIT TO END ITSELF. . . . HOW EASY IT IS TO BELIEVE YOURSELF A GOD BY THE HEART, AND HOW HARD IT IS TO BE ONE BY THE MIND! AND WITH HOW MANY ILLUSIONS MUST I HAVE BEEN BORN IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO LOSE ONE EVERY DAY! LIFE IS A MIRACLE BITTERNESS DESTROYS.

THE INTERVAL SEPARATING ME FROM MY CORPSE IS A WOUND; YET I ASPIRE IN VAIN TO THE SEDUCTIONS OF THE GRAVE: UNABLE TO RID MYSELF OF ANYTHING, TO CEASE BREATHING EITHER, EVERYTHING IN ME SUGGESTS THAT THE WORMS WILL BE OUT OF WORK WHEN THEY GET TO MY INSTINCTS AS INCOMPETENT IN LIFE AS IN DEATH, I LOATHE MYSELF AND IN THIS LOATHING I DREAM OF ANOTHER LIFE, ANOTHER DEATH. AND FOR HAVING SOUGHT TO BE A SAGE SUCH AS NEVER WAS, I AM ONLY A MADMAN AMONG THE MAD. . . .

PROCESSION OF SUB-MEN
COMMITTED BEYOND HIS MEANS, BEYOND HIS INSTINCTS, MAN HAS ENDED UP IN AN IMPASSE. HE HAS BURNED HIS BRIDGES . . . TO CATCH UP WITH HIS CONCLUSION; ANIMAL WITHOUT A FUTURE, HE HAS FOUNDERED IN HIS IDEAL, HE HAS WORSTED HIMSELF AT HIS OWN GAME. HAVING CEASELESSLY SOUGHT TO TRANSCEND HIMSELF, HE IS PARALYZED; AND HIS ONLY REMAINING RESOURCE IS TO RECAPITULATE HIS FOLLIES, TO EXPIATE THEM, AND TO COMMIT A FEW MORE. . . .

YET THERE ARE SOME TO WHOM EVEN THIS RESOURCE REMAINS FORBIDDEN: “UNACCUSTOMED TO BEING MEN,” THEY MURMUR, “DO WE STILL BELONG TO A TRIBE, A RACE, A BREED? SO LONG AS WE HAD THE PREJUDICE OF LIFE, WE ESPOUSED AN ERROR WHICH KEPT US ON A FOOTING WITH THE OTHERS. . . . BUT WE HAVE ESCAPED THE RACE. . . . OUR LUCIDITY, CRUMBLING OUR SKELETON, HAS REDUCED US TO A LIMP EXISTENCE—INVERTEBRATE RABBLE STRETCHING OUT ON MATTER TO CORRUPT IT WITH SLOBBER. BEHOLD US AMONG THE SLIME, BEHOLD US AT THAT LAUGHABLE END WHERE WE PAY FOR HAVING MISUSED OUR FACULTIES AND OUR DREAMS. . . . LIFE WAS NOT OUR LOT: AT THE VERY MOMENTS WHEN WE WERE DRUNK WITH LIFE, ALL OUR JOYS CAME FROM OUR TRANSPORTS ABOVE IT; TAKING REVENGE, LIFE LUGS US TOWARD ITS LOWER DEPTHS: PROCESSION OF SUB-MEN TOWARD A SUB-LIFE. . . ”

QUOUSQUE EADEM?
FOREVER BE ACCURSED THE STAR UNDER WHICH I WAS BORN, MAY NO SKY PROTECT IT, LET IT CRUMBLE IN SPACE LIKE A DUST WITHOUT HONOR! AND LET THE TRAITOROUS MOMENT THAT CAST ME AMONG THE CREATURES BE FOREVER ERASED FROM THE LISTS OF TIME! MY DESIRES CAN NO LONGER DEAL WITH THIS MIXTURE OF LIFE AND DEATH IN WHICH ETERNITY DAILY ROTS. WEARY OF THE FUTURE, I HAVE TRAVERSED ITS DAYS, AND YET I AM TORMENTED BY THE INTEMPERANCE OF UNKNOWN THIRSTS. LIKE A FRENZIED SAGE, DEAD TO THE WORLD AND FRANTIC AGAINST IT, I INVALIDATE MY ILLUSIONS ONLY TO IRRITATE THEM THE MORE. THIS EXASPERATION IN AN UNFORESEEABLE UNIVERSE— WHERE NONETHELESS EVERYTHING REPEATS ITSELF—WILL IT NEVER COME TO AN END? HOW LONG MUST I KEEP TELLING MYSELF: “I LOATHE THIS LIFE I IDOLIZE?” THE NULLITY OF OUR DELIRIUMS MAKES US ALL SO MANY GODS SUBJECT TO AN INSIPID FATALITY. WHY REBEL ANY LONGER AGAINST THE SYMMETRY OF THIS WORLD WHEN CHAOS ITSELF CAN ONLY BE A SYSTEM OF DISORDERS? OUR FATE BEING TO ROT WITH THE CONTINENTS AND THE STARS, WE DRAG ON, LIKE RESIGNED SICK MEN, AND TO THE END OF TIME, THE CURIOSITY OF A DENOUEMENT THAT IS FORESEEN, FRIGHTFUL, AND VAIN.

I FELT THE GODS WERE LACKING AS LONG AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO OPPOSE THEM.

—LUCIAN, PROMETHEUS IN THE CAUCASUS

WHAT DOES PROMETHEUS MEAN TO MAN TODAY? ONE COULD DOUBTLESS CLAIM THIS GOD-DEFYING REBEL AS THE MODEL OF CONTEMPORARY MAN AND HIS PROTEST THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO IN THE DESERTS OF SCYTHIA AS CULMINATING IN THE UNPARALLELED HISTORICAL CONVULSION OF OUR DAY. BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, SOMETHING SUGGESTS THAT THIS VICTIM OF PERSECUTION IS STILL AMONG US AND THAT WE ARE STILL DEAF TO THE GREAT CRY OF HUMAN REVOLT OF WHICH HE GIVES THE SOLITARY SIGNAL.

MODERN MAN INDEED ENDURES A MULTITUDE OF SUFFERING ON THE NARROW SURFACE OF THIS EARTH; FOR THE MAN DEPRIVED OF FOOD AND WARMTH, LIBERTY IS MERELY A LUXURY THAT CAN WAIT; ALL HE CAN DO IS SUFFER A LITTLE MORE, AS IF IT WERE ONLY A QUESTION OF LETTING LIBERTY AND ITS LAST WITNESSES VANISH A BIT MORE. PROMETHEUS WAS THE HERO WHO LOVED MEN ENOUGH TO GIVE THEM FIRE AND LIBERTY, TECHNOLOGY AND ART. TODAY, MANKIND NEEDS AND CARES ONLY FOR TECHNOLOGY. WE REBEL THROUGH OUR MACHINES, HOLDING ART AND WHAT ART IMPLIES AS AN OBSTACLE AND A SYMBOL OF SLAVERY. BUT WHAT CHARACTERIZES PROMETHEUS IS THAT HE CANNOT SEPARATE MACHINES FROM ART. HE BELIEVES THAT BOTH SOULS AND BODIES CAN BE FREED AT THE SAME TIME. MAN TODAY BELIEVES THAT WE MUST FIRST OF ALL FREE THE BODY, EVEN IF THE MIND MUST SUFFER TEMPORARY DEATH. BUT CAN THE MIND DIE TEMPORARILY? INDEED, IF PROMETHEUS WERE TO REAPPEAR, MODERN MAN WOULD TREAT HIM AS THE GODS DID LONG AGO: THEY WOULD NAIL HIM TO A ROCK, IN THE NAME OF THE VERY HUMANISM HE WAS THE FIRST TO SYMBOLIZE. THE HOSTILE VOICES TO INSULT THE DEFEATED VICTIM WOULD BE THE VERY ONES THAT ECHO ON THE THRESHOLD OF AESCHYLEAN TRAGEDY: THOSE OF FORCE AND VIOLENCE.

AM I YIELDING TO THE MEANNESS OF OUR TIMES, TO NAKED TREES AND THE WINTER OF THE WORLD? BUT THIS VERY NOSTALGIA FOR LIGHT IS MY JUSTIFICATION: IT SPEAKS TO ME OF ANOTHER WORLD, OF MY TRUE HOMELAND. DOES THIS NOSTALGIA STILL MEAN SOMETHING TO SOME MEN? THE YEAR THE WAR BEGAN, I WAS TO BOARD A SHIP AND FOLLOW THE VOYAGE OF ULYSSES. AT THAT TIME, EVEN A YOUNG MAN WITHOUT MONEY COULD ENTERTAIN THE EXTRAVAGANT NOTION OF CROSSING THE SEA IN QUEST OF SUNLIGHT. BUT I DID WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DID AT THE TIME. I DID NOT GET ON THAT SHIP. I TOOK MY PLACE IN THE QUEUE SHUFFLING TOWARD THE OPEN MOUTH OF HELL. LITTLE BY LITTLE, WE ENTERED. AT THE FIRST CRY OF MURDERED INNOCENCE, THE DOOR SLAMMED SHUT BEHIND US. WE WERE IN HELL, AND WE HAVE NOT LEFT IT SINCE. FOR SIX LONG YEARS WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COME TO TERMS WITH IT. NOW WE GLIMPSE THE WARM GHOSTS OF FORTUNATE ISLANDS ONLY AT THE END OF LONG, COLD, SUNLESS YEARS THAT LIE AHEAD.

HOW THEN, IN THIS DAMP, DARK EUROPE, CAN WE AVOID HEARING WITH A QUIVER OF REGRET AND DIFFICULT COMPLICITY THE CRY THE AGED CHATEAUBRIAND UTTERED TO AMPÈRE DEPARTING FOR GREECE: “YOU WON’T FIND A LEAF FROM THE OLIVE TREES OR A SINGLE GRAPE LEFT OF THE ONES I SAW IN ATTICA. I EVEN MISS THE GRASS THAT GREW THERE IN MY DAY. I HAVEN’T HAD THE STRENGTH TO MAKE A PATCH OF HEATHER GROW.” AND WE TOO, FOR ALL OUR YOUTHFUL BLOOD, SUNK AS WE ARE IN THE TERRIBLE OLD AGE OF THIS LAST CENTURY, SOMETIMES MISS THE GRASS THAT HAS ALWAYS GROWN, THE OLIVE LEAF THAT WE’LL NO LONGER GO TO LOOK AT JUST TO SEE IT, AND THE GRAPES OF LIBERTY. MAN IS EVERYWHERE, AND EVERYWHERE WE FIND HIS CRIES, HIS SUFFERING, AND HIS THREATS. WITH SO MANY MEN GATHERED TOGETHER, THERE IS NO ROOM FOR GRASSHOPPERS. HISTORY IS A STERILE EARTH WHERE HEATHER DOES NOT GROW. YET MEN TODAY HAVE CHOSEN HISTORY, AND THEY NEITHER COULD NOR SHOULD TURN AWAY FROM IT. BUT INSTEAD OF MASTERING IT, THEY AGREE A LITTLE MORE EACH DAY TO BE ITS SLAVE. THUS THEY BETRAY PROMETHEUS, THIS SON “BOTH BOLD IN THOUGHT AND LIGHT OF HEART.” THIS IS HOW THEY REVERT TO THE WRETCHEDNESS OF THE MEN PROMETHEUS TRIED TO SAVE. “THEY SAW WITHOUT SEEING, HEARD WITHOUT LISTENING, LIKE FIGURES IN A DREAM.”

YES, ONE EVENING IN PROVENCE, ONE PERFECT HILL, ONE WHIFF OF SALT ARE ENOUGH TO SHOW US THAT EVERYTHING STILL LIES BEFORE US. WE NEED TO INVENT FIRE ONCE MORE, TO SETTLE DOWN ONCE AGAIN TO THE JOB OF APPEASING THE BODY’S HUNGER. ATTICA, LIBERTY, AND ITS GRAPE-GATHERING, THE BREAD OF THE SOUL, MUST COME LATER. WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT THIS BUT CRY TO OURSELVES: “THEY WILL NEVER EXIST ANY MORE, OR THEY WILL EXIST FOR OTHERS,” AND DO WHAT MUST BE DONE SO THAT OTHERS AT LEAST DO NOT GO BEGGING? WE WHO FEEL THIS SO PAINFULLY, AND YET WHO TRY TO ACCEPT IT WITHOUT BITTERNESS, ARE WE LAGGING BEHIND, OR ARE WE FORGING AHEAD, AND WILL WE HAVE THE STRENGTH TO MAKE THE HEATHER GROW AGAIN?

WE CAN IMAGINE HOW PROMETHEUS WOULD HAVE REPLIED TO THIS QUESTION THAT RISES FROM OUR CENTURY. INDEED, HE HAS ALREADY GIVEN HIS ANSWER: “I PROMISE YOU, O MORTALS, BOTH IMPROVEMENT AND REPAIR, IF YOU ARE SKILLFUL, VIRTUOUS AND STRONG ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE THEM WITH YOUR OWN HANDS.” IF, THEN, IT IS TRUE THAT SALVATION LIES IN OUR OWN HANDS, I WILL ANSWER YES TO THE QUESTION OF THE CENTURY, BECAUSE OF THE THOUGHTFUL STRENGTH AND THE INTELLIGENT COURAGE I STILL FEEL IN SOME OF THE PEOPLE I KNOW. “O JUSTICE, O MY MOTHER,” CRIES PROMETHEUS, “YOU SEE WHAT I AM MADE TO SUFFER.” AND HERMES MOCKS THE HERO: “I AM AMAZED THAT, BEING A GOD, YOU DID NOT FORESEE THE TORMENT YOU ARE SUFFERING.” “I DID SEE IT,” REPLIES THE REBEL. THE MEN I’VE MENTIONED ARE ALSO THE SONS OF JUSTICE. THEY, TOO, SUFFER FROM THE MISERY OF ALL MEN, KNOWING WHAT THEY DO. THEY KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT BLIND JUSTICE DOES NOT EXIST, THAT HISTORY HAS NO EYES, AND THAT WE MUST THEREFORE REJECT ITS JUSTICE IN ORDER TO REPLACE IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE JUSTICE CONCEIVED BY THE MIND. THIS IS HOW PROMETHEUS RETURNS IN OUR CENTURY.

MYTHS HAVE NO LIFE OF THEIR OWN. THEY WAIT FOR US TO GIVE THEM FLESH. IF ONE MAN IN THE WORLD ANSWERS THEIR CALL, THEY GIVE US THEIR STRENGTH IN ALL ITS FULLNESS. WE MUST PRESERVE THIS MYTH, AND ENSURE THAT ITS SLUMBER IS NOT MORTAL SO THAT ITS RESURRECTION IS POSSIBLE. I SOMETIMES DOUBT WHETHER MEN CAN BE SAVED TODAY. BUT IT IS STILL POSSIBLE TO SAVE THEIR CHILDREN, BOTH BODY AND MIND. IT IS POSSIBLE TO OFFER THEM AT THE SAME TIME THE CHANCE FOR HAPPINESS AND BEAUTY. IF WE MUST RESIGN OURSELVES TO LIVING WITHOUT BEAUTY, AND THE FREEDOM THAT IS A PART OF BEAUTY, THE MYTH OF PROMETHEUS IS ONE OF THOSE THAT WILL REMIND US THAT ANY MUTILATION OF MAN CAN ONLY BE TEMPORARY, AND THAT ONE SERVES NOTHING IN MAN IF ONE DOES NOT SERVE THE WHOLE MAN. IF HE IS HUNGRY FOR BREAD AND HEATHER, AND IF IT IS TRUE THAT BREAD IS THE MORE NECESSARY, LET US LEARN HOW TO KEEP THE MEMORY OF HEATHER ALIVE. AT THE DARKEST HEART OF HISTORY, PROMETHEAN MEN, WITHOUT FLINCHING FROM THEIR DIFFICULT CALLING, WILL KEEP WATCH OVER THE EARTH AND THE TIRELESS GRASS. IN THE THUNDER AND LIGHTNING OF THE GODS, THE CHAINED HERO KEEPS HIS QUIET FAITH IN MAN. THIS IS HOW HE IS HARDER THAN HIS ROCK AND MORE PATIENT THAN HIS VULTURE. HIS LONG STUBBORNNESS HAS MORE MEANING FOR US THAN HIS REVOLT AGAINST THE GODS. ALONG WITH HIS ADMIRABLE DETERMINATION TO SEPARATE AND EXCLUDE NOTHING, WHICH ALWAYS HAS AND ALWAYS WILL RECONCILE HUMANITY’S SUFFERING WITH THE SPRINGTIMES OF THE WORLD.

1946


WAVES OF SUNLIGHT, POURING FROM THE TOPMOST SKY, BOUNCE FIERCELY ON THE COUNTRYSIDE AROUND US. EVERYTHING GROWS QUIET BENEATH ITS FORCE, AND MOUNT LUBERON, OVER THERE, IS MERELY A VAST BLOCK OF SILENCE THAT I LISTEN TO UNCEASINGLY. I LISTEN CAREFULLY, SOMEONE IS RUNNING TOWARD ME IN THE DISTANCE, INVISIBLE FRIENDS CALL TO ME, MY JOY GROWS, JUST AS YEARS AGO. ONCE AGAIN, A HAPPY ENIGMA HELPS ME TO UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING.

WHERE IS THE ABSURDITY OF THE WORLD? IS IT THIS RESPLENDENT GLOW OR THE MEMORY OF ITS ABSENCE? WITH SO MUCH SUN IN MY MEMORY, HOW COULD I HAVE WAGERED ON NONSENSE? PEOPLE AROUND ME ARE AMAZED; SO AM I, AT TIMES. I COULD TELL THEM, AS I TELL MYSELF, THAT IT WAS IN FACT THE SUN THAT HELPED ME, AND THAT THE VERY THICKNESS OF ITS LIGHT COAGULATES THE UNIVERSE AND ITS FORMS INTO A DAZZLING DARKNESS. BUT THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF SAYING THIS, AND I SHOULD LIKE, FACED WITH THE WHITE AND BLACK CLARITY THAT, FOR ME, HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE SIGN OF TRUTH, TO EXPLAIN IN SIMPLE TERMS WHAT I FEEL ABOUT THIS ABSURDITY WHICH I KNOW TOO WELL TO ALLOW ANYONE TO HOLD FORTH ON IT WITHOUT MAKING CERTAIN NUANCES. THE VERY FACT OF TALKING ABOUT IT, AFTER ALL, WILL LEAD US BACK TO THE SUN.

NO MAN CAN SAY WHAT HE IS. BUT SOMETIMES HE CAN SAY WHAT HE IS NOT. EVERYONE WANTS THE MAN WHO IS STILL SEARCHING TO HAVE ALREADY REACHED HIS CONCLUSIONS. A THOUSAND VOICES ARE ALREADY TELLING HIM WHAT HE HAS FOUND, AND YET HE KNOWS THAT HE HASN’T FOUND ANYTHING. SHOULD HE SEARCH ON AND LET THEM TALK? OF COURSE. BUT, FROM TIME TO TIME, ONE MUST DEFEND HIMSELF. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR, CAUTIOUSLY I GIVE IT A NAME, I WITHDRAW WHAT I SAID, I REPEAT MYSELF, I GO BACKWARD AND FORWARD. YET PEOPLE INSIST I IDENTIFY MY TERM OR TERMS, ONCE AND FOR ALL. THEN I OBJECT; WHEN THINGS HAVE A LABEL AREN’T THEY LOST ALREADY? HERE, AT LEAST, IS WHAT I CAN TRY TO SAY.

IF I AM TO BELIEVE ONE OF MY FRIENDS, A MAN ALWAYS HAS TWO CHARACTERS: HIS OWN, AND THE ONE HIS WIFE THINKS HE HAS. SUBSTITUTE SOCIETY FOR WIFE AND WE SHALL UNDERSTAND HOW A PARTICULAR EXPRESSION, USED BY A WRITER TO DESCRIBE A WHOLE CONTEXT OF EMOTIONS, CAN BE ISOLATED BY THE WAY PEOPLE COMMENT ON IT AND LAID BEFORE ITS AUTHOR EVERY TIME HE TRIES TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. WORDS ARE LIKE ACTIONS: “ARE YOU THE FATHER OF THIS CHILD?” “YES.” “THEN HE IS YOUR SON.” “IT IS NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT, NOT AT ALL!” THUS GERARD DE NERVAL, ONE FILTHY NIGHT, HANGED HIMSELF TWICE, ONCE FOR HIMSELF BECAUSE HE WAS UNHAPPY, AND A SECOND TIME FOR HIS LEGEND, WHICH NOW HELPS SOME PEOPLE TO LIVE. NO ONE CAN WRITE ABOUT REAL UNHAPPINESS, OR ABOUT CERTAIN MOMENTS OF HAPPINESS, AND I SHALL NOT TRY TO DO SO HERE. BUT, AS FAR AS LEGENDS ARE CONCERNED, WE CAN DESCRIBE THEM, AND, FOR A MOMENT AT LEAST, BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE DISPELLED THEM.

A WRITER WRITES TO A GREAT EXTENT TO BE READ (LET’S ADMIRE THOSE WHO SAY THEY DON’T, BUT NOT BELIEVE THEM). YET MORE AND MORE, IN FRANCE, HE WRITES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THAT FINAL CONSECRATION WHICH CONSISTS OF NOT BEING READ. IN FACT, FROM THE MOMENT HE CAN PROVIDE THE MATERIAL FOR A FEATURE ARTICLE IN THE POPULAR PRESS, THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT HE WILL BE KNOWN TO A FAIRLY LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WILL NEVER READ HIS WORKS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE CONTENT TO KNOW HIS NAME AND TO READ WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WRITE ABOUT HIM. FROM THAT POINT ON HE WILL BE KNOWN (AND FORGOTTEN) NOT FOR WHAT HE IS, BUT ACCORDING TO THE IMAGE A HURRIED JOURNALIST HAS GIVEN OF HIM. TO MAKE A NAME IN LITERATURE, THEREFORE, IT IS NO LONGER INDISPENSABLE TO WRITE BOOKS. IT IS ENOUGH TO BE THOUGHT OF AS HAVING WRITTEN ONE WHICH THE EVENING PAPERS WILL HAVE MENTIONED AND WHICH ONE CAN FALL BACK ON FOR THE REST OF ONE’S LIFE.

THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SUCH A REPUTATION, GREAT OR SMALL, WILL BE UNDESERVED. BUT WHAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT? LET US RATHER ADMIT THAT THE INCONVENIENCE MAY ALSO BE BENEFICIAL. DOCTORS KNOW THAT CERTAIN ILLNESSES ARE DESIRABLE: THEY COMPENSATE, IN SOME WAY, FOR A FUNCTIONAL DISORDER WHICH, WITHOUT THEM, MIGHT EXPRESS ITSELF IN SOME MORE SERIOUS DISTURBANCE. THUS THERE ARE FORTUNATE CONSTIPATIONS AND PROVIDENTIAL ATTACKS OF ARTHRITIS. THE FLOOD OF WORDS AND HASTY JUDGMENTS, WHICH NOWADAYS DROWNS ALL PUBLIC ACTIVITY IN AN OCEAN OF FRIVOLITY, AT LEAST ENDOWS THE FRENCH WRITER WITH A MODESTY HE CONSTANTLY NEEDS IN A NATION THAT, FURTHERMORE, GIVES A DISPROPORTIONATE IMPORTANCE TO HIS CALLING. TO SEE ONE’S NAME IN TWO OR THREE NEWSPAPERS I COULD MENTION IS SO HARSH A TRIAL THAT IT MUST INEVITABLY INVOLVE SOME SPIRITUAL BENEFIT. PRAISE BE, THEN, TO A SOCIETY THAT TEACHES US SO CHEAPLY, EVERY DAY, BY ITS VERY HOMAGE, THAT THE GREATNESS IT HONORS IS WORTHLESS. THE LOUDER ITS NOISE, THE QUICKER IT DIES. IT EVOKES THE FLAXEN FIRES ALEXANDER VI OFTEN HAD BURNED BEFORE HIM TO REMIND HIM THAT THE GLORY OF THIS WORLD VANISHES LIKE SMOKE.

BUT LET’S LEAVE IRONY ASIDE. IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY THAT AN ARTIST MUST RESIGN HIMSELF GOOD HUMOREDLY AND ALLOW WHAT HE KNOWS IS AN UNDESERVED IMAGE OF HIMSELF TO LIE ABOUT IN DENTISTS’ WAITING ROOMS AND AT THE HAIRDRESSER’S. I KNOW A FASHIONABLE WRITER WHO, ACCORDING TO SUCH SOURCES, SUPPOSEDLY SPENT EVERY NIGHT PRESIDING OVER BACCHANALIAN ORGIES, WHERE NYMPHS WERE CLOTHED IN NOTHING BUT THEIR HAIR AND FAUNS HAD GLOOMY FINGERNAILS. ONE MIGHT HAVE WONDERED HOW HE FOUND THE TIME TO WRITE A SERIES OF BOOKS THAT FILL SEVERAL LIBRARY SHELVES. LIKE MOST OF HIS COLLEAGUES, THIS WRITER ACTUALLY SPENDS HIS NIGHTS SLEEPING IN ORDER TO SPEND LONG HOURS EVERY DAY AT HIS DESK, AND DRINKS VICHY WATER SO AS NOT TO STRAIN HIS LIVER. THIS DOES NOT PREVENT THE AVERAGE FRENCHMAN, WHOSE SAHARAN SOBRIETY AND MANIA FOR CLEANLINESS ARE WELL KNOWN, FROM GROWING INDIGNANT AT THE IDEA OF OUR WRITERS TEACHING PEOPLE TO DRINK AND NOT TO WASH. THERE IS NO DEARTH OF EXAMPLES. I PERSONALLY CAN FURNISH AN EXCELLENT CHEAP RECIPE FOR SECURING A REPUTATION FOR AUSTERITY. I ACTUALLY HAVE SO WEIGHTY A REPUTATION, A SOURCE OF GREAT AMUSEMENT TO MY FRIENDS (AS FAR AS I’M CONCERNED, IT RATHER MAKES ME BLUSH, SINCE I KNOW HOW LITTLE I DESERVE IT). IT’S ENOUGH, FOR INSTANCE, TO DECLINE THE HONOR OF DINING WITH A NEWSPAPER EDITOR OF WHOM YOU DO NOT HAVE A HIGH OPINION. EVEN SIMPLE DECENCY CANNOT BE IMAGINED EXCEPT BY REFERENCE TO SOME TWISTED SICKNESS OF THE SOUL. NO ONE WILL EVER IMAGINE THAT IF YOU REFUSE THIS EDITOR’S DINNER, IT MAY BE NOT ONLY BECAUSE YOU HAVEN’T A VERY HIGH OPINION OF HIM, BUT ALSO BECAUSE YOUR GREATEST FEAR IN THE WORLD IS BEING BORED—AND WHAT IS MORE BORING THAN A TYPICAL PARISIAN DINNER?

ONE MUST THEREFORE SUBMIT. BUT, FROM TIME TO TIME, YOU CAN TRY TO READJUST THE SIGHTS, AND REPEAT THAT YOU CAN’T ALWAYS BE A PAINTER OF THE ABSURD AND THAT NO ONE CAN BELIEVE IN A LITERATURE OF DESPAIR. OF COURSE, IT IS ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO WRITE, OR TO HAVE WRITTEN, AN ESSAY ON THE NOTION OF THE ABSURD. BUT AFTER ALL, YOU CAN ALSO WRITE ABOUT INCEST WITHOUT NECESSARILY HAVING HURLED YOURSELF ON YOUR UNFORTUNATE SISTER, AND I HAVE NOWHERE READ THAT SOPHOCLES EVER THOUGHT OF KILLING HIS FATHER AND DISHONORING HIS MOTHER. THE IDEA THAT EVERY WRITER NECESSARILY WRITES ABOUT HIMSELF AND DEPICTS HIMSELF IN HIS BOOKS IS ONE OF THE PUERILE NOTIONS THAT WE HAVE INHERITED FROM ROMANTICISM. IT IS BY NO MEANS IMPOSSIBLE—QUITE THE OPPOSITE—THAT A WRITER SHOULD BE INTERESTED FIRST AND FOREMOST IN OTHER PEOPLE, OR IN HIS TIME, OR IN WELL-KNOWN MYTHS. EVEN IF HE DOES HAPPEN TO PUT HIMSELF ON STAGE, IT IS ONLY VERY EXCEPTIONALLY THAT HE TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE IS REALLY LIKE. A MAN’S WORKS OFTEN RETRACE THE STORY OF HIS NOSTALGIAS OR HIS TEMPTATIONS, PRACTICALLY NEVER HIS OWN HISTORY ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY CLAIM TO BE AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL. NO MAN HAS EVER DARED DESCRIBE HIMSELF AS HE IS.

ON THE OTHER HAND, AS FAR AS SUCH A THING IS POSSIBLE, I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE BEEN AN OBJECTIVE WRITER. WHAT I CALL AN OBJECTIVE AUTHOR IS ONE WHO CHOOSES THEMES WITHOUT EVER TAKING HIMSELF AS THE SUBJECT. BUT THE MODERN MANIA OF IDENTIFYING THE AUTHOR WITH HIS SUBJECT MATTER WILL NOT ALLOW HIM THIS RELATIVE CREATIVE LIBERTY. THUS DOES ONE BECOME A PROPHET OF THE ABSURD. YET WHAT ELSE HAVE I DONE EXCEPT REASON ABOUT AN IDEA I DISCOVERED IN THE STREETS OF MY TIME? THAT I HAVE NOURISHED THIS IDEA (AND PART OF ME NOURISHES IT STILL) ALONG WITH MY WHOLE GENERATION GOES WITHOUT SAYING. I SIMPLY SET IT FAR ENOUGH AWAY SO THAT I COULD DEAL WITH IT AND DECIDE ON ITS LOGIC. EVERYTHING THAT I’VE BEEN ABLE TO WRITE SINCE SHOWS THIS PLAINLY ENOUGH. BUT IT IS MORE CONVENIENT TO EXPLOIT A CLICHÉ THAN A NUANCE. THEY’VE CHOSEN THE CLICHÉ: SO I’M AS ABSURD AS EVER.

WHAT IS THE POINT OF SAYING YET AGAIN THAT IN THE EXPERIENCE WHICH INTERESTED ME, AND WHICH I HAPPENED TO WRITE ABOUT, THE ABSURD CAN BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE—EVEN THOUGH THE MEMORY AND FEELING OF IT STILL ACCOMPANY THE FARTHER ADVANCES. IN THE SAME MANNER, WITH ALL DUE SENSE OF PROPORTION, CARTESIAN DOUBT, WHICH IS SYSTEMATIC, WAS NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE DESCARTES A SKEPTIC. IN ANY CASE, HOW CAN ONE LIMIT ONESELF TO SAYING THAT NOTHING HAS MEANING AND THAT WE MUST PLUNGE INTO ABSOLUTE DESPAIR? WITHOUT GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS, ONE CAN AT LEAST MENTION THAT JUST AS THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE MATERIALISM, SINCE MERELY TO FORM THIS WORD IS ALREADY TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING IN THE WORLD APART FROM MATTER, THERE IS LIKEWISE NO TOTAL NIHILISM. THE MOMENT YOU SAY THAT EVERYTHING IS NONSENSE YOU EXPRESS SOMETHING MEANINGFUL. REFUSING THE WORLD ALL MEANING AMOUNTS TO ABOLISHING ALL VALUE JUDGMENTS. BUT LIVING, AND EATING, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE IN THEMSELVES VALUE JUDGMENTS. YOU CHOOSE TO REMAIN ALIVE THE MOMENT YOU DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO DIE OF HUNGER, AND CONSEQUENTLY YOU RECOGNIZE THAT LIFE HAS AT LEAST A RELATIVE VALUE. WHAT, IN FACT, DOES “LITERATURE OF DESPAIR” MEAN? DESPAIR IS SILENT. EVEN SILENCE, MOREOVER, IS MEANINGFUL IF YOUR EYES SPEAK. TRUE DESPAIR IS THE AGONY OF DEATH, THE GRAVE OR THE ABYSS. IF HE SPEAKS, IF HE REASONS, ABOVE ALL IF HE WRITES, IMMEDIATELY THE BROTHER REACHES OUT HIS HAND, THE TREE IS JUSTIFIED, LOVE IS BORN. LITERATURE OF DESPAIR IS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.

OF COURSE, A CERTAIN OPTIMISM IS NOT MY SPECIALITY. LIKE ALL MEN OF MY AGE, I GREW UP TO THE SOUND OF THE DRUMS OF THE FIRST WORLD WAR, AND OUR HISTORY SINCE THAT TIME HAS REMAINED MURDER, INJUSTICE, OR VIOLENCE. BUT REAL PESSIMISM, WHICH DOES EXIST, LIES IN OUTBIDDING ALL THIS CRUELTY AND SHAME. FOR MY PART, I HAVE NEVER CEASED FIGHTING AGAINST THIS DISHONOR, AND I HATE ONLY THE CRUEL. I HAVE SOUGHT ONLY REASONS TO TRANSCEND OUR DARKEST NIHILISM. NOT, I WOULD ADD, THROUGH VIRTUE, NOR BECAUSE OF SOME RARE ELEVATION OF THE SPIRIT, BUT FROM AN INSTINCTIVE FIDELITY TO A LIGHT IN WHICH I WAS BORN, AND IN WHICH FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN HAVE LEARNED TO WELCOME LIFE EVEN IN SUFFERING. AESCHYLUS IS OFTEN HEARTBREAKING; YET HE RADIATES LIGHT AND WARMTH. AT THE CENTER OF HIS UNIVERSE, WE FIND NOT FLESHLESS NONSENSE BUT AN ENIGMA, THAT IS TO SAY, A MEANING WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER BECAUSE IT DAZZLES US. LIKEWISE, TO THE UNWORTHY BUT NONETHELESS STUBBORN SONS OF GREECE WHO STILL SURVIVE IN THIS EMACIATED CENTURY, THE SCORCHING HEAT OF OUR HISTORY MAY SEEM UNENDURABLE, BUT THEY ENDURE IT IN THE LAST ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND IT. IN THE CENTER OF OUR WORK, DARK THOUGH IT MAY BE, SHINES AN INEXHAUSTIBLE SUN, THE SAME SUN THAT SHOUTS TODAY ACROSS THE HILLS AND PLAIN.

AFTER THIS, THE FLAXEN FIRE CAN BURN; WHO CARES WHAT WE APPEAR TO BE AND WHAT WE USURP? WHAT WE ARE, WHAT WE HAVE TO BE, ARE ENOUGH TO FILL OUR LIVES AND OCCUPY OUR STRENGTH. PARIS IS A WONDROUS CAVE, AND ITS INHABITANTS, SEEING THEIR OWN SHADOWS REFLECTED ON THE FAR WALL, TAKE THEM FOR THE ONLY REALITY THERE IS. THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE STRANGE, FLEETING RENOWN THIS TOWN DISPENSES. BUT WE HAVE LEARNED, FAR FROM PARIS, THAT THERE IS A LIGHT BEHIND US, THAT WE MUST TURN AROUND AND CAST OFF OUR CHAINS IN ORDER TO FACE IT DIRECTLY, AND THAT OUR TASK BEFORE WE DIE IS TO SEEK THROUGH ANY WORDS TO IDENTIFY IT. EVERY ARTIST IS UNDOUBTEDLY PURSUING HIS TRUTH. IF HE IS A GREAT ARTIST, EACH WORK BRINGS HIM NEARER TO IT, OR, AT LEAST, SWINGS STILL CLOSER TOWARD THIS CENTER, THIS BURIED SUN WHERE EVERYTHING MUST ONE DAY BURN. IF HE IS MEDIOCRE, EACH WORK TAKES HIM FURTHER FROM IT, THE CENTER IS THEN EVERYWHERE, THE LIGHT DISINTEGRATES. BUT THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP THE ARTIST IN HIS OBSTINATE QUEST ARE THOSE WHO LOVE HIM, AND THOSE WHO, THEMSELVES LOVERS OR CREATORS, FIND IN THEIR OWN PASSION THE MEASURE OF ALL PASSION, AND HENCE KNOW HOW TO CRITICIZE.

YES, ALL THIS NOISE…WHEN PEACE WOULD BE TO LOVE AND CREATE IN SILENCE! BUT WE MUST LEARN TO BE PATIENT. ONE MOMENT MORE, THE SUN SEALS OUR MOUTHS.


YOU SAILED AWAY FROM YOUR FATHER’S DWELLING

WITH YOUR HEART ON FIRE, MEDEA! AND YOU PASSED

BETWEEN THE ROCKY GATES OF THE SEAS;

AND NOW YOU SLEEP ON A FOREIGN SHORE.

—MEDEA

FOR FIVE DAYS THE RAIN HAD BEEN FAILING UNCEASINGLY ON ALGIERS, FINALLY DRENCHING THE SEA ITSELF. FROM THE HEIGHTS OF AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE SKY, UNENDING SHEETS OF RAIN, SO THICK THEY WERE VISCOUS, CRASHED INTO THE GULF. SOFT AND GRAY LIKE A GREAT SPONGE, THE SEA HEAVED IN THE SHAPELESS BAY. BUT THE SURFACE OF THE WATER SEEMED ALMOST MOTIONLESS BENEATH THE STEADY RAIN. AT LONG INTERVALS, HOWEVER, A BROAD AND IMPERCEPTIBLE MOVEMENT RAISED A MURKY CLOUD OF STEAM FROM THE SEA AND ROLLED IT INTO THE HARBOR, BELOW A CIRCLE OF SOAKING BOULEVARDS. THE TOWN ITSELF, ITS WHITE WALLS RUNNING WITH DAMP, GAVE OFF ANOTHER CLOUD OF STEAM THAT BILLOWED OUT TO MEET THE FIRST. WHICHEVER WAY YOU TURNED YOU SEEMED TO BE BREATHING WATER, YOU COULD DRINK THE VERY AIR.

LOOKING AT THIS DROWNED SEA, SEEING IN DECEMBER AN ALGIERS THAT WAS STILL FOR ME THE CITY OF SUMMERS, I WALKED ABOUT AND WAITED. I HAD FLED FROM THE NIGHT OF EUROPE, FROM A WINTER OF FACES. BUT EVEN THE TOWN OF SUMMERS WAS EMPTIED OF ITS LAUGHTER, OFFERING ME ONLY HUNCHED AND STREAMING BACKS. IN THE EVENING, IN THE FIERCELY LIT CAFÉS WHERE I SOUGHT REFUGE, I READ MY AGE ON FACES I RECOGNIZED WITHOUT KNOWING THEIR NAMES. ALL I KNEW WAS THAT THESE MEN HAD BEEN YOUNG WHEN I WAS, AND THAT NOW THEY WERE YOUNG NO LONGER.

I STAYED ON, THOUGH, WITHOUT ANY CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT I WAS WAITING FOR, EXCEPT, PERHAPS, THE MOMENT WHEN I COULD GO BACK TO TIPASA. IT IS CERTAINLY A GREAT FOLLY, AND ONE THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS PUNISHED, TO GO BACK TO THE PLACES OF ONE’S YOUTH, TO WANT TO RELIVE AT FORTY THE THINGS ONE LOVED OR GREATLY ENJOYED AT TWENTY. BUT I WAS AWARE OF THIS FOLLY. I HAD ALREADY BEEN BACK TO TIPASA ONCE, NOT LONG AFTER THOSE WAR YEARS THAT MARKED FOR ME THE END OF MY YOUTH. I HOPED, I THINK, TO REDISCOVER THERE A LIBERTY I WAS UNABLE TO FORGET. HERE, MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO, I HAD SPENT WHOLE MORNINGS WANDERING AMONG THE RUINS, BREATHING THE SCENT OF ABSINTHE, WARMING MYSELF AGAINST THE STONES, DISCOVERING THE TINY, SHORT-LIVED ROSES THAT SURVIVE IN SPRINGTIME. ONLY AT NOON, WHEN EVEN THE CRICKETS ARE SILENCED BY THE HEAT, WOULD I FLEE FROM THE AVID BLAZE OF AN ALL-CONSUMING LIGHT. SOMETIMES, AT NIGHT, I WOULD SLEEP OPEN-EYED BENEATH A SKY FLOWING WITH STARS. I WAS ALIVE AT THOSE MOMENTS. FIFTEEN YEARS LATER, I FOUND MY RUINS AGAIN. A FEW STEPS FROM THE FIRST WAVES, I FOLLOWED THE STREETS OF THE FORGOTTEN CITY ACROSS THE FIELDS COVERED WITH BITTER TREES; AND, ON THE HILLS OVERLOOKING THE BAY, COULD STILL CARESS THEIR PILLARS, WHICH WERE THE COLOR OF BREAD. BUT NOW THE RUINS WERE SURROUNDED BY BARBED WIRE, AND COULD BE REACHED ONLY THROUGH OFFICIAL ENTRANCES. IT WAS ALSO FORBIDDEN, FOR REASONS SANCTIONED, IT WOULD SEEM, BY MORALITY, TO WALK THERE AFTER DARK; BY DAY, ONE WOULD MEET AN OFFICIAL GUARD. THAT MORNING, DOUBTLESS BY CHANCE, IT WAS RAINING ACROSS THE WHOLE SWEEP OF THE RUINS.

BEWILDERED, WALKING THROUGH THE LONELY, RAIN-SOAKED COUNTRYSIDE, I TRIED AT LEAST TO RECOVER THE STRENGTH THAT HAS SO FAR NEVER FAILED ME, THAT HELPS ME TO ACCEPT WHAT IS, ONCE I HAVE REALIZED I CANNOT CHANGE IT. I COULD NOT, OF COURSE, TRAVEL BACKWARD THROUGH TIME AND RESTORE TO THIS WORLD THE FACE I HAD LOVED, WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN A SINGLE DAY A LONG TIME BEFORE. ON THE SECOND OF SEPTEMBER, 1939, I DID NOT GO TO GREECE, AS I HAD PLANNED. INSTEAD, THE WAR ENVELOPED US, THEN GREECE ITSELF. THIS DISTANCE, THESE YEARS SEPARATING THE WARM RUINS FROM THE BARBED WIRE, WERE ALSO WITHIN ME, AS I STOOD THAT DAY STARING AT TOMBS FILLED WITH BLACK WATER OR BENEATH THE DRIPPING TAMARISK TREES. RAISED ABOVE ALL IN THE SPECTACLE OF A BEAUTY THAT WAS MY ONLY WEALTH, I HAD BEGUN IN PLENTY. THE BARBED WIRE CAME LATER—I MEAN TYRANNIES, WAR, POLICINGS, THE TIME OF REVOLT. WE HAD HAD TO COME TO TERMS WITH NIGHT: THE BEAUTY OF DAYTIME WAS ONLY A MEMORY. AND IN THIS MUDDY TIPASA, EVEN THE MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM. NO ROOM NOW FOR BEAUTY, FULLNESS, OR YOUTH! IN THE LIGHT CAST BY THE FLAMES, THE WORLD HAD SUDDENLY SHOWN ITS WRINKLES AND ITS AFFLICTIONS, OLD AND NEW. IT HAD SUDDENLY GROWN OLD, AND WE HAD TOO. I KNEW THE ARDOR I HAD COME IN SEARCH OF COULD ONLY BE ROUSED IN SOMEONE NOT EXPECTING IT. THERE IS NO LOVE WITHOUT A LITTLE INNOCENCE. WHERE WAS INNOCENCE? EMPIRES WERE CRUMBLING, MEN AND NATIONS WERE TEARING AT ONE ANOTHER’S THROATS; OUR MOUTHS WERE DIRTIED. INNOCENT AT FIRST WITHOUT KNOWING IT, NOW WE WERE UNINTENTIONALLY GUILTY: THE MORE WE KNEW, THE GREATER THE MYSTERY. THIS IS WHY WE BUSIED OURSELVES, OH MOCKERY, WITH MORALITY. FRAIL IN SPIRIT, I DREAMED OF VIRTUE! IN THE DAYS OF INNOCENCE, I DID NOT KNOW MORALITY EXISTED. NOW I KNEW IT DID, AND COULD NOT LIVE UP TO IT. ON THE PROMONTORY I HAD LOVED IN FORMER DAYS, BETWEEN THE DRENCHED PILLARS OF THE RUINED TEMPLE, I SEEMED TO BE WALKING BEHIND SOMEONE WHOSE FOOTSTEPS I COULD STILL HEAR ON THE TOMBSTONES AND MOSAICS, BUT WHOM I WOULD NEVER CATCH UP WITH AGAIN. I WENT BACK TO PARIS, AND STAYED FOR SOME YEARS BEFORE RETURNING HOME AGAIN.

DURING ALL THESE YEARS, HOWEVER, I HAD A VAGUE FEELING OF MISSING SOMETHING. ONCE YOU HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO LOVE INTENSELY, YOUR LIFE IS SPENT IN SEARCH OF THE SAME LIGHT AND THE SAME ARDOR. TO GIVE UP BEAUTY AND THE SENSUAL HAPPINESS THAT COMES WITH IT AND DEVOTE ONE’S SELF EXCLUSIVELY TO UNHAPPINESS REQUIRES A NOBILITY I LACK. BUT, AFTER ALL, NOTHING IS TRUE THAT COMPELS US TO MAKE IT EXCLUSIVE. ISOLATED BEAUTY ENDS IN GRIMACES, SOLITARY JUSTICE IN OPPRESSION. ANYONE WHO SEEKS TO SERVE THE ONE TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE OTHER SERVES NO ONE, NOT EVEN HIMSELF, AND IN THE END IS DOUBLY THE SERVANT OF INJUSTICE. A DAY COMES WHEN, BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN INFLEXIBLE, NOTHING AMAZES US ANYMORE, EVERYTHING IS KNOWN, AND OUR LIFE IS SPENT IN STARTING AGAIN. IT IS A TIME OF EXILE, DRY LIVES, DEAD SOULS. TO COME BACK TO LIFE, WE NEED GRACE, A HOMELAND, OR TO FORGET OURSELVES. ON CERTAIN MORNINGS, AS WE TURN A CORNER, AN EXQUISITE DEW FALLS ON OUR HEART AND THEN VANISHES. BUT THE FRESHNESS LINGERS, AND THIS, ALWAYS, IS WHAT THE HEART NEEDS. I HAD TO COME BACK ONCE AGAIN.

AND, IN ALGIERS A SECOND TIME, STILL WALKING UNDER THE SAME DOWNPOUR THAT I FELT HAD NOT STOPPED SINCE WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MY FINAL DEPARTURE, IN THE MIDST OF THIS IMMENSE MELANCHOLY SMELLING OF RAIN AND SEA, IN SPITE OF THE MISTY SKY, THE SIGHT OF PEOPLE’S BACKS FLEEING BENEATH THE DELUGE, THE CAFÉS WHOSE SULPHUROUS LIGHT DECOMPOSED EVERYONE’S FACE, I PERSISTED IN MY HOPES. ANYWAY, DIDN’T I KNOW THAT RAIN IN ALGIERS, ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS AS IF IT WOULD GO ON FOREVER, NONETHELESS DOES STOP SUDDENLY, LIKE THE RIVERS IN MY COUNTRY THAT SWELL TO A FLOOD IN TWO HOURS, DEVASTATE ACRES OF LAND, AND DRY UP AGAIN IN AN INSTANT? ONE EVENING, IN FACT, THE RAIN STOPPED. I WAITED STILL ONE MORE NIGHT. A LIQUID MORNING ROSE, DAZZLING, OVER THE PURE SEA. FROM THE SKY, FRESH AS A ROSE, WASHED AND REWASHED BY THE WATERS, REDUCED BY EACH SUCCESSIVE LAUNDERING TO ITS MOST DELICATE AND CLEAREST TEXTURE, A QUIVERING LIGHT FELL, ENDOWING EACH HOUSE, EACH TREE, WITH A PALPABLE SHAPE AND A MAGIC NEWNESS. THE EARTH MUST HAVE RISEN IN JUST SUCH A LIGHT THE MORNING THE WORLD WAS BORN. ONCE AGAIN I SET OUT FOR TIPASA.

THERE IS NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THESE SIXTY-NINE KILOMETERS OF HIGHWAY THAT IS NOT FILLED FOR ME WITH MEMORIES AND SENSATIONS. A VIOLENT CHILDHOOD, ADOLESCENT DAYDREAMS TO THE HUM OF THE BUS’S ENGINES, MORNINGS, THE FRESHNESS OF YOUNG GIRLS, BEACHES, YOUNG MUSCLES ALWAYS TENSED, THE SLIGHT ANGUISH THAT THE EVENING BRINGS TO A SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD HEART, THE DESIRE TO LIVE, GLORY, AND ALWAYS THE SAME SKY, FOR MONTHS ON END, WITH ITS INEXHAUSTIBLE STRENGTH AND LIGHT, AS COMPANION TO THE YEARS, A SKY INSATIABLE, ONE BY ONE DEVOURING VICTIMS LYING CRUCIFIED UPON THE BEACH AT THE FUNEREAL HOUR OF NOON. ALWAYS THE SAME SEA AS WELL, ALMOST IMPALPABLE IN THE MORNING AIR, GLIMPSED AGAIN ON THE HORIZON AS SOON AS THE ROAD, LEAVING THE SAHEL AND ITS HILLS WITH THEIR BRONZE-COLORED VINEYARDS, DIPPED DOWN TOWARD THE COAST. BUT I DID NOT STOP TO LOOK AT IT. I WANTED TO SEE THE CHENOUA AGAIN—THAT HEAVY, SOLID MOUNTAIN, CARVED ALL IN ONE PIECE AND RUNNING ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF TIPASA BAY BEFORE DESCENDING INTO THE SEA. YOU SEE IT FROM FAR AWAY, LONG BEFORE YOU GET THERE, AS A LIGHT BLUE HAZE STILL MINGLING WITH THE SEA. BUT GRADUALLY IT CONDENSES AS YOU COME NEARER, UNTIL IT TAKES ON THE COLOR OF THE WATERS SURROUNDING IT, LIKE AN IMMENSE AND MOTIONLESS WAVE BRUTALLY CAUGHT IN THE VERY ACT OF BREAKING OVER A SUDDENLY CALM SEA. NEARER STILL, ALMOST AT THE GATES OF TIPASA, YOU SEE ITS FROWNING MASS, BROWN AND GREEN, THE OLD, UNSHAKABLE, MOSS-COVERED GOD, PORT AND HAVEN FOR ITS SONS, OF WHOM I AM ONE. I WAS GAZING AT IT AS I FINALLY CROSSED THE BARBED WIRE AND STOOD AMONG THE RUINS. AND, IN THE GLORIOUS DECEMBER LIGHT, AS HAPPENS ONLY ONCE OR TWICE IN LIVES THAT MAY LATER BE DESCRIBED AS HEAPED WITH EVERY BLESSING, I FOUND EXACTLY WHAT I HAD COME IN SEARCH OF, SOMETHING WHICH IN SPITE OF TIME AND IN SPITE OF THE WORLD WAS OFFERED TO ME AND TRULY TO ME ALONE, IN THIS DESERTED NATURE. FROM THE OLIVE-STREWN FORUM, ONE COULD SEE THE VILLAGE DOWN BELOW. NOT A SOUND CAME FROM IT; WISPS OF SMOKE ROSE IN THE LIMPID AIR. THE SEA ALSO LAY SILENT, AS IF BREATHLESS BENEATH THE UNENDING SHOWER OF COLD, GLITTERING LIGHT. FROM THE CHENOUA, A DISTANT COCK CROW ALONE SANG THE FRAGILE GLORY OF THE DAY. ACROSS THE RUINS, AS FAR AS ONE COULD SEE, THERE WERE NOTHING BUT PITTED STONES AND ABSINTHE PLANTS, TREES AND PERFECT COLUMNS IN THE TRANSPARENCE OF THE CRYSTAL AIR. IT WAS AS IF THE MORNING STOOD STILL, AS IF THE SUN HAD STOPPED FOR AN IMMEASURABLE MOMENT. IN THIS LIGHT AND SILENCE, YEARS OF NIGHT AND FURY MELTED SLOWLY AWAY. I LISTENED TO AN ALMOST FORGOTTEN SOUND WITHIN MYSELF, AS IF MY HEART HAD LONG BEEN STOPPED AND WAS NOW GENTLY BEGINNING TO BEAT AGAIN. AND, NOW AWAKE, I RECOGNIZED ONE BY ONE THE IMPERCEPTIBLE SOUNDS THAT MADE UP THE SILENCE: THE BASSO CONTINUO OF THE BIRDS, THE SHORT, LIGHT SIGHING OF THE SEA AT THE FOOT OF THE ROCKS, THE VIBRATION OF THE TREES, THE BLIND SONG OF THE COLUMNS, THE WHISPERING OF THE ABSINTHE PLANTS, THE FURTIVE LIZARDS. I HEARD ALL THIS, AND ALSO FELT THE WAVES OF HAPPINESS RISING UP WITHIN ME. I FELT THAT I HAD AT LAST COME BACK TO HARBOR, FOR A MOMENT AT LEAST, AND THAT FROM NOW ON THIS MOMENT WOULD NEVER END. BUT SOON AFTERWARD THE SUN ROSE VISIBLY A DEGREE HIGHER IN THE SKY. A BLACKBIRD CHIRPED ITS BRIEF PRELUDE AND IMMEDIATELY, FROM ALL AROUND, BIRD VOICES EXPLODED WITH A STRENGTH, A JUBILATION, A JOYFUL DISCORD, AN INFINITE DELIGHT. THE DAY MOVED ON. IT WAS TO CARRY ME THROUGH TILL EVENING.

AT NOON, ON THE HALF-SANDY SLOPES, STREWN WITH HELIOTROPES LIKE A FOAM THAT THE FURIOUS WAVES OF THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD LEFT BEHIND IN THEIR RETREAT, I GAZED AT THE SEA, GENTLY RISING AND FALLING AS IF EXHAUSTED, AND QUENCHED TWO THIRSTS THAT CANNOT BE LONG NEGLECTED IF ALL ONE’S BEING IS NOT TO DRY UP, THE THIRST TO LOVE AND THE THIRST TO ADMIRE. FOR THERE IS ONLY MISFORTUNE IN NOT BEING LOVED; THERE IS MISERY IN NOT LOVING. ALL OF US, TODAY, ARE DYING OF THIS MISERY. THIS IS BECAUSE BLOOD AND HATRED LAY BARE THE HEART ITSELF; THE LONG DEMAND FOR JUSTICE EXHAUSTS EVEN THE LOVE THAT GAVE IT BIRTH. IN THE CLAMOR WE LIVE IN, LOVE IS IMPOSSIBLE AND JUSTICE NOT ENOUGH. THAT IS WHY EUROPE HATES THE DAYLIGHT AND CAN DO NOTHING BUT CONFRONT ONE INJUSTICE WITH ANOTHER. IN ORDER TO PREVENT JUSTICE FROM SHRIVELING UP, FROM BECOMING NOTHING BUT A MAGNIFICENT ORANGE WITH A DRY, BITTER PULP, I DISCOVERED ONE MUST KEEP A FRESHNESS AND A SOURCE OF JOY INTACT WITHIN, LOVING THE DAYLIGHT THAT INJUSTICE LEAVES UNSCATHED, AND RETURNING TO THE FRAY WITH THIS LIGHT AS A TROPHY. HERE, ONCE MORE, I FOUND AN ANCIENT BEAUTY, A YOUNG SKY, AND MEASURED MY GOOD FORTUNE AS I REALIZED AT LAST THAT IN THE WORST YEARS OF OUR MADNESS THE MEMORY OF THIS SKY HAD NEVER LEFT ME. IT WAS THIS THAT IN THE END HAD SAVED ME FROM DESPAIR. I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THE RUINS OF TIPASA WERE YOUNGER THAN OUR DRYDOCKS OR OUR DEBRIS. IN TIPASA, THE WORLD IS BORN AGAIN EACH DAY IN A LIGHT ALWAYS NEW. OH LIGHT! THE CRY OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IN CLASSICAL TRAGEDY WHO COME FACE TO FACE WITH THEIR DESTINIES. I KNEW NOW THAT THEIR FINAL REFUGE WAS ALSO OURS. IN THE DEPTHS OF WINTER, I FINALLY LEARNED THAT WITHIN ME THERE LAY AN INVINCIBLE SUMMER.

—
ONCE MORE I LEFT TIPASA, RETURNING TO EUROPE AND ITS STRUGGLES. BUT THE MEMORY OF THAT DAY SUSTAINS ME STILL AND HELPS ME MEET BOTH JOY AND SORROW WITH EQUANIMITY. IN THE DIFFICULT TIMES WE FACE, WHAT MORE CAN I HOPE FOR THAN THE POWER TO EXCLUDE NOTHING AND TO LEARN TO WEAVE FROM STRANDS OF BLACK AND WHITE ONE ROPE TAUTENED TO THE BREAKING POINT? IN EVERYTHING I’VE DONE OR SAID SO FAR, I SEEM TO RECOGNIZE THESE TWO FORCES, EVEN WHEN THEY CONTRADICT EACH OTHER. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DENY THE LIGHT INTO WHICH I WAS BORN AND YET I HAVE NOT WISHED TO REJECT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF OUR TIME. IT WOULD BE TOO EASY TO SET AGAINST THE GENTLE NAME TIPASA OTHER NAMES MORE SONOROUS AND MORE CRUEL: THERE IS, FOR MAN TODAY, AN INNER PATH THAT I KNOW WELL FROM HAVING TRAVELED BOTH WAYS UPON IT, WHICH LEADS FROM THE SUMMITS OF THE MIND TO THE CAPITALS OF CRIME. AND, DOUBTLESS, ONE CAN ALWAYS REST, SLEEP ON THE HILLSIDE OR SETTLE INTO CRIME. BUT IF WE GIVE UP A PART OF WHAT EXISTS, WE MUST OURSELVES GIVE UP BEING; WE MUST THEN GIVE UP LIVING OR LOVING EXCEPT BY PROXY. THUS THERE IS A WILL TO LIVE WITHOUT REFUSING ANYTHING LIFE OFFERS: THE VIRTUE I HONOR MOST IN THIS WORLD. FROM TIME TO TIME, AT LEAST, IT’S TRUE THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE PRACTICED IT. SINCE FEW TIMES REQUIRE TO THE EXTENT OURS DOES THAT ONE BE AS EQUAL TO THE BEST AS TO THE WORST, TO AVOID NOTHING AND KEEP A DOUBLE MEMORY ALIVE IS PRECISELY WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO. YES, THERE IS BEAUTY AND THERE ARE THE HUMILIATED. WHATEVER DIFFICULTIES THE ENTERPRISE MAY PRESENT, I WOULD LIKE NEVER TO BE UNFAITHFUL EITHER TO THE ONE OR THE OTHER.

BUT THIS STILL SOUNDS LIKE ETHICS, AND WE LIVE FOR SOMETHING THAT TRANSCENDS ETHICS. IF WE COULD NAME IT, WHAT SILENCE WOULD FOLLOW! EAST OF TIPASA, THE HILL OF SAINTE-SALSA, EVENING HAS COME TO LIFE. IT IS STILL LIGHT, OF COURSE, BUT AN INVISIBLE WANING OF THE LIGHT ANNOUNCES THE SUNSET. A WIND RISES, GENTLE AS THE NIGHT, AND SUDDENLY THE UNTROUBLED SEA CHOOSES ITS WAY AND FLOWS LIKE A GREAT BARREN RIVER ACROSS THE HORIZON. THE SKY DARKENS. THEN BEGINS THE MYSTERY, THE GODS OF NIGHT, AND WHAT LIES BEYOND PLEASURE. BUT HOW CAN THIS BE EXPRESSED? THE LITTLE COIN I CARRY BACK FROM HERE HAS ONE CLEAR SIDE, THE FACE OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN THAT REMINDS ME OF WHAT I’VE LEARNED IN THE COURSE OF THIS DAY, WHILE THE OTHER SIDE, WHICH I FEEL BENEATH MY FINGERS HOMEWARD BOUND, HAS BEEN EATEN AWAY. WHAT DOES THIS LIPLESS MOUTH EXPRESS IF NOT WHAT ANOTHER, MYSTERIOUS VOICE WITHIN ME SAYS, THAT DAILY TEACHES ME MY IGNORANCE AND MY HAPPINESS:

THE SECRET I AM LOOKING FOR IS BURIED IN A VALLEY OF OLIVE TREES, BENEATH THE GRASS AND COLD VIOLETS, AROUND AN OLD HOUSE THAT SMELLS OF VINES. FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS I HAVE WANDERED OVER THIS VALLEY, AND OVER OTHERS LIKE IT, QUESTIONING DUMB GOATHERDS, KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF EMPTY RUINS. SOMETIMES, WHEN THE FIRST STAR SHINES IN A STILL, CLEAR SKY, BENEATH A RAIN OF DELICATE LIGHT, I HAVE THOUGHT THAT I KNEW. I DID KNOW, IN FACT. PERHAPS I STILL KNOW. BUT NO ONE IS INTERESTED IN THIS SECRET, DOUBTLESS I MYSELF DO NOT DESIRE IT, AND I CANNOT CUT MYSELF OFF FROM MY OWN PEOPLE. I LIVE WITH MY FAMILY, WHO BELIEVE THEY REIGN OVER RICH AND HIDEOUS CITIES, BUILT OF STONES AND MISTS. DAY AND NIGHT IT RAISES ITS VOICE, AND EVERYTHING YIELDS BENEATH IT WHILE IT BOWS DOWN TO NOTHING: IT IS DEAF TO ALL SECRETS. ITS POWER SUSTAINS ME AND YET BORES ME, AND I COME TO BE WEARY OF ITS CRIES. BUT ITS UNHAPPINESS IS MY OWN, WE ARE OF THE SAME BLOOD. I TOO AM SICK, AND AM I NOT A NOISY ACCOMPLICE WHO HAS CRIED OUT AMONG THE STONES? THUS I TRY TO FORGET, I MARCH THROUGH OUR CITIES OF IRON AND FIRE, I SMILE BRAVELY AT THE NIGHT, I WELCOME THE STORMS, I WILL BE FAITHFUL. IN FACT, I HAVE FORGOTTEN: HENCEFORTH, I SHALL BE DEAF AND ACTIVE. BUT PERHAPS ONE DAY, WHEN WE ARE READY TO DIE OF IGNORANCE AND EXHAUSTION, I SHALL BE ABLE TO RENOUNCE OUR SHRIEKING TOMBS, TO GO AND LIE DOWN IN THE VALLEY, UNDER THE UNCHANGING LIGHT, AND LEARN FOR ONE LAST TIME WHAT I KNOW.

1953


I GREW UP WITH THE SEA AND POVERTY FOR ME WAS SUMPTUOUS; THEN I LOST THE SEA AND FOUND ALL LUXURIES GRAY AND POVERTY UNBEARABLE. SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN WAITING. I WAIT FOR THE HOMEBOUND SHIPS, THE HOUSE OF THE WATERS, THE LIMPIDITY OF DAY. I WAIT PATIENTLY, AM POLITE WITH ALL MY STRENGTH. I AM SEEN WALKING BY ON FINE, SOPHISTICATED STREETS, I ADMIRE LANDSCAPES, I APPLAUD LIKE EVERYONE, SHAKE HANDS, BUT IT IS NOT I WHO SPEAK. MEN PRAISE ME, I DREAM A LITTLE, THEY INSULT ME, I SCARCELY SHOW SURPRISE. THEN I FORGET, AND SMILE AT THE MAN WHO INSULTED ME, OR AM TOO COURTEOUS IN GREETING THE PERSON I LOVE. CAN I HELP IT IF ALL I REMEMBER IS ONE IMAGE? FINALLY THEY SUMMON ME TO TELL THEM WHO I AM. “NOTHING YET, NOTHING YET…”

I SURPASS MYSELF AT FUNERALS. TRULY, I EXCEL. I WALK SLOWLY THROUGH THE IRON-STREWN SUBURBS, TAKING THE WIDE LANES PLANTED WITH CEMENT TREES THAT LEAD TO HOLES IN THE COLD GROUND. THERE, BENEATH THE SLIGHTLY REDDENED BANDAGE OF THE SKY, I WATCH BOLD WORKMEN INTER MY FRIENDS BENEATH SIX FEET OF EARTH. IF I TOSS THE FLOWER A CLAY-COVERED HAND HOLDS OUT TO ME, IT NEVER MISSES THE GRAVE. MY PIETY IS EXACT, MY FEELINGS AS THEY SHOULD BE, MY HEAD SUITABLY INCLINED. I AM ADMIRED FOR FINDING JUST THE RIGHT WORD. BUT I TAKE NO CREDIT: I AM WAITING.

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME. SOMETIMES, I STUMBLE, I LOSE MY TOUCH, SUCCESS EVADES ME. WHAT DOES IT MATTER, I AM ALONE THEN. I WAKE UP AT NIGHT, AND, STILL HALF ASLEEP, THINK I HEAR THE SOUND OF WAVES, THE BREATHING OF WATERS. FULLY AWAKE, I RECOGNIZE THE WIND IN THE TREES AND THE SAD MURMUR OF THE EMPTY TOWN. AFTERWARD, ALL MY ART IS NOT TOO MUCH TO HIDE MY ANGUISH OR CLOTHE IT IN THE PREVAILING FASHION.

AT OTHER TIMES, IT’S THE OPPOSITE, AND I AM HELPED. ON CERTAIN DAYS IN NEW YORK, LOST AT THE BOTTOM OF THOSE STONE AND STEEL SHAFTS WHERE MILLIONS OF MEN WANDER, I WOULD RUN FROM ONE SHAFT TO THE NEXT, WITHOUT SEEING WHERE THEY ENDED, UNTIL, EXHAUSTED, I WAS SUSTAINED ONLY BY THE HUMAN MASS SEEKING ITS WAY OUT. BUT, EACH TIME, THERE WAS THE DISTANT HONKING OF A TUGBOAT TO REMIND ME THAT THIS EMPTY WELL OF A CITY WAS AN ISLAND, AND THAT OFF THE TIP OF THE BATTERY THE WATER OF MY BAPTISM LAY IN WAIT FOR ME, BLACK AND ROTTING, COVERED WITH HOLLOW CORKS.

THUS, I WHO OWN NOTHING, WHO HAVE GIVEN AWAY MY FORTUNE, WHO CAMP IN ALL MY HOUSES, AM STILL HEAPED, WHEN I CHOOSE, WITH EVERY BLESSING; I CAN SET SAIL AT ANY HOUR, A STRANGER TO DESPAIR. THERE IS NO COUNTRY FOR THOSE WHO DESPAIR, BUT I KNOW THAT THE SEA PRECEDES AND FOLLOWS ME, AND I HOLD MY MADNESS READY. THOSE WHO LOVE AND ARE SEPARATED CAN LIVE IN GRIEF, BUT THIS IS NOT DESPAIR: THEY KNOW THAT LOVE EXISTS. THIS IS WHY I SUFFER, DRY-EYED, IN EXILE, I AM STILL WAITING. A DAY COMES, AT LAST…

—
THE SAILORS’ BARE FEET BEAT SOFTLY ON THE DECK. WE ARE SETTING SAIL AT DAYBREAK. THE MOMENT WE LEAVE THE HARBOR A SHORT, GUSTY WIND VIGOROUSLY BRUSHES THE SEA, WHICH CURLS BACKWARD IN SMALL, FOAMLESS WAVES. A LITTLE LATER, THE WIND FRESHENS AND STREWS THE SEA WITH SWIFTLY VANISHING CAMELLIAS. THUS, THROUGHOUT THE MORNING, WE HEAR OUR SAILS SLAPPING ABOVE A CHEERFUL POND. THE WATERS ARE HEAVY, SCALY, COVERED WITH COOL FROTH. FROM TIME TO TIME THE WAVES LAP AGAINST THE BOW; A BITTER, UNCTUOUS FOAM, THE GODS’ SALIVA, FLOWS ALONG THE WOOD AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE WATER, WHERE IT SCATTERS INTO SHAPES THAT DIE AND ARE REBORN, THE HIDE OF SOME WHITE AND BLUE COW, AN EXHAUSTED BEAST THAT FLOATS FOR A LONG TIME IN OUR WAKE.

—
EVER SINCE OUR DEPARTURE, THE SEAGULLS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING OUR SHIP, APPARENTLY WITHOUT EFFORT, ALMOST WITHOUT MOVING THEIR WINGS. THEIR FINE, STRAIGHT NAVIGATION SCARCELY LEANS UPON THE BREEZE. SUDDENLY, A LOUD PLOP AT THE LEVEL OF THE KITCHENS STIRS UP A GREEDY ALARM AMONG THE BIRDS, THROWING THEIR FINE FLIGHT INTO CONFUSION AND SENDING UP A FIRE OF WHITE WINGS. THE SEAGULLS WHIRL MADLY IN EVERY DIRECTION AND THEN WITH NO LOSS OF SPEED DROP FROM THE FIGHT ONE BY ONE AND DIVE TOWARD THE SEA. A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY ARE TOGETHER AGAIN ON THE WATER, A QUARRELSOME FARMYARD THAT WE LEAVE BEHIND, NESTING IN THE HOLLOW OF THE WAVE, SLOWLY PICKING THROUGH THE MANNA OF THE SCRAPS.

—
AT NOON, UNDER A DEAFENING SUN, THE SEA IS SO EXHAUSTED IT SCARCELY FINDS THE STRENGTH TO RISE. WHEN IT FALLS BACK ON ITSELF IT MAKES THE SILENCE WHISTLE. AFTER AN HOUR’S COOKING, THE PALE WATER, A VAST WHITE-HOT IRON SHEET, SIZZLES. IN A MINUTE IT WILL TURN AND OFFER ITS DAMP SIDE, NOW HIDDEN IN WAVES AND DARKNESS, TO THE SUN.

—
WE PASS THE GATES OF HERCULES, THE HEADLAND WHERE ANTAEUS DIED. BEYOND, THERE IS OCEAN EVERYWHERE; ON ONE SIDE WE PASS THE HORN AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE, THE MERIDIANS WED THE LATITUDES, THE PACIFIC DRINKS THE ATLANTIC. AT ONCE, SETTING COURSE FOR VANCOUVER, WE SAIL SLOWLY TOWARD THE SOUTH SEAS. A FEW CABLE LENGTHS AWAY, EASTER ISLAND, DESOLATION, AND THE NEW HEBRIDES FILE PAST US IN CONVOY. SUDDENLY, ONE MORNING, THE SEAGULLS DISAPPEAR. WE ARE FAR FROM ANY LAND, AND ALONE, WITH OUR SAILS AND OUR ENGINES.

—
ALONE ALSO WITH THE HORIZON. THE WAVES COME FROM THE INVISIBLE EAST, PATIENTLY, ONE BY ONE; THEY REACH US, AND THEN, PATIENTLY, SET OFF AGAIN FOR THE UNKNOWN WEST, ONE BY ONE. A LONG VOYAGE, WITH NO BEGINNING AND NO END…RIVERS AND STREAMS PASS BY, THE SEA PASSES AND REMAINS. THIS IS HOW ONE OUGHT TO LOVE, FAITHFUL AND FLEETING. I WED THE SEA.

—
THE HIGH SEAS. THE SUN SINKS AND IS SWALLOWED BY THE FOG LONG BEFORE IT REACHES THE HORIZON. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, THE SEA IS PINK ON ONE SIDE AND BLUE ON THE OTHER. THEN THE WATERS GROW DARKER. THE SCHOONER SLIDES, MINUTE, OVER THE SURFACE OF A PERFECT CIRCLE OF THICK, TARNISHED METAL. AND, AT THE MOST PEACEFUL HOUR, AS EVENING COMES, HUNDREDS OF PORPOISES EMERGE FROM THE WATER, FROLIC AROUND US FOR A MOMENT, THEN FLEE TO THE HORIZON WHERE THERE ARE NO MEN. WITH THEM GONE, SILENCE AND THE ANGUISH OF PRIMITIVE WATERS ARE WHAT REMAIN.

—
A LITTLE LATER STILL, WE MEET AN ICEBERG ON THE TROPIC. INVISIBLE, TO BE SURE, AFTER ITS LONG VOYAGE IN THESE WARM WATERS, BUT STILL EFFECTIVE: IT PASSES TO STARBOARD, WHERE THE RIGGING IS BRIEFLY COVERED WITH A FROSTY DEW, WHILE TO PORT THE DAY DIES WITHOUT MOISTURE.

—
NIGHT DOES NOT FALL AT SEA. IT RISES, RATHER, TOWARD THE STILL PALE SKY, FROM THE DEPTHS OF WATERS AN ALREADY DROWNED SUN GRADUALLY DARKENS WITH ITS THICK ASHES. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, VENUS SHINES ALONE ABOVE THE BLACK WAVES. IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE, STARS SWARM IN THE LIQUID NIGHT.

—
THE MOON HAS RISEN. FIRST IT LIGHTS THE WATER’S SURFACE GENTLY, THEN CLIMBS HIGHER AND INSCRIBES ITSELF IN THE SUPPLE WATER. AT LAST, AT ITS ZENITH, IT LIGHTS A WHOLE CORRIDOR OF SEA, A RICH RIVER OF MILK WHICH, WITH THE MOTION OF THE SHIP, STREAMS DOWN INEXHAUSTIBLY TOWARD US ACROSS THE DARK OCEAN. HERE IS THE FAITHFUL NIGHT, THE COOL NIGHT I CALLED FOR IN THE ROLLICKING LIGHTS, THE ALCOHOL, THE TUMULT OF DESIRE.

—
WE SAIL ACROSS SPACES SO VAST THEY SEEM UNENDING. SUN AND MOON RISE AND FALL IN TURN, ON THE SAME THREAD OF LIGHT AND NIGHT. DAYS AT SEA, AS SIMILAR EACH TO THE OTHER AS HAPPINESS…

THIS LIFE REBELLIOUS TO FORGETFULNESS, REBELLIOUS TO MEMORY, THAT STEVENSON SPEAKS OF.

—
DAWN. WE SAIL PERPENDICULARLY ACROSS THE TROPIC OF CANCER, THE WATERS GROAN AND ARE CONVULSED. DAY BREAKS OVER A SURGING SEA, FULL OF STEEL SPANGLES. THE SKY IS WHITE WITH MIST AND HEAT, WITH A DEAD BUT UNBEARABLE GLARE, AS IF THE SUN HAD TURNED LIQUID IN THE THICKNESS OF THE CLOUDS, OVER THE WHOLE EXPANSE OF THE CELESTIAL VAULT. A SICK SKY OVER A DECOMPOSING SEA. AS THE DAY DRAWS ON, THE HEAT GROWS IN THE WHITE AIR. ALL DAY LONG, OUR BOW NOSES OUT CLOUDS OF FLYING FISH, TINY IRON BIRDS, FORCING THEM FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES IN THE WAVES.

—
IN THE AFTERNOON, WE MEET A STEAMER BOUND FOR HOME. THE SALUTE OUR FOGHORNS EXCHANGE WITH THREE GREAT PREHISTORIC HOOTS, THE SIGNALS OF PASSENGERS LOST AT SEA WARNING THERE ARE OTHER HUMANS PRESENT, THE GRADUALLY INCREASING DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO SHIPS, THEIR SEPARATION AT LAST ON THE MALEVOLENT WATERS, ALL THIS FILLS THE HEART WITH PAIN. THESE STUBBORN MADMEN, CLINGING TO PLANKS TOSSED UPON THE MANE OF IMMENSE OCEANS, IN PURSUIT OF DRIFTING ISLANDS: WHAT MAN WHO CHERISHES SOLITUDE AND THE SEA WILL EVER KEEP HIMSELF FROM LOVING THEM?

—
IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC, WE BEND BENEATH THE SAVAGE WINDS THAT BLOW ENDLESSLY FROM POLE TO POLE. EACH CRY WE UTTER IS LOST, FLIES OFF INTO LIMITLESS SPACE. BUT THIS SHOUT, CARRIED DAY AFTER DAY ON THE WINDS, WILL FINALLY REACH LAND AT ONE OF THE FLATTENED ENDS OF THE EARTH AND ECHO TIMELESSLY AGAINST THE FROZEN WALLS UNTIL A MAN, LOST SOMEWHERE IN HIS SHELL OF SNOW, HEARS IT AND WANTS TO SMILE WITH HAPPINESS.

I WAS HALF ASLEEP IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON SUN WHEN A TERRIBLE NOISE AWOKE ME. I SAW THE SUN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA, THE WAVES REINING IN THE SURGING HEAVENS. SUDDENLY, THE SEA WAS AFIRE, THE SUN FLOWED IN LONG ICY DRAUGHTS DOWN MY THROAT. THE SAILORS LAUGHED AND WEPT AROUND ME. THEY LOVED, BUT COULD NOT FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER. I RECOGNIZED THE WORLD FOR WHAT IT WAS THAT DAY. I DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT ITS GOOD MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME BE EVIL AND ITS TRANSGRESSIONS BENEFICIAL. I REALIZED THAT DAY THAT THERE WERE TWO TRUTHS, AND THAT ONE OF THEM OUGHT NEVER TO BE UTTERED.

—
THE CURIOUS AUSTRAL MOON, LOOKING SLIGHTLY PARED, KEEPS US COMPANY FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS AND THEN SLIDES RAPIDLY FROM THE SKY INTO THE SEA, WHICH SWALLOWS IT. THE SOUTHERN CROSS, THE INFREQUENT STARS, THE POROUS AIR REMAIN. AT THE SAME INSTANT, THE WIND CEASES. THE SKY ROLLS AND PITCHES ABOVE OUR IMMOBILE MASTS. ENGINE DEAD, SAILS HOVE TO, WE ARE WHISTLING IN THE WARM NIGHT AS THE WATER BEATS AMICABLY AGAINST OUR SIDES. NO COMMANDS, THE MACHINES ARE SILENT. WHY INDEED SHOULD WE CONTINUE AND WHY RETURN? OUR CUP RUNNETH OVER, A MUTE RAPTURE LULLS US INVINCIBLY TO SLEEP. THERE ARE DAYS LIKE THIS WHEN ALL IS ACCOMPLISHED; WE MUST LET OURSELVES FLOW WITH THEM, LIKE SWIMMERS WHO KEEP ON UNTIL EXHAUSTED. WHAT CAN WE ACCOMPLISH? I HAVE ALWAYS CONCEALED IT FROM MYSELF. OH BITTER BED, PRINCELY COUCH, THE CROWN LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAS.

—
IN THE MORNING, THE LUKEWARM WATER FOAMS GENTLY UNDER OUR PROPELLER. WE PUT ON SPEED. TOWARD NOON, TRAVELING FROM DISTANT CONTINENTS, A HERD OF WALRUSES CROSS OUR PATH, OVERTAKE US, AND SWIM RHYTHMICALLY TO THE NORTH, FOLLOWED BY MULTICOLORED BIRDS WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME ALIGHT UPON THEIR TUSKS. THIS RUSTLING FOREST SLOWLY VANISHES ON THE HORIZON. A LITTLE LATER THE SEA IS COVERED WITH STRANGE YELLOW FLOWERS. TOWARD EVENING, FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR, WE ARE PRECEDED BY AN INVISIBLE SONG. COMFORTABLY, I FALL ASLEEP.

—
ALL SAILS STRETCHED TO THE KEEN BREEZE, WE SKIM ACROSS A CLEAR AND RIPPLING SEA. AT TOP SPEED, OUR HELM GOES HARD TO PORT. AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL, CORRECTING OUR COURSE AGAIN, LISTING SO FAR TO STARBOARD THAT OUR SAILS SKIM THE WATER, WE SAIL RAPIDLY ALONG THE SIDE OF A SOUTHERN CONTINENT I RECOGNIZE FROM HAVING ONCE FLOWN BLINDLY OVER IT IN THE BARBAROUS COFFIN OF AN AIRPLANE. I WAS AN IDLE KING AND MY CHARIOT DAWDLED; I WAITED FOR THE SEA BUT IT NEVER CAME. THE MONSTER ROARED, TOOK OFF FROM THE GUANO FIELDS OF PERU, HURLED ITSELF ABOVE THE BEACHES OF THE PACIFIC, FLEW OVER THE FRACTURED WHITE VERTEBRAE OF THE ANDES AND THEN ABOVE THE HERDS OF FLIES THAT COVER THE IMMENSE ARGENTINIAN PLAIN, LINKING IN ONE SWOOP THE MILK-DROWNED URUGUAYAN MEADOWS TO VENEZUELA’S BLACK RIVERS, LANDING, ROARING AGAIN, QUIVERING WITH GREED AT THE SIGHT OF NEW EMPTY SPACES TO DEVOUR, AND YET NEVER FAILING TO MOVE FORWARD OR AT LEAST DOING SO ONLY WITH A CONVULSED, OBSTINATE SLOWNESS, A FIXED, WEARY, AND INTOXICATED ENERGY. I FELT I WAS DYING IN THIS METALLIC CELL AND DREAMED OF BLOODSHED AND ORGIES. WITHOUT SPACE, THERE IS NEITHER INNOCENCE NOR LIBERTY! WHEN A MAN CANNOT BREATHE, PRISON MEANS DEATH OR MADNESS; WHAT CAN HE DO THERE BUT KILL AND POSSESS? BUT TODAY I HAVE ALL THE AIR I NEED, ALL OUR SAILS SLAP IN THE BLUE AIR, I AM GOING TO SHOUT AT THE SPEED, WE’LL TOSS OUR SEXTANTS AND COMPASSES INTO THE SEA.

—
OUR SAILS ARE LIKE IRON UNDER THE IMPERIOUS WIND. THE COAST DRIFTS AT FULL SPEED BEFORE OUR EYES, FORESTS OF ROYAL COCONUT TREES WHOSE FEET ARE BATHED BY EMERALD LAGOONS, A QUIET BAY, FULL OF RED SAILS, MOONLIT BEACHES. GREAT BUILDINGS LOOM UP, ALREADY CRACKING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE VIRGIN FOREST THAT BEGINS IN THE BACK YARDS; HERE AND THERE A YELLOW IPECAC OR A TREE WITH VIOLET BRANCHES BURSTS THROUGH A WINDOW; RIO FINALLY CRUMBLES AWAY BEHIND US AND THE MONKEYS OF THE TIJUCA WILL LAUGH AND GIBBER IN THE VEGETATION THAT WILL COVER ITS NEW RUINS. FASTER STILL, ALONG WIDE BEACHES WHERE THE WAVES SPREAD OUT IN SHEAVES OF SAND, FASTER STILL, WHERE THE URUGUAYAN SHEEP WADE INTO THE SEA AND INSTANTLY TURN IT YELLOW. THEN, ON THE ARGENTINIAN COAST, GREAT COARSE HEAPS OF BURNING KINDLING, SET UP AT REGULAR INTERVALS, RAISE SLOWLY GRILLING HALVES OF OXEN TO THE SKY. AT NIGHT, THE ICE FROM TIERRA DEL FUEGO COMES AND BEATS FOR HOURS AGAINST OUR HULL, THE SHIP HARDLY LOSES SPEED AND TACKS ABOUT. IN THE MORNING, THE SINGLE WAVE OF THE PACIFIC, WHOSE COLD FOAM BOILS GREEN AND WHITE FOR THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS ALONG THE CHILEAN COAST, SLOWLY LIFTS US UP AND THREATENS TO WRECK US. THE HELM AVOIDS IT, OVERTAKES THE KERGUELEN ISLANDS. IN THE SWEETISH EVENING THE FIRST MALAYAN BOATS COME OUT TO MEET US.

—
“TO SEA! TO SEA!” SHOUTED THE MARVELOUS BOYS IN ONE OF THE BOOKS FROM MY CHILDHOOD. I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT BOOK EXCEPT THIS CRY. “TO SEA!”, AND ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN INTO THE CORRIDOR OF THE RED SEA, WHERE ON SILENT NIGHTS ONE CAN HEAR THE DESERT STONES, SCORCHED IN THE DAYTIME, FREEZE AND CRACK ONE BY ONE AS WE RETURN TO THE ANCIENT SEA IN WHICH ALL CRIES ARE HUSHED.

—
FINALLY, ONE MORNING, WE DROP ANCHOR IN A BAY FILLED WITH A STRANGE SILENCE, BEACONED WITH FIXED SAILS. A FEW SEA BIRDS ARE QUARRELLING IN THE SKY OVER SCRAPS OF REEDS. WE SWIM ASHORE TO AN EMPTY BEACH; ALL DAY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND DRYING OFF ON THE SAND. WHEN EVENING COMES, UNDER A SKY THAT TURNS GREEN AND FADES INTO THE DISTANCE, THE SEA, ALREADY CALM, GROWS MORE PEACEFUL STILL. SHORT WAVES SHOWER VAPOROUS FOAM ON THE LUKEWARM SHORE. THE SEA BIRDS HAVE DISAPPEARED. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS SPACE, OPEN TO A MOTIONLESS VOYAGE.

—
KNOWING THAT CERTAIN NIGHTS WHOSE SWEETNESS LINGERS WILL KEEP RETURNING TO THE EARTH AND SEA AFTER WE ARE GONE, YES, THIS HELPS US DIE. GREAT SEA, EVER IN MOTION, EVER VIRGIN, MY RELIGION ALONG WITH NIGHT! IT WASHES AND SATIATES US IN ITS STERILE BILLOWS, FREES US AND HOLDS US UPRIGHT. EACH BREAKER BRINGS ITS PROMISE, ALWAYS THE SAME. WHAT DOES EACH SAY? IF I WERE TO DIE SURROUNDED BY COLD MOUNTAINS, IGNORED BY THE WORLD, AN OUTCAST, AT THE END OF MY STRENGTH, AT THE FINAL MOMENT THE SEA WOULD FLOOD MY CELL, WOULD LIFT ME ABOVE MYSELF AND HELP ME DIE WITHOUT HATRED.

—
AT MIDNIGHT, ALONE ON THE SHORE. A MOMENT MORE, AND I SHALL SET SAIL. THE SKY ITSELF HAS WEIGHED ANCHOR, WITH ALL ITS STARS, LIKE THE SHIPS COVERED WITH LIGHTS WHICH AT THIS VERY HOUR THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ILLUMINATE DARK HARBORS. SPACE AND SILENCE WEIGH EQUALLY UPON THE HEART. A SUDDEN LOVE, A GREAT WORK, A DECISIVE ACT, A THOUGHT THAT TRANSFIGURES, ALL THESE AT CERTAIN MOMENTS BRING THE SAME UNBEARABLE ANXIETY, QUICKENED WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARM. LIVING LIKE THIS, IN THE DELICIOUS ANGUISH OF BEING, IN EXQUISITE PROXIMITY TO A DANGER WHOSE NAME WE DO NOT KNOW, IS THIS THE SAME AS RUSHING TO OUR DOOM? ONCE AGAIN, WITHOUT RESPITE, LET US RACE TO OUR DESTRUCTION.

—
I HAVE ALWAYS FELT I LIVED ON THE HIGH SEAS, THREATENED, AT THE HEART OF A ROYAL HAPPINESS.

THE BRICKLAYER’S LUNCH HOUR

TWO BRICKLAYERS ARE SETTING THE WALLS

OF A CELLAR IN A NEW DUG OUT PATCH

OF DIRT BEHIND AN OLD HOUSE OF WOOD

WITH BROWN GABLES GROWN OVER WITH IVY

ON A SHADY STREET IN DENVER. IT IS NOON

AND ONE OF THEM WANDERS OFF. THE YOUNG

SUBORDINATE BRICKLAYER SITS IDLY FOR

A FEW MINUTES AFTER EATING A SANDWICH

AND THROWING AWAY THE PAPER BAG. HE

HAS ON DUNGAREES AND IS BARE ABOVE

THE WAIST; HE HAS YELLOW HAIR AND WEARS

A SMUDGED BUT STILL BRIGHT RED CAP

ON HIS HEAD. HE SITS IDLY ON TOP

OF THE WALL ON A LADDER THAT IS LEANED

UP BETWEEN HIS SPREAD THIGHS, HIS HEAD

BENT DOWN, GAZING UNINTERESTEDLY AT

THE PAPER BAG ON THE GRASS. HE DRAWS

HIS HAND ACROSS HIS BREAST, AND THEN

SLOWLY RUBS HIS KNUCKLES ACROSS THE

SIDE OF HIS CHIN, AND ROCKS TO AND FRO

ON THE WALL. A SMALL CAT WALKS TO HIM

ALONG THE TOP OF THE WALL. HE PICKS

IT UP, TAKES OFF HIS CAP, AND PUTS IT

OVER THE KITTEN’S BODY FOR A MOMENT.

MEANWHILE IT IS DARKENING AS IF TO RAIN

AND THE WIND ON TOP OF THE TREES IN THE

STREET COMES THROUGH ALMOST HARSHLY.

DENVER, SUMMER 1947

THE TREMBLING OF THE VEIL

TODAY OUT THE WINDOW

THE TREES SEMED LIKE LIVE

ORGANISMS ON THE MOON.

EACH BOUGH EXTENDED UPWARD

COVERED AT THE NORTH END

WITH LEAVES, LIKE A GREEN

HAIRY PROTUBERANCE. I SAW

THE SCARLET-AND-PINK SHOOT-TIPS

OF BUDDING LEAVES WAVE

DELICATELY IN THE SUNLIGHT,

BLOWN BY THE BREEZE,

ALL THE ARMS OF THE TREES

BENDING AND STRAINING DOWNWARD

AT ONCE WHEN THE WIND

PUSHED THEM.

PATERSON, AUGUST 1948

THE SHROUDED STRANGER

BARE SKIN IS MY WRINKLED SACK

WHEN HOT APOLLO HUMPS MY BACK

WHEN JACK FROST GRABS ME IN THESE RAGS

I WRAP MY LEGS WITH BURLAP BAGS

MY FLESH IS CINDER MY FACE IS SNOW

I WALK THE RAILROAD TO AND FRO

WHEN THE CITY STREETS ARE BLACK AND DEAD

THE RAILROAD EMBANKMENT IS MY BED

I SUP MY SOUP FROM OLD TIN CANS

AND TAKE MY SWEETS FROM LITTLE HANDS

IN TIGER ALLEY NEAR THE JAIL

I STEAL AWAY FROM THE GARBAGE PAIL

IN DARKEST NIGHT WHERE NONE CAN SEE

DOWN IN THE BOWELS OF THE FACTORY

I SNEAK BAREFOOT UPON STONE

COME AND HEAR THE OLD MAN GROAN

I HIDE AND WAIT LIKE A NAKED CHILD

UNDER THE BRIDGE MY HEART GOES WILD

I SCREAM AT A FIRE ON THE RIVER BANK

I GIVE MY BODY TO AN OLD GAS TANK

I DREAM THAT I HAVE BURNING HAIR

BOILED ARMS THAT CLAW THE AIR

THE TORSO OF AN IRON KING

AND ON MY BACK A BROKEN WING

WHO’LL GO OUT WHORING INTO THE NIGHT

ON THE EYELESS ROAD IN THE SKINNY MOONLIGHT

MAID OR DOWD OR ATHLETE PROUD

MAY WANTON WITH ME IN THE SHROUD

WHO’LL COME LIE DOWN IN THE DARK WITH ME

BELLY TO BELLY AND KNEE TO KNEE

WHO’LL LOOK INTO MY HOODED EYE

WHO’LL LIE DOWN UNDER MY DARKENED THIGH?

NEW YORK, 1949-1951

THE GREEN AUTOMOBILE

IF I HAD A GREEN AUTOMOBILE

I’D GO FIND MY OLD COMPANION

IN HIS HOUSE ON THE WESTERN OCEAN.

HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!

I’D HONK MY HORN AT HIS MANLY GATE,

INSIDE HIS WIFE AND THREE

CHILDREN SPRAWL NAKED

ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR.

HE’D COME RUNNING OUT

TO MY CAR FULL OF HEROIC BEER

AND JUMP SCREAMING AT THE WHEEL

FOR HE IS THE GREATER DRIVER.

WE’D PILGRIMAGE TO THE HIGHEST MOUNT

OF OUR EARLIER ROCKY MOUNTAIN VISIONS

LAUGHING IN EACH OTHER’S ARMS,

DELIGHT SURPASSING THE HIGHEST ROCKIES,

AND AFTER OLD AGONY, DRUNK WITH NEW YEARS,

BOUNDING TOWARD THE SNOWY HORIZON

BLASTING THE DASHBOARD WITH ORIGINAL BOP

HOT ROD ON THE MOUNTAIN

WE’D BATTER UP THE CLOUDY HIGHWAY

WHERE ANGELS OF ANXIETY

CAREEN THROUGH THE TREES

AND SCREAM OUT OF THE ENGINE.

WE’D BURN ALL NIGHT ON THE JACKPINE PEAK

SEEN FROM DENVER IN THE SUMMER DARK,

FORESTLIKE UNNATURAL RADIANCE

ILLUMINATING THE MOUNTAINTOP:

CHILDHOOD YOUTHTIME AGE & ETERNITY

WOULD OPEN LIKE SWEET TREES

IN THE NIGHTS OF ANOTHER SPRING

AND DUMBFOUND US WITH LOVE,

FOR WE CAN SEE TOGETHER

THE BEAUTY OF SOULS

HIDDEN LIKE DIAMONDS

IN THE CLOCK OF THE WORLD,

LIKE CHINESE MAGICIANS CAN

CONFOUND THE IMMORTALS

WITH OUR INTELLECTUALITY

HIDDEN IN THE MIST,

IN THE GREEN AUTOMOBILE

WHICH I HAVE INVENTED

IMAGINED AND VISIONED

ON THE ROADS OF THE WORLD

MORE REAL THAN THE ENGINE

ON A TRACK IN THE DESERT

PURER THAN GREYHOUND AND

SWIFTER THAN PHYSICAL JETPLANE.

DENVER! DENVER! WE’LL RETURN

ROARING ACROSS THE CITY & COUNTY BUILDING LAWN

WHICH CATCHES THE PURE EMERALD FLAME

STREAMING IN THE WAKE OF OUR AUTO.

THIS TIME WE’LL BUY UP THE CITY!

I CASHED A GREAT CHECK IN MY SKULL BANK

TO FOUND A MIRACULOUS COLLEGE OF THE BODY

UP ON THE BUS TERMINAL ROOF.

BUT FIRST WE’LL DRIVE THE STATIONS OF DOWNTOWN,

POOLHALL FLOPHOUSE JAZZJOINT JAIL

WHOREHOUSE DOWN FOLSOM

TO THE DARKEST ALLEYS OF LARIMER

PAYING RESPECTS TO DENVER’S FATHER

LOST ON THE RAILROAD TRACKS,

STUPOR OF WINE AND SILENCE

HALLOWING THE SLUM OF HIS DECADES,

SALUTE HIM AND HIS SAINTLY SUITCASE

OF DARK MUSCATEL, DRINK

AND SMASH THE SWEET BOTTLES

ON DIESELS IN ALLEGIANCE.

THEN WE GO DRIVING DRUNK ON BOULEVARDS

WHERE ARMIES MARCH AND STILL PARADE

STAGGERING UNDER THE INVISIBLE

BANNER OF REALITY—

HURTLING THROUGH THE STREET

IN THE AUTO OF OUR FATE

WE SHARE AN ARCHANGELIC CIGARETTE

AND TELL EACH OTHER’S FORTUNES:

FAMES OF SUPERNATURAL ILLUMINATION,

BLEAK RAINY GAPS OF TIME,

GREAT ART LEARNED IN DESOLATION

AND WE BEAT APART AFTER SIX DECADES . . .

AND ON AN ASPHALT CROSSROAD,

DEAL WITH EACH OTHER IN PRINCELY

GENTLENESS ONCE MORE, RECALLING

FAMOUS DEAD TALKS OF OTHER CITIES.

THE WINDSHIELD’S FULL OF TEARS,

RAIN WETS OUR NAKED BREASTS,

WE KNEEL TOGETHER IN THE SHADE

AMID THE TRAFFIC OF NIGHT IN PARADISE

AND NOW RENEW THE SOLITARY VOW

WE MADE EACH OTHER TAKE

IN TEXAS, ONCE:

I CAN’T INSCRIBE HERE. . . .



HOW MANY SATURDAY NIGHTS WILL BE

MADE DRUNKEN BY THIS LEGEND?

HOW WILL YOUNG DENVER COME TO MOURN

HER FORGOTTEN SEXUAL ANGEL?

HOW MANY BOYS WILL STRIKE THE BLACK PIANO

IN IMITATION OF THE EXCESS OF A NATIVE SAINT?

OR GIRLS FALL WANTON UNDER HIS SPECTRE IN THE HIGH

SCHOOLS OF MELANCHOLY NIGHT?

WHILE ALL THE TIME IN ETERNITY

IN THE WAN LIGHT OF THIS POEM’S RADIO

WE’LL SIT BEHIND FORGOTTEN SHADES

HEARKENING THE LOST JAZZ OF ALL SATURDAYS.

NEAL, WE’LL BE REAL HEROES NOW

IN A WAR BETWEEN OUR COCKS AND TIME:

LET’S BE THE ANGELS OF THE WORLD’S DESIRE

AND TAKE THE WORLD TO BED WITH US BEFORE WE DIE.

SLEEPING ALONE, OR WITH COMPANION,

GIRL OR FAIRY SHEEP OR DREAM,

I’LL FAIL OF LACKLOVE, YOU, SATIETY:

ALL MEN FALL, OUR FATHERS FELL BEFORE,

BUT RESURRECTING THAT LOST FLESH

IS BUT A MOMENT’S WORK OF MIND:

AN AGELESS MONUMENT TO LOVE

IN THE IMAGINATION:

MEMORIAL BUILT OUT OF OUR OWN BODIES

CONSUMED BY THE INVISIBLE POEM—

WE’LL SHUDDER IN DENVER AND ENDURE

THOUGH BLOOD AND WRINKLES BLIND OUR EYES.

SO THIS GREEN AUTOMOBILE:

I GIVE YOU IN FLIGHT

A PRESENT, A PRESENT

FROM MY IMAGINATION.

WE WILL GO RIDING

OVER THE ROCKIES,

WE’LL GO ON RIDING

ALL NIGHT LONG UNTIL DAWN,

THEN BACK TO YOUR RAILROAD, THE SP

YOUR HOUSE AND YOUR CHILDREN

AND BROKEN LEG DESTINY

YOU’LL RIDE DOWN THE PLAINS

IN THE MORNING: AND BACK

TO MY VISIONS, MY OFFICE

AND EASTERN APARTMENT

I’LL RETURN TO NEW YORK.

NEW YORK, MAY 22–25, 1953

SONG

THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD

IS LOVE.

UNDER THE BURDEN

OF SOLITUDE,

UNDER THE BURDEN

OF DISSATISFACTION

THE WEIGHT,

THE WEIGHT WE CARRY

IS LOVE.

WHO CAN DENY?

IN DREAMS

IT TOUCHES

THE BODY,

IN THOUGHT

CONSTRUCTS

A MIRACLE,

IN IMAGINATION

ANGUISHES

TILL BORN

IN HUMAN—

LOOKS OUT OF THE HEART

BURNING WITH PURITY—

FOR THE BURDEN OF LIFE

IS LOVE,

BUT WE CARRY THE WEIGHT

WEARILY,

AND SO MUST REST

IN THE ARMS OF LOVE

AT LAST,

MUST REST IN THE ARMS

OF LOVE.

NO REST

WITHOUT LOVE,

NO SLEEP

WITHOUT DREAMS

OF LOVE—

BE MAD OR CHILL

OBSESSED WITH ANGELS

OR MACHINES,

THE FINAL WISH

IS LOVE

—CANNOT BE BITTER,

CANNOT DENY,

CANNOT WITHHOLD

IF DENIED:

THE WEIGHT IS TOO HEAVY

—MUST GIVE

FOR NO RETURN

AS THOUGHT

IS GIVEN

IN SOLITUDE

IN ALL THE EXCELLENCE

OF ITS EXCESS.

THE WARM BODIES

SHINE TOGETHER

IN THE DARKNESS,

THE HAND MOVES

TO THE CENTER

OF THE FLESH,

THE SKIN TREMBLES

IN HAPPINESS

AND THE SOUL COMES

JOYFUL TO THE EYE—

YES, YES,

THAT’S WHAT

I WANTED,

I ALWAYS WANTED,

I ALWAYS WANTED,

TO RETURN

TO THE BODY

WHERE I WAS BORN.

SAN JOSE, 1954

ON BURROUGHS’ WORK

THE METHOD MUST BE PUREST MEAT

AND NO SYMBOLIC DRESSING,

ACTUAL VISIONS & ACTUAL PRISONS

AS SEEN THEN AND NOW.

PRISONS AND VISIONS PRESENTED

WITH RARE DESCRIPTIONS

CORRESPONDING EXACTLY TO THOSE

OF ALCATRAZ AND ROSE.

A NAKED LUNCH IS NATURAL TO US,

WE EAT REALITY SANDWICHES.

BUT ALLEGORIES ARE SO MUCH LETTUCE.

DON’T HIDE THE MADNESS.

SAN FRANCISCO, 1955-1956

A SUPERMARKET IN CALIFORNIA

WHAT THOUGHTS I HAVE OF YOU TONIGHT, WALT WHITMAN, FOR I WALKED DOWN THE SIDESTREETS UNDER THE TREES WITH A HEADACHE SELF-CONSCIOUS LOOKING AT THE FULL MOON.

IN MY HUNGRY FATIGUE, AND SHOPPING FOR IMAGES, I WENT INTO THE NEON FRUIT SUPERMARKET, DREAMING OF YOUR ENUMERATIONS!

WHAT PEACHES AND WHAT PENUMBRAS! WHOLE FAMILIES SHOPPING AT NIGHT! AISLES FULL OF HUSBANDS! WIVES IN THE AVOCADOS, BABIES IN THE TOMATOES!—AND YOU, GARCÍA LORCA, WHAT WERE YOU DOING DOWN BY THE WATERMELONS?

I SAW YOU, WALT WHITMAN, CHILDLESS, LONELY OLD GRUBBER, POKING AMONG THE MEATS IN THE REFRIGERATOR AND EYEING THE GROCERY BOYS.

I HEARD YOU ASKING QUESTIONS OF EACH: WHO KILLED THE PORK CHOPS? WHAT PRICE BANANAS? ARE YOU MY ANGEL?

I WANDERED IN AND OUT OF THE BRILLIANT STACKS OF CANS FOLLOWING YOU, AND FOLLOWED IN MY IMAGINATION BY THE STORE DETECTIVE.

WE STRODE DOWN THE OPEN CORRIDORS TOGETHER IN OUR SOLITARY FANCY TASTING ARTICHOKES, POSSESSING EVERY FROZEN DELICACY, AND NEVER PASSING THE CASHIER.

WHERE ARE WE GOING, WALT WHITMAN? THE DOORS CLOSE IN AN HOUR. WHICH WAY DOES YOUR BEARD POINT TONIGHT?

(I TOUCH YOUR BOOK AND DREAM OF OUR ODYSSEY IN THE SUPERMARKET AND FEEL ABSURD.)

WILL WE WALK ALL NIGHT THROUGH SOLITARY STREETS? THE TREES ADD SHADE TO SHADE, LIGHTS OUT IN THE HOUSES, WE’LL BOTH BE LONELY.

WILL WE STROLL DREAMING OF THE LOST AMERICA OF LOVE PAST BLUE AUTOMOBILES IN DRIVEWAYS, HOME TO OUR SILENT COTTAGE?

AH, DEAR FATHER, GRAYBEARD, LONELY OLD COURAGE-TEACHER, WHAT AMERICA DID YOU HAVE WHEN CHARON QUIT POLING HIS FERRY AND YOU GOT OUT ON A SMOKING BANK AND STOOD WATCHING THE BOAT DISAPPEAR ON THE BLACK WATERS OF LETHE?

BERKELEY, 1955

SUNFLOWER SUTRA

I WALKED ON THE BANKS OF THE TINCAN BANANA DOCK AND SAT DOWN UNDER THE HUGE SHADE OF A SOUTHERN PACIFIC LOCOMOTIVE TO LOOK AT THE SUNSET OVER THE BOX HOUSE HILLS AND CRY.

JACK KEROUAC SAT BESIDE ME ON A BUSTED RUSTY IRON POLE, COMPANION, WE THOUGHT THE SAME THOUGHTS OF THE SOUL, BLEAK AND BLUE AND SAD-EYED, SURROUNDED BY THE GNARLED STEEL ROOTS OF TREES OF MACHINERY.

THE OILY WATER ON THE RIVER MIRRORED THE RED SKY, SUN SANK ON TOP OF FINAL FRISCO PEAKS, NO FISH IN THAT STREAM, NO HERMIT IN THOSE MOUNTS, JUST OURSELVES RHEUMY-EYED AND HUNG-OVER LIKE OLD BUMS ON THE RIVERBANK, TIRED AND WILY.

LOOK AT THE SUNFLOWER, HE SAID, THERE WAS A DEAD GRAY SHADOW AGAINST THE SKY, BIG AS A MAN, SITTING DRY ON TOP OF A PILE OF ANCIENT SAWDUST—

—I RUSHED UP ENCHANTED—IT WAS MY FIRST SUNFLOWER, MEMORIES OF BLAKE—MY VISIONS—HARLEM

AND HELLS OF THE EASTERN RIVERS, BRIDGES CLANKING JOES GREASY SANDWICHES, DEAD BABY CARRIAGES, BLACK TREADLESS TIRES FORGOTTEN AND UNRETREADED, THE POEM OF THE RIVERBANK, CONDOMS & POTS, STEEL KNIVES, NOTHING STAINLESS, ONLY THE DANK MUCK AND THE RAZOR-SHARP ARTIFACTS PASSING INTO THE PAST—

AND THE GRAY SUNFLOWER POISED AGAINST THE SUNSET, CRACKLY BLEAK AND DUSTY WITH THE SMUT AND SMOG AND SMOKE OF OLDEN LOCOMOTIVES IN ITS EYE—

COROLLA OF BLEARY SPIKES PUSHED DOWN AND BROKEN LIKE A BATTERED CROWN, SEEDS FALLEN OUT OF ITS FACE, SOON-TO-BE-TOOTHLESS MOUTH OF SUNNY AIR, SUNRAYS OBLITERATED ON ITS HAIRY HEAD LIKE A DRIED WIRE SPIDERWEB,

LEAVES STUCK OUT LIKE ARMS OUT OF THE STEM, GESTURES FROM THE SAWDUST ROOT, BROKE PIECES OF PLASTER FALLEN OUT OF THE BLACK TWIGS, A DEAD FLY IN ITS EAR,

UNHOLY BATTERED OLD THING YOU WERE, MY SUNFLOWER O MY SOUL, I LOVED YOU THEN!

THE GRIME WAS NO MAN’S GRIME BUT DEATH AND HUMAN LOCOMOTIVES,

ALL THAT DRESS OF DUST, THAT VEIL OF DARKENED RAILROAD SKIN, THAT SMOG OF CHEEK, THAT EYELID OF BLACK MIS’RY, THAT SOOTY HAND OR PHALLUS OR PROTUBERANCE OF ARTIFICIAL WORSE-THAN-DIRT—INDUSTRIAL—MODERN—ALL THAT CIVILIZATION SPOTTING YOUR CRAZY GOLDEN CROWN—

AND THOSE BLEAR THOUGHTS OF DEATH AND DUSTY LOVELESS EYES AND ENDS AND WITHERED ROOTS BELOW, IN THE HOME-PILE OF SAND AND SAWDUST, RUBBER DOLLAR BILLS, SKIN OF MACHINERY, THE GUTS AND INNARDS OF THE WEEPING COUGHING CAR, THE EMPTY LONELY TINCANS WITH THEIR RUSTY TONGUES ALACK, WHAT MORE COULD I NAME, THE SMOKED ASHES OF SOME COCK CIGAR, THE CUNTS OF WHEELBARROWS AND THE MILKY BREASTS OF CARS, WORNOUT ASSES OUT OF CHAIRS & SPHINCTERS OF DYNAMOS—ALL THESE

ENTANGLED IN YOUR MUMMIED ROOTS—AND YOU THERE STANDING BEFORE ME IN THE SUNSET, ALL YOUR GLORY IN YOUR FORM!

A PERFECT BEAUTY OF A SUNFLOWER! A PERFECT EXCELLENT LOVELY SUNFLOWER EXISTENCE! A SWEET NATURAL EYE TO THE NEW HIP MOON, WOKE UP ALIVE AND EXCITED GRASPING IN THE SUNSET SHADOW SUNRISE GOLDEN MONTHLY BREEZE!

HOW MANY FLIES BUZZED ROUND YOU INNOCENT OF YOUR GRIME, WHILE YOU CURSED THE HEAVENS OF THE RAILROAD AND YOUR FLOWER SOUL?

POOR DEAD FLOWER? WHEN DID YOU FORGET YOU WERE A FLOWER? WHEN DID YOU LOOK AT YOUR SKIN AND DECIDE YOU WERE AN IMPOTENT DIRTY OLD LOCOMOTIVE? THE GHOST OF A LOCOMOTIVE? THE SPECTER AND SHADE OF A ONCE POWERFUL MAD AMERICAN LOCOMOTIVE?

YOU WERE NEVER NO LOCOMOTIVE, SUNFLOWER, YOU WERE A SUNFLOWER!

AND YOU LOCOMOTIVE, YOU ARE A LOCOMOTIVE, FORGET ME NOT!

SO I GRABBED UP THE SKELETON THICK SUNFLOWER AND STUCK IT AT MY SIDE LIKE A SCEPTER,

AND DELIVER MY SERMON TO MY SOUL, AND JACK’S SOUL TOO, AND ANYONE WHO’LL LISTEN,

—WE’RE NOT OUR SKIN OF GRIME, WE’RE NOT OUR DREAD BLEAK DUSTY IMAGELESS LOCOMOTIVES, WE’RE ALL GOLDEN SUNFLOWERS INSIDE, BLESSED BY OUR OWN SEED & HAIRY NAKED ACCOMPLISHMENT-BODIES GROWING INTO MAD BLACK FORMAL SUNFLOWERS IN THE SUNSET, SPIED ON BY OUR OWN EYES UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE MAD LOCOMOTIVE RIVERBANK SUNSET FRISCO HILLY TINCAN EVENING SITDOWN VISION.

AMERICA

AMERICA I’VE GIVEN YOU ALL AND NOW I’M NOTHING.

AMERICA TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTYSEVEN CENTS JANUARY 17, 1956.

I CAN’T STAND MY OWN MIND.

AMERICA WHEN WILL WE END THE HUMAN WAR?

GO FUCK YOURSELF WITH YOUR ATOM BOMB.

I DON’T FEEL GOOD DON’T BOTHER ME.

I WON’T WRITE MY POEM TILL I’M IN MY RIGHT MIND.

AMERICA WHEN WILL YOU BE ANGELIC?

WHEN WILL YOU TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES?

WHEN WILL YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF THROUGH THE GRAVE?

WHEN WILL YOU BE WORTHY OF YOUR MILLION TROTSKYITES?

AMERICA WHY ARE YOUR LIBRARIES FULL OF TEARS?

AMERICA WHEN WILL YOU SEND YOUR EGGS TO INDIA?

I’M SICK OF YOUR INSANE DEMANDS.

WHEN CAN I GO INTO THE SUPERMARKET AND BUY WHAT I NEED WITH MY GOOD LOOKS?

AMERICA AFTER ALL IT IS YOU AND I WHO ARE PERFECT NOT THE NEXT WORLD.

YOUR MACHINERY IS TOO MUCH FOR ME.

YOU MADE ME WANT TO BE A SAINT.

THERE MUST BE SOME OTHER WAY TO SETTLE THIS ARGUMENT.

BURROUGHS IS IN TANGIERS I DON’T THINK HE’LL COME BACK IT’S SINISTER.

ARE YOU BEING SINISTER OR IS THIS SOME FORM OF PRACTICAL JOKE?

I’M TRYING TO COME TO THE POINT.

I REFUSE TO GIVE UP MY OBSESSION.

AMERICA STOP PUSHING I KNOW WHAT I’M DOING.

AMERICA THE PLUM BLOSSOMS ARE FALLING.

I HAVEN’T READ THE NEWSPAPERS FOR MONTHS, EVERYDAY SOMEBODY GOES ON TRIAL FOR MURDER.

AMERICA I FEEL SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE WOBBLIES.

AMERICA I USED TO BE A COMMUNIST WHEN I WAS A KID I’M NOT SORRY.

I SMOKE MARIJUANA EVERY CHANCE I GET.

I SIT IN MY HOUSE FOR DAYS ON END AND STARE AT THE ROSES IN THE CLOSET.

WHEN I GO TO CHINATOWN I GET DRUNK AND NEVER GET LAID.

MY MIND IS MADE UP THERE’S GOING TO BE TROUBLE.

YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME READING MARX.

MY PSYCHOANALYST THINKS I’M PERFECTLY RIGHT.

I WON’T SAY THE LORD’S PRAYER.

I HAVE MYSTICAL VISIONS AND COSMIC VIBRATIONS.

AMERICA I STILL HAVEN’T TOLD YOU WHAT YOU DID TO UNCLE MAX AFTER HE CAME OVER FROM RUSSIA.

I’M ADDRESSING YOU.

ARE YOU GOING TO LET YOUR EMOTIONAL LIFE BE RUN BY TIME MAGAZINE?

I’M OBSESSED BY TIME MAGAZINE.

I READ IT EVERY WEEK.

ITS COVER STARES AT ME EVERY TIME I SLINK PAST THE CORNER CANDYSTORE.

I READ IT IN THE BASEMENT OF THE BERKELEY PUBLIC LIBRARY.

IT’S ALWAYS TELLING ME ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. BUSINESSMEN ARE SERIOUS. MOVIE PRODUCERS ARE SERIOUS. EVERYBODY’S SERIOUS BUT ME.

IT OCCURS TO ME THAT I AM AMERICA.

I AM TALKING TO MYSELF AGAIN.

ASIA IS RISING AGAINST ME.

I HAVEN’T GOT A CHINAMAN’S CHANCE.

I’D BETTER CONSIDER MY NATIONAL RESOURCES.

MY NATIONAL RESOURCES CONSIST OF TWO JOINTS OF MARIJUANA MILLIONS OF GENITALS AN UNPUBLISHABLE PRIVATE LITERATURE THAT JETPLANES 1400 MILES AN HOUR AND TWENTY-FIVE-THOUSAND MENTAL INSTITUTIONS.

I SAY NOTHING ABOUT MY PRISONS NOR THE MILLIONS OF UNDERPRIVILEGED WHO LIVE IN MY FLOWERPOTS UNDER THE LIGHT OF FIVE HUNDRED SUNS.

I HAVE ABOLISHED THE WHOREHOUSES OF FRANCE, TANGIERS IS THE NEXT TO GO.

MY AMBITION IS TO BE PRESIDENT DESPITE THE FACT THAT I’M A CATHOLIC.

AMERICA HOW CAN I WRITE A HOLY LITANY IN YOUR SILLY MOOD?

I WILL CONTINUE LIKE HENRY FORD MY STROPHES ARE AS INDIVIDUAL AS HIS AUTOMOBILES MORE SO THEY’RE ALL DIFFERENT SEXES.

AMERICA I WILL SELL YOU STROPHES $2500 APIECE $500 DOWN ON YOUR OLD STROPHE

AMERICA FREE TOM MOONEY

AMERICA SAVE THE SPANISH LOYALISTS

AMERICA SACCO & VANZETTI MUST NOT DIE

AMERICA I AM THE SCOTTSBORO BOYS.

AMERICA WHEN I WAS SEVEN MOMMA TOOK ME TO COMMUNIST CELL MEETINGS THEY SOLD US GARBANZOS A HANDFUL PER TICKET A TICKET COSTS A NICKEL AND THE SPEECHES WERE FREE EVERYBODY WAS ANGELIC AND SENTIMENTAL ABOUT THE WORKERS IT WAS ALL SO SINCERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT A GOOD THING THE PARTY WAS IN 1835 SCOTT NEARING WAS A GRAND OLD MAN A REAL MENSCH MOTHER BLOOR THE SILK-STRIKERS’ EWIG-WEIBLICHE MADE ME CRY I ONCE SAW THE YIDDISH ORATOR ISREAL AMTER PLAIN. EVERYBODY MUST HAVE BEEN A SPY.

AMERICA YOU DON’T REALLY WANT TO GO TO WAR.

AMERICA IT’S THEM BAD RUSSIANS.

THEM RUSSIANS THEM RUSSIANS AND THEM CHINAMEN. AND THEM RUSSIANS.

THE RUSSIA WANTS TO EAT US ALIVE. THE RUSSIA’S POWER MAD. SHE WANTS TO TAKE OUR CARS FROM OUT OUR GARAGES.

HER WANTS TO GRAB CHICAGO. HER NEEDS A RED READER’S DIGEST. HER WANTS OUR AUTO PLANTS IN SIBERIA. HIM BIG BUREAUCRACY RUNNING OUR FILLINGSTATIONS.

THAT NO GOOD. UGH. HIM MAKE INDIANS LEARN READ. HIM NEED BIG BLACK NIGGERS. HAH. HER MAKE US ALL WORK SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY. HELP.

AMERICA THIS IS QUITE SERIOUS.

AMERICA THIS IS THE IMPRESSION I GET FROM LOOKING IN THE TELEVISION SET.

AMERICA IS THIS CORRECT?

I’D BETTER GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE JOB.

IT’S TRUE I DON’T WANT TO JOIN THE ARMY OR TURN LATHES IN PRECISION PARTS FACTORIES, I’M NEARSIGHTED AND PSYCHOPATHIC ANYWAY.

AMERICA I’M PUTTING MY QUEER SHOULDER TO THE WHEEL.

BERKELEY, JANUARY 17, 1956

KADDISH

FOR NAOMI GINSBERG, 1894–1956

I

STRANGE NOW TO THINK OF YOU, GONE WITHOUT CORSETS & EYES, WHILE I WALK ON THE SUNNY PAVEMENT OF GREENWICH VILLAGE.

DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN, CLEAR WINTER NOON, AND I’VE BEEN UP ALL NIGHT, TALKING, TALKING, READING THE KADDISH ALOUD, LISTENING TO RAY CHARLES BLUES SHOUT BLIND ON THE PHONOGRAPH

THE RHYTHM THE RHYTHM—AND YOUR MEMORY IN MY HEAD THREE YEARS AFTER—AND READ ADONAIS’ LAST TRIUMPHANT STANZAS ALOUD—WEPT, REALIZING HOW WE SUFFER—

AND HOW DEATH IS THAT REMEDY ALL SINGERS DREAM OF, SING, REMEMBER, PROPHESY AS IN THE HEBREW ANTHEM, OR THE BUDDHIST BOOK OF ANSWERS—AND MY OWN IMAGINATION OF A WITHERED LEAF—AT DAWN—

DREAMING BACK THRU LIFE, YOUR TIME—AND MINE ACCELERATING TOWARD APOCALYPSE,

THE FINAL MOMENT—THE FLOWER BURNING IN THE DAY—AND WHAT COMES AFTER,

LOOKING BACK ON THE MIND ITSELF THAT SAW AN AMERICAN CITY

A FLASH AWAY, AND THE GREAT DREAM OF ME OR CHINA, OR YOU AND A PHANTOM RUSSIA, OR A CRUMPLED BED THAT NEVER EXISTED—

LIKE A POEM IN THE DARK—ESCAPED BACK TO OBLIVION—

NO MORE TO SAY, AND NOTHING TO WEEP FOR BUT THE BEINGS IN THE DREAM, TRAPPED IN ITS DISAPPEARANCE,

SIGHING, SCREAMING WITH IT, BUYING AND SELLING PIECES OF PHANTOM, WORSHIPPING EACH OTHER,

WORSHIPPING THE GOD INCLUDED IN IT ALL—LONGING OR INEVITABILITY?—WHILE IT LASTS, A VISION—ANYTHING MORE?

IT LEAPS ABOUT ME, AS I GO OUT AND WALK THE STREET, LOOK BACK OVER MY SHOULDER, SEVENTH AVENUE, THE BATTLEMENTS OF WINDOW OFFICE BUILDINGS SHOULDERING EACH OTHER HIGH, UNDER A CLOUD, TALL AS THE SKY AN INSTANT—AND THE SKY ABOVE—AN OLD BLUE PLACE.

OR DOWN THE AVENUE TO THE SOUTH, TO—AS I WALK TOWARD THE LOWER EAST SIDE—WHERE YOU WALKED 50 YEARS AGO, LITTLE GIRL—FROM RUSSIA, EATING THE FIRST POISONOUS TOMATOES OF AMERICA—FRIGHTENED ON THE DOCK—

THEN STRUGGLING IN THE CROWDS OF ORCHARD STREET TOWARD WHAT?—TOWARD NEWARK—

TOWARD CANDY STORE, FIRST HOME-MADE SODAS OF THE CENTURY, HAND-CHURNED ICE CREAM IN BACKROOM ON MUSTY BROWNFLOOR BOARDS—

TOWARD EDUCATION MARRIAGE NERVOUS BREAKDOWN, OPERATION, TEACHING SCHOOL, AND LEARNING TO BE MAD, IN A DREAM—WHAT IS THIS LIFE?

TOWARD THE KEY IN THE WINDOW—AND THE GREAT KEY LAYS ITS HEAD OF LIGHT ON TOP OF MANHATTAN, AND OVER THE FLOOR, AND LAYS DOWN ON THE SIDEWALK—IN A SINGLE VAST BEAM, MOVING, AS I WALK DOWN FIRST TOWARD THE YIDDISH THEATER—AND THE PLACE OF POVERTY

YOU KNEW, AND I KNOW, BUT WITHOUT CARING NOW—STRANGE TO HAVE MOVED THRU PATERSON, AND THE WEST, AND EUROPE AND HERE AGAIN,

WITH THE CRIES OF SPANIARDS NOW IN THE DOORSTOOPS DOORS AND DARK BOYS ON THE STREET, FIRE ESCAPES OLD AS YOU

—THO YOU’RE NOT OLD NOW, THAT’S LEFT HERE WITH ME—

MYSELF, ANYHOW, MAYBE AS OLD AS THE UNIVERSE—AND I GUESS THAT DIES WITH US—ENOUGH TO CANCEL ALL THAT COMES—WHAT CAME IS GONE FOREVER EVERY TIME—

THAT’S GOOD! THAT LEAVES IT OPEN FOR NO REGRET—NO FEAR RADIATORS, LACKLOVE, TORTURE EVEN TOOTHACHE IN THE END—

THOUGH WHILE IT COMES IT IS A LION THAT EATS THE SOUL—AND THE LAMB, THE SOUL, IN US, ALAS, OFFERING ITSELF IN SACRIFICE TO CHANGE’S FIERCE HUNGER—HAIR AND TEETH—AND THE ROAR OF BONEPAIN, SKULL BARE, BREAK RIB, ROT-SKIN, BRAINTRICKED IMPLACABILITY.

AI! AI! WE DO WORSE! WE ARE IN A FIX! AND YOU’RE OUT, DEATH LET YOU OUT, DEATH HAD THE MERCY, YOU’RE DONE WITH YOUR CENTURY, DONE WITH GOD, DONE WITH THE PATH THRU IT—DONE WITH YOURSELF AT LAST—PURE—BACK TO THE BABE DARK BEFORE YOUR FATHER, BEFORE US ALL—BEFORE THE WORLD—

THERE, REST. NO MORE SUFFERING FOR YOU. I KNOW WHERE YOU’VE GONE, IT’S GOOD.

NO MORE FLOWERS IN THE SUMMER FIELDS OF NEW YORK, NO JOY NOW, NO MORE FEAR OF LOUIS,

AND NO MORE OF HIS SWEETNESS AND GLASSES, HIS HIGH SCHOOL DECADES, DEBTS, LOVES, FRIGHTENED TELEPHONE CALLS, CONCEPTION BEDS, RELATIVES, HANDS—

NO MORE OF SISTER ELANOR,—SHE GONE BEFORE YOU—WE KEPT IT SECRET—YOU KILLED HER—OR SHE KILLED HERSELF TO BEAR WITH YOU—AN ARTHRITIC HEART—BUT DEATH’S KILLED YOU BOTH—NO MATTER—

NOR YOUR MEMORY OF YOUR MOTHER, 1915 TEARS IN SILENT MOVIES WEEKS AND WEEKS—FORGETTING, AGGRIEVE WATCHING MARIE DRESSLER ADDRESS HUMANITY, CHAPLIN DANCE IN YOUTH,

OR BORIS GODUNOV, CHALIAPIN’S AT THE MET, HALLING HIS VOICE OF A WEEPING CZAR—BY STANDING ROOM WITH ELANOR & MAX—WATCHING ALSO THE CAPITALISTS TAKE SEATS IN ORCHESTRA, WHITE FURS, DIAMONDS,

WITH THE YPSL’S HITCH-HIKING THRU PENNSYLVANIA, IN BLACK BAGGY GYM SKIRTS PANTS, PHOTOGRAPH OF 4 GIRLS HOLDING EACH OTHER ROUND THE WASTE, AND LAUGHING EYE, TOO COY, VIRGINAL SOLITUDE OF 1920

ALL GIRLS GROWN OLD, OR DEAD, NOW, AND THAT LONG HAIR IN THE GRAVE—LUCKY TO HAVE HUSBANDS LATER—

YOU MADE IT—I CAME TOO—EUGENE MY BROTHER BEFORE (STILL GRIEVING NOW AND WILL GREAM ON TO HIS LAST STIFF HAND, AS HE GOES THRU HIS CANCER—OR KILL —LATER PERHAPS—SOON HE WILL THINK—)

AND IT’S THE LAST MOMENT I REMEMBER, WHICH I SEE THEM ALL, THRU MYSELF, NOW—THO NOT YOU

I DIDN’T FORESEE WHAT YOU FELT—WHAT MORE HIDEOUS GAPE OF BAD MOUTH CAME FIRST—TO YOU—AND WERE YOU PREPARED?

TO GO WHERE? IN THAT DARK—THAT—IN THAT GOD? A RADIANCE? A LORD IN THE VOID? LIKE AN EYE IN THE BLACK CLOUD IN A DREAM? ADONOI AT LAST, WITH YOU?

BEYOND MY REMEMBRANCE! INCAPABLE TO GUESS! NOT MERELY THE YELLOW SKULL IN THE GRAVE, OR A BOX OF WORM DUST, AND A STAINED RIBBON—DEATHS-HEAD WITH HALO? CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

IS IT ONLY THE SUN THAT SHINES ONCE FOR THE MIND, ONLY THE FLASH OF EXISTENCE, THAN NONE EVER WAS?

NOTHING BEYOND WHAT WE HAVE—WHAT YOU HAD—THAT SO PITIFUL—YET TRIUMPH,

TO HAVE BEEN HERE, AND CHANGED, LIKE A TREE, BROKEN, OR FLOWER—FED TO THE GROUND—BUT MAD, WITH ITS PETALS, COLORED, THINKING GREAT UNIVERSE, SHAKEN, CUT IN THE HEAD, LEAF STRIPT, HID IN AN EGG CRATE HOSPITAL, CLOTH WRAPPED, SORE—FREAKED IN THE MOON BRAIN, NAUGHTLESS.

NO FLOWER LIKE THAT FLOWER, WHICH KNEW ITSELF IN THE GARDEN, AND FOUGHT THE KNIFE—LOST

CUT DOWN BY AN IDIOT SNOWMAN’S ICY—EVEN IN THE SPRING—STRANGE GHOST THOUGHT—SOME DEATH—SHARP ICICLE IN HIS HAND—CROWNED WITH OLD ROSES—A DOG FOR HIS EYES—COCK OF A SWEATSHOP—HEART OF ELECTRIC IRONS.

ALL THE ACCUMULATIONS OF LIFE, THAT WEAR US OUT—CLOCKS, BODIES, CONSCIOUSNESS, SHOES, BREASTS—BEGOTTEN SONS—YOUR COMMUNISM—‘PARANOIA’ INTO HOSPITALS.

YOU ONCE KICKED ELANOR IN THE LEG, SHE DIED OF HEART FAILURE LATER. YOU OF STROKE. ASLEEP? WITHIN A YEAR, THE TWO OF YOU, SISTERS IN DEATH. IS ELANOR HAPPY?

MAX GRIEVES ALIVE IN AN OFFICE ON LOWER BROADWAY, LONE LARGE MUSTACHE OVER MIDNIGHT ACCOUNTINGS, NOT SURE. HIS LIFE PASSES—AS HE SEES—AND WHAT DOES HE DOUBT NOW? STILL DREAM OF MAKING MONEY, OR THAT MIGHT HAVE MADE MONEY, HIRED NURSE, HAD CHILDREN, FOUND EVEN YOUR IMMORTALITY, NAOMI?

I’LL SEE HIM SOON. NOW I’VE GOT TO CUT THROUGH—TO TALK TO YOU—AS I DIDN’T WHEN YOU HAD A MOUTH.

FOREVER. AND WE’RE BOUND FOR THAT, FOREVER—LIKE EMILY DICKINSON’S HORSES—HEADED TO THE END.

THEY KNOW THE WAY—THESE STEEDS—RUN FASTER THAN WE THINK—IT’S OUR OWN LIFE THEY CROSS—AND TAKE WITH THEM.

MAGNIFICENT, MOURNED NO MORE, MARRED OF HEART, MIND BEHIND, MARRIED DREAMED, MORTAL CHANGED—ASS AND FACE DONE WITH MURDER.

IN THE WORLD, GIVEN, FLOWER MADDENED, MADE NO UTOPIA, SHUT UNDER PINE, ALMED IN EARTH, BALMED IN LONE, JEHOVAH, ACCEPT.

NAMELESS, ONE FACED, FOREVER BEYOND ME, BEGINNINGLESS, ENDLESS, FATHER IN DEATH. THO I AM NOT THERE FOR THIS PROPHECY, I AM UNMARRIED, I’M HYMNLESS, I’M HEAVENLESS, HEADLESS IN BLISSHOOD I WOULD STILL ADORE

THEE, HEAVEN, AFTER DEATH, ONLY ONE BLESSED IN NOTHINGNESS, NOT LIGHT OR DARKNESS, DAYLESS ETERNITY—

TAKE THIS, THIS PSALM, FROM ME, BURST FROM MY HAND IN A DAY, SOME OF MY TIME, NOW GIVEN TO NOTHING—TO PRAISE THEE—BUT DEATH

THIS IS THE END, THE REDEMPTION FROM WILDERNESS, WAY FOR THE WONDERER, HOUSE SOUGHT FOR ALL, BLACK HANDKERCHIEF WASHED CLEAN BY WEEPING—PAGE BEYOND PSALM—LAST CHANGE OF MINE AND NAOMI—TO GOD’S PERFECT DARKNESS—DEATH, STAY THY PHANTOMS!

II

OVER AND OVER—REFRAIN—OF THE HOSPITALS—STILL HAVEN’T WRITTEN YOUR HISTORY—LEAVE IT ABSTRACT—A FEW IMAGES

RUN THRU THE MIND—LIKE THE SAXOPHONE CHORUS OF HOUSES AND YEARS—REMEMBRANCE OF ELECTRICAL SHOCKS.

BY LONG NITES AS A CHILD IN PATERSON APARTMENT, WATCHING OVER YOUR NERVOUSNESS—YOU WERE FAT—YOUR NEXT MOVE—

BY THAT AFTERNOON I STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL TO TAKE CARE OF YOU—ONCE AND FOR ALL—WHEN I VOWED FOREVER THAT ONCE MAN DISAGREED WITH MY OPINION OF THE COSMOS, I WAS LOST—

BY MY LATER BURDEN—VOW TO ILLUMINATE MANKIND—THIS IS RELEASE OF PARTICULARS—(MAD AS YOU)—(SANITY A TRICK OF AGREEMENT)—

BUT YOU STARED OUT THE WINDOW ON THE BROADWAY CHURCH CORNER, AND SPIED A MYSTICAL ASSASSIN FROM NEWARK,

SO PHONED THE DOCTOR—‘OK GO WAY FOR A REST’—SO I PUT ON MY COAT AND WALKED YOU DOWNSTREET—ON THE WAY A GRAMMARSCHOOL BOY SCREAMED, UNACCOUNTABLY—‘WHERE YOU GOIN LADY TO DEATH’? I SHUDDERED—

AND YOU COVERED YOUR NOSE WITH MOTHEATEN FUR COLLAR, GAS MASK AGAINST POISON SNEAKED INTO DOWNTOWN ATMOSPHERE, SPRAYED BY GRANDMA—

AND WAS THE DRIVER OF THE CHEESEBOX PUBLIC SERVICE BUS A MEMBER OF THE GANG? YOU SHUDDERED AT HIS FACE, I COULD HARDLY GET YOU ON—TO NEW YORK, VERY TIMES SQUARE, TO GRAB ANOTHER GREYHOUND—

WHERE WE HUNG AROUND 2 HOURS FIGHTING INVISIBLE BUGS AND JEWISH SICKNESS—BREEZE POISONED BY ROOSEVELT—

OUT TO GET YOU—AND ME TAGGING ALONG, HOPING IT WOULD END IN A QUIET ROOM IN A VICTORIAN HOUSE BY A LAKE.

RIDE 3 HOURS THRU TUNNELS PAST ALL AMERICAN INDUSTRY, BAYONNE PREPARING FOR WORLD WAR II, TANKS, GAS FIELDS, SODA FACTORIES, DINERS, LOCOMOTIVE ROUNDHOUSE FORTRESS—INTO PINEY WOODS NEW JERSEY INDIANS—CALM TOWNS—LONG ROADS THRU SANDY TREE FIELDS—

BRIDGES BY DEERLESS CREEKS, OLD WAMPUM LOADING THE STREAMBED—DOWN THERE A TOMAHAWK OR POCAHONTAS BONE—AND A MILLION OLD LADIES VOTING FOR ROOSEVELT IN BROWN SMALL HOUSES, ROADS OFF THE MADNESS HIGHWAY—

PERHAPS A HAWK IN A TREE, OR A HERMIT LOOKING FOR AN OWL-FILLED BRANCH—

ALL THE TIME ARGUING—AFRAID OF STRANGERS IN THE FORWARD DOUBLE SEAT, SNORING REGARDLESS—WHAT BUSRIDE THEY SNORE ON NOW?

‘ALLEN, YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND—IT’S—EVER SINCE THOSE 3 BIG STICKS UP MY BACK—THEY DID SOMETHING TO ME IN HOSPITAL, THEY POISONED ME, THEY WANT TO SEE ME DEAD—3 BIG STICKS, 3 BIG STICKS—

‘THE BITCH! OLD GRANDMA! LAST WEEK I SAW HER, DRESSED IN PANTS LIKE AN OLD MAN, WITH A SACK ON HER BACK, CLIMBING UP THE BRICK SIDE OF THE APARTMENT

‘ON THE FIRE ESCAPE, WITH POISON GERMS, TO THROW ON ME—AT NIGHT—MAYBE LOUIS IS HELPING HER—HE’S UNDER HER POWER—

‘I’M YOUR MOTHER, TAKE ME TO LAKEWOOD’ (NEAR WHERE GRAF ZEPPELIN HAD CRASHED BEFORE, ALL HITLER IN EXPLOSION) ‘WHERE I CAN HIDE.’

WE GOT THERE—DR. WHATZIS REST HOME—SHE HID BEHIND A CLOSET—DEMANDED A BLOOD TRANSFUSION.

WE WERE KICKED OUT—TRAMPING WITH VALISE TO UNKNOWN SHADY LAWN HOUSES—DUSK, PINE TREES AFTER DARK—LONG DEAD STREET FILLED WITH CRICKETS AND POISON IVY—

I SHUT HER UP BY NOW—BIG HOUSE REST HOME ROOMS—GAVE THE LANDLADY HER MONEY FOR THE WEEK—CARRIED UP THE IRON VALISE—SAT ON BED WAITING TO ESCAPE—

NEAT ROOM IN ATTIC WITH FRIENDLY BEDCOVER—LACE CURTAINS—SPINNING WHEEL RUG—STAINED WALLPAPER OLD AS NAOMI. WE WERE HOME.

I LEFT ON THE NEXT BUS TO NEW YORK—LAID MY HEAD BACK IN THE LAST SEAT, DEPRESSED—THE WORST YET TO COME?—ABANDONING HER, RODE IN TORPOR—I WAS ONLY 12.

WOULD SHE HIDE IN HER ROOM AND COME OUT CHEERFUL FOR BREAKFAST? OR LOCK HER DOOR AND STARE THRU THE WINDOW FOR SIDESTREET SPIES? LISTEN AT KEYHOLES FOR HITLERIAN INVISIBLE GAS? DREAM IN A CHAIR—OR MOCK ME, BY—IN FRONT OF A MIRROR, ALONE?

12 RIDING THE BUS AT NITE THRU NEW JERSEY, HAVE LEFT NAOMI TO PARCAE IN LAKEWOOD’S HAUNTED HOUSE—LEFT TO MY OWN FATE BUS—SUNK IN A SEAT—ALL VIOLINS BROKEN—MY HEART SORE IN MY RIBS—MIND WAS EMPTY—WOULD SHE WERE SAFE IN HER COFFIN—

OR BACK AT NORMAL SCHOOL IN NEWARK, STUDYING UP ON AMERICA IN A BLACK SKIRT—WINTER ON THE STREET WITHOUT LUNCH—A PENNY A PICKLE—HOME AT NIGHT TO TAKE CARE OF ELANOR IN THE BEDROOM—

FIRST NERVOUS BREAKDOWN WAS 1919—SHE STAYED HOME FROM SCHOOL AND LAY IN A DARK ROOM FOR THREE WEEKS—SOMETHING BAD—NEVER SAID WHAT—EVERY NOISE HURT—DREAMS OF THE CREAKS OF WALL STREET—

BEFORE THE GRAY DEPRESSION—WENT UPSTATE NEW YORK—RECOVERED—LOU TOOK PHOTO OF HER SITTING CROSSLEG ON THE GRASS—HER LONG HAIR WOUND WITH FLOWERS—SMILING—PLAYING LULLABIES ON MANDOLIN—POISON IVY SMOKE IN LEFT-WING SUMMER CAMPS AND ME IN INFANCY SAW TREES—

OR BACK TEACHING SCHOOL, LAUGHING WITH IDIOTS, THE BACKWARD CLASSES—HER RUSSIAN SPECIALTY—MORONS WITH DREAMY LIPS, GREAT EYES, THIN FEET & SICKY FINGERS, SWAYBACKED, RACHITIC—

GREAT HEADS PENDULOUS OVER ALICE IN WONDERLAND, A BLACKBOARD FULL OF C A T.

NAOMI READING PATIENTLY, STORY OUT OF A COMMUNIST FAIRY BOOK—TALE OF THE SUDDEN SWEETNESS OF THE DICTATOR—FORGIVENESS OF WARLOCKS—ARMIES KISSING—

DEATHSHEADS AROUND THE GREEN TABLE—THE KING & THE WORKERS—PATERSON PRESS PRINTED THEM UP IN THE ’30S TILL SHE WENT MAD, OR THEY FOLDED, BOTH.

O PATERSON! I GOT HOME LATE THAT NITE. LOUIS WAS WORRIED. HOW COULD I BE SO—DIDN’T I THINK? I SHOULDN’T HAVE LEFT HER. MAD IN LAKEWOOD. CALL THE DOCTOR. PHONE THE HOME IN THE PINES. TOO LATE.

WENT TO BED EXHAUSTED, WANTING TO LEAVE THE WORLD (PROBABLY THAT YEAR NEWLY IN LOVE WITH R——MY HIGH SCHOOL MIND HERO, JEWISH BOY WHO CAME A DOCTOR LATER—THEN SILENT NEAT KID—

I LATER LAYING DOWN LIFE FOR HIM, MOVED TO MANHATTAN—FOLLOWED HIM TO COLLEGE—PRAYED ON FERRY TO HELP MANKIND IF ADMITTED—VOWED, THE DAY I JOURNEYED TO ENTRANCE EXAM—

BY BEING HONEST REVOLUTIONARY LABOR LAWYER—WOULD TRAIN FOR THAT—INSPIRED BY SACCO VANZETTI, NORMAN THOMAS, DEBS, ALTGELD, SANDBURG, POE—LITTLE BLUE BOOKS. I WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT, OR SENATOR.

IGNORANT WOE—LATER DREAMS OF KNEELING BY R’S SHOCKED KNEES DECLARING MY LOVE OF 1941—WHAT SWEETNESS HE’D HAVE SHOWN ME, THO, THAT I’D WISHED HIM & DESPAIRED—FIRST LOVE—A CRUSH—

LATER A MORTAL AVALANCHE, WHOLE MOUNTAINS OF HOMOSEXUALITY, MATTERHORNS OF COCK, GRAND CANYONS OF ASSHOLE—WEIGHT ON MY MELANCHOLY HEAD—

MEANWHILE I WALKED ON BROADWAY IMAGINING INFINITY LIKE A RUBBER BALL WITHOUT SPACE BEYOND—WHAT’S OUTSIDE?—COMING HOME TO GRAHAM AVENUE STILL MELANCHOLY PASSING THE LONE GREEN HEDGES ACROSS THE STREET, DREAMING AFTER THE MOVIES—)

THE TELEPHONE RANG AT 2 A.M.—EMERGENCY—SHE’D GONE MAD—NAOMI HIDING UNDER THE BED SCREAMING BUGS OF MUSSOLINI—HELP! LOUIS! BUBA! FASCISTS! DEATH!—THE LANDLADY FRIGHTENED—OLD FAG ATTENDANT SCREAMING BACK AT HER—

TERROR, THAT WOKE THE NEIGHBORS—OLD LADIES ON THE SECOND FLOOR RECOVERING FROM MENOPAUSE—ALL THOSE RAGS BETWEEN THIGHS, CLEAN SHEETS, SORRY OVER LOST BABIES—HUSBANDS ASHEN—CHILDREN SNEERING AT YALE, OR PUTTING OIL IN HAIR AT CCNY—OR TREMBLING IN MONTCLAIR STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE LIKE EUGENE—

HER BIG LEG CROUCHED TO HER BREAST, HAND OUTSTRETCHED KEEP AWAY, WOOL DRESS ON HER THIGHS, FUR COAT DRAGGED UNDER THE BED—SHE BARRICADED HERSELF UNDER BEDSPRING WITH SUITCASES.

LOUIS IN PAJAMAS LISTENING TO PHONE, FRIGHTENED—DO NOW?—WHO COULD KNOW?—MY FAULT, DELIVERING HER TO SOLITUDE?—SITTING IN THE DARK ROOM ON THE SOFA, TREMBLING, TO FIGURE OUT—

HE TOOK THE MORNING TRAIN TO LAKEWOOD, NAOMI STILL UNDER BED—THOUGHT HE BROUGHT POISON COPS—NAOMI SCREAMING—LOUIS WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HEART THEN? HAVE YOU BEEN KILLED BY NAOMI’S ECSTASY?

DRAGGED HER OUT, AROUND THE CORNER, A CAB, FORCED HER IN WITH VALISE, BUT THE DRIVER LEFT THEM OFF AT DRUGSTORE. BUS STOP, TWO HOURS’ WAIT.

I LAY IN BED NERVOUS IN THE 4-ROOM APARTMENT, THE BIG BED IN LIVING ROOM, NEXT TO LOUIS’ DESK—SHAKING—HE CAME HOME THAT NITE, LATE, TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.

NAOMI AT THE PRESCRIPTION COUNTER DEFENDING HERSELF FROM THE ENEMY—RACKS OF CHILDREN’S BOOKS, DOUCHE BAGS, ASPIRINS, POTS, BLOOD—‘DON’T COME NEAR ME—MURDERERS! KEEP AWAY! PROMISE NOT TO KILL ME!’

LOUIS IN HORROR AT THE SODA FOUNTAIN—WITH LAKEWOOD GIRLSCOUTS—COKE ADDICTS—NURSES—BUSMEN HUNG ON SCHEDULE—POLICE FROM COUNTRY PRECINCT, DUMBED—AND A PRIEST DREAMING OF PIGS ON AN ANCIENT CLIFF?

SMELLING THE AIR—LOUIS POINTING TO EMPTINESS?—CUSTOMERS VOMITING THEIR COKES—OR STARING—LOUIS HUMILIATED—NAOMI TRIUMPHANT —THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PLOT. BUS ARRIVES, THE DRIVERS WON’T HAVE THEM ON TRIP TO NEW YORK.

PHONECALLS TO DR. WHATZIS, ‘SHE NEEDS A REST,’ THE MENTAL HOSPITAL—STATE GREYSTONE DOCTORS—‘BRING HER HERE, MR. GINSBERG.’

NAOMI, NAOMI—SWEATING, BULGE-EYED, FAT, THE DRESS UNBUTTONED AT ONE SIDE—HAIR OVER BROW, HER STOCKING HANGING EVILLY ON HER LEGS—SCREAMING FOR A BLOOD TRANSFUSION—ONE RIGHTEOUS HAND UPRAISED—A SHOE IN IT—BAREFOOT IN THE PHARMACY—

THE ENEMIES APPROACH—WHAT POISONS? TAPE RECORDERS? FBI? ZHDANOV HIDING BEHIND THE COUNTER? TROTSKY MIXING RAT BACTERIA IN THE BACK OF THE STORE? UNCLE SAM IN NEWARK, PLOTTING DEATHLY PERFUMES IN THE NEGRO DISTRICT? UNCLE EPHRAIM, DRUNK WITH MURDER IN THE POLITICIAN’S BAR, SCHEMING OF HAGUE? AUNT ROSE PASSING WATER THRU THE NEEDLES OF THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR?

TILL THE HIRED $35 AMBULANCE CAME FROM RED BANK——GRABBED HER ARMS—STRAPPED HER ON THE STRETCHER—MOANING, POISONED BY IMAGINARIES, VOMITING CHEMICALS THRU JERSEY, BEGGING MERCY FROM ESSEX COUNTY TO MORRISTOWN—

AND BACK TO GREYSTONE WHERE SHE LAY THREE YEARS—THAT WAS THE LAST BREAKTHROUGH, DELIVERED HER TO MADHOUSE AGAIN—

ON WHAT WARDS—I WALKED THERE LATER, OFT—OLD CATATONIC LADIES, GRAY AS CLOUD OR ASH OR WALLS—SIT CROONING OVER FLOORSPACE—CHAIRS—AND THE WRINKLED HAGS ACREEP, ACCUSING—BEGGING MY 13-YEAR-OLD MERCY—

‘TAKE ME HOME’—I WENT ALONE SOMETIMES LOOKING FOR THE LOST NAOMI, TAKING SHOCK—AND I’D SAY, ‘NO, YOU’RE CRAZY MAMA,—TRUST THE DRS.’—

AND EUGENE, MY BROTHER, HER ELDER SON, AWAY STUDYING LAW IN A FURNISHED ROOM IN NEWARK—

CAME PATERSON-WARD NEXT DAY—AND HE SAT ON THE BROKEN-DOWN COUCH IN THE LIVING ROOM—‘WE HAD TO SEND HER BACK TO GREYSTONE’—

—HIS FACE PERPLEXED, SO YOUNG, THEN EYES WITH TEARS—THEN CREPT WEEPING ALL OVER HIS FACE—‘WHAT FOR?’ WAIL VIBRATING IN HIS CHEEKBONES, EYES CLOSED UP, HIGH VOICE—EUGENE’S FACE OF PAIN.

HIM FARAWAY, ESCAPED TO AN ELEVATOR IN THE NEWARK LIBRARY, HIS BOTTLE DAILY MILK ON WINDOWSILL OF $5 WEEK FURN ROOM DOWNTOWN AT TROLLEY TRACKS—

HE WORKED 8 HRS. A DAY FOR $20/WK—THRU LAW SCHOOL YEARS—STAYED BY HIMSELF INNOCENT NEAR NEGRO WHOREHOUSES.

UNLAID, POOR VIRGIN—WRITING POEMS ABOUT IDEALS AND POLITICS LETTERS TO THE EDITOR PAT EVE NEWS—(WE BOTH WROTE, DENOUNCING SENATOR BORAH AND ISOLATIONISTS—AND FELT MYSTERIOUS TOWARD PATERSON CITY HALL—

I SNEAKED INSIDE IT ONCE—LOCAL MOLOCH TOWER WITH PHALLUS SPIRE & CAP O’ ORNAMENT, STRANGE GOTHIC POETRY THAT STOOD ON MARKET STREET—REPLICA LYONS’ HOTEL DE VILLE—

WHERE THE EVANGELIST PREACHED MADLY FOR 3 DECADES, HARD-HAIRED, CRACKED & TRUE TO HIS MEAN BIBLE—CHALKED PREPARE TO MEET THY GOD ON CIVIC PAVE—

OR GOD IS LOVE ON THE RAILROAD OVERPASS CONCRETE—HE RAVED LIKE I WOULD RAVE, THE LONE EVANGELIST—DEATH ON CITY HALL—)

BUT GENE, YOUNG,—BEEN MONTCLAIR TEACHERS COLLEGE 4 YEARS—TAUGHT HALF YEAR & QUIT TO GO AHEAD IN LIFE—AFRAID OF DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS—DARK SEX ITALIAN STUDENTS, RAW GIRLS GETTING LAID, NO ENGLISH, SONNETS DISREGARDED—AND HE DID NOT KNOW MUCH—JUST THAT HE LOST—

SO BROKE HIS LIFE IN TWO AND PAID FOR LAW—READ HUGE BLUE BOOKS AND RODE THE ANCIENT ELEVATOR 13 MILES AWAY IN NEWARK & STUDIED UP HARD FOR THE FUTURE

JUST FOUND THE SCREAM OF NAOMI ON HIS FAILURE DOORSTEP, FOR THE FINAL TIME, NAOMI GONE, US LONELY—HOME—HIM SITTING THERE—

THEN HAVE SOME CHICKEN SOUP, EUGENE. THE MAN OF EVANGEL WAILS IN FRONT OF CITY HALL. AND THIS YEAR LOU HAS POETIC LOVES OF SUBURB MIDDLE AGE—IN SECRET—MUSIC FROM HIS 1937 BOOK—SINCERE—HE LONGS FOR BEAUTY—

NO LOVE SINCE NAOMI SCREAMED—SINCE 1923?—NOW LOST IN GREYSTONE WARD—NEW SHOCK FOR HER—ELECTRICITY, FOLLOWING THE 40 INSULIN.

AND METRAZOL HAD MADE HER FAT.

SO THAT A FEW YEARS LATER SHE CAME HOME AGAIN—WE’D MUCH ADVANCED AND PLANNED—I WAITED FOR THAT DAY—MY MOTHER AGAIN TO COOK &—PLAY THE PIANO—SING AT MANDOLIN—LUNG STEW, & STENKA RAZIN, & THE COMMUNIST LINE ON THE WAR WITH FINLAND—AND LOUIS IN DEBT—SUSPECTED TO BE POISONED MONEY—MYSTERIOUS CAPITALISMS

—& WALKED DOWN THE LONG FRONT HALL & LOOKED AT THE FURNITURE. SHE NEVER REMEMBERED IT ALL. SOME AMNESIA. EXAMINED THE DOILIES—AND THE DINING ROOM SET WAS SOLD—

THE MAHOGANY TABLE—20 YEARS LOVE—GONE TO THE JUNK MAN—WE STILL HAD THE PIANO—AND THE BOOK OF POE—AND THE MANDOLIN, THO NEEDED SOME STRING, DUSTY—

SHE WENT TO THE BACKROOM TO LIE DOWN IN BED AND RUMINATE, OR NAP, HIDE—I WENT IN WITH HER, NOT LEAVE HER BY HERSELF—LAY IN BED NEXT TO HER—SHADES PULLED, DUSKY, LATE AFTERNOON—LOUIS IN FRONT ROOM AT DESK, WAITING—PERHAPS BOILING CHICKEN FOR SUPPER—

‘DON’T BE AFRAID OF ME BECAUSE I’M JUST COMING BACK HOME FROM THE MENTAL HOSPITAL—I’M YOUR MOTHER—’

POOR LOVE, LOST—A FEAR—I LAY THERE—SAID, ‘I LOVE YOU NAOMI,’—STIFF, NEXT TO HER ARM. I WOULD HAVE CRIED, WAS THIS THE COMFORTLESS LONE UNION?—NERVOUS, AND SHE GOT UP SOON.

WAS SHE EVER SATISFIED? AND—BY HERSELF SAT ON THE NEW COUCH BY THE FRONT WINDOWS, UNEASY—CHEEK LEANING ON HER HAND—NARROWING EYE—AT WHAT FATE THAT DAY—

PICKING HER TOOTH WITH HER NAIL, LIPS FORMED AN O, SUSPICION—THOUGHT’S OLD WORN VAGINA—ABSENT SIDEGLANCE OF EYE—SOME EVIL DEBT WRITTEN IN THE WALL, UNPAID—& THE AGED BREASTS OF NEWARK COME NEAR—

MAY HAVE HEARD RADIO GOSSIP THRU THE WIRES IN HER HEAD, CONTROLLED BY 3 BIG STICKS LEFT IN HER BACK BY GANGSTERS IN AMNESIA, THRU THE HOSPITAL—CAUSED PAIN BETWEEN HER SHOULDERS—

INTO HER HEAD—ROOSEVELT SHOULD KNOW HER CASE, SHE TOLD ME—AFRAID TO KILL HER, NOW, THAT THE GOVERNMENT KNEW THEIR NAMES—TRACED BACK TO HITLER—WANTED TO LEAVE LOUIS’ HOUSE FOREVER.

ONE NIGHT, SUDDEN ATTACK—HER NOISE IN THE BATHROOM—LIKE CROAKING UP HER SOUL—CONVULSIONS AND RED VOMIT COMING OUT OF HER MOUTH—DIARRHEA WATER EXPLODING FROM HER BEHIND—ON ALL FOURS IN FRONT OF THE TOILET—URINE RUNNING BETWEEN HER LEGS—LEFT RETCHING ON THE TILE FLOOR SMEARED WITH HER BLACK FECES—UNFAINTED—

AT FORTY, VARICOSED, NUDE, FAT, DOOMED, HIDING OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT DOOR NEAR THE ELEVATOR CALLING POLICE, YELLING FOR HER GIRLFRIEND ROSE TO HELP—

ONCE LOCKED HERSELF IN WITH RAZOR OR IODINE—COULD HEAR HER COUGH IN TEARS AT SINK—LOU BROKE THROUGH GLASS GREEN-PAINTED DOOR, WE PULLED HER OUT TO THE BEDROOM.

THEN QUIET FOR MONTHS THAT WINTER—WALKS, ALONE, NEARBY ON BROADWAY, READ DAILY WORKER—BROKE HER ARM, FELL ON ICY STREET—

BEGAN TO SCHEME ESCAPE FROM COSMIC FINANCIAL MURDER PLOTS—LATER SHE RAN AWAY TO THE BRONX TO HER SISTER ELANOR. AND THERE’S ANOTHER SAGA OF LATE NAOMI IN NEW YORK.

OR THRU ELANOR OR THE WORKMEN’S CIRCLE, WHERE SHE WORKED, ADDRESSING ENVELOPES, SHE MADE OUT—WENT SHOPPING FOR CAMPBELL’S TOMATO SOUP—SAVED MONEY LOUIS MAILED HER—

LATER SHE FOUND A BOYFRIEND, AND HE WAS A DOCTOR—DR. ISAAC WORKED FOR NATIONAL MARITIME UNION—NOW ITALIAN BALD AND PUDGY OLD DOLL—WHO WAS HIMSELF AN ORPHAN—BUT THEY KICKED HIM OUT—OLD CRUELTIES—

SLOPPIER, SAT AROUND ON BED OR CHAIR, IN CORSET DREAMING TO HERSELF—‘I’M HOT—I’M GETTING FAT—I USED TO HAVE SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FIGURE BEFORE I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL—YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME IN WOODBINE—’ THIS IN A FURNISHED ROOM AROUND THE NMU HALL, 1943.

LOOKING AT NAKED BABY PICTURES IN THE MAGAZINE—BABY POWDER ADVERTISEMENTS, STRAINED LAMB CARROTS—‘I WILL THINK NOTHING BUT BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS.’

REVOLVING HER HEAD ROUND AND ROUND ON HER NECK AT WINDOW LIGHT IN SUMMERTIME, IN HYPNOTIZE, IN DOVEN-DREAM RECALL—

‘I TOUCH HIS CHEEK, I TOUCH HIS CHEEK, HE TOUCHES MY LIPS WITH HIS HAND, I THINK BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS, THE BABY HAS A BEAUTIFUL HAND.’—

OR A NO-SHAKE OF HER BODY, DISGUST—SOME THOUGHT OF BUCHENWALD—SOME INSULIN PASSES THRU HER HEAD—A GRIMACE NERVE SHUDDER AT INVOLUNTARY (AS SHUDDER WHEN I PISS)—BAD CHEMICAL IN HER CORTEX—‘NO DON’T THINK OF THAT. HE’S A RAT.’

NAOMI: ‘AND WHEN WE DIE WE BECOME AN ONION, A CABBAGE, A CARROT, OR A SQUASH, A VEGETABLE.’ I COME DOWNTOWN FROM COLUMBIA AND AGREE. SHE READS THE BIBLE, THINKS BEAUTIFUL THOUGHTS ALL DAY.

‘YESTERDAY I SAW GOD. WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE? WELL, IN THE AFTERNOON I CLIMBED UP A LADDER—HE HAS A CHEAP CABIN IN THE COUNTRY, LIKE MONROE, N.Y. THE CHICKEN FARMS IN THE WOOD. HE WAS A LONELY OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD.

‘I COOKED SUPPER FOR HIM. I MADE HIM A NICE SUPPER—LENTIL SOUP, VEGETABLES, BREAD & BUTTER—MILTZ—HE SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE AND ATE, HE WAS SAD.

‘I TOLD HIM, LOOK AT ALL THOSE FIGHTINGS AND KILLINGS DOWN THERE, WHAT’S THE MATTER? WHY DON’T YOU PUT A STOP TO IT?

‘I TRY, HE SAID—THAT’S ALL HE COULD DO, HE LOOKED TIRED. HE’S A BACHELOR SO LONG, AND HE LIKES LENTIL SOUP.’

SERVING ME MEANWHILE, A PLATE OF COLD FISH—CHOPPED RAW CABBAGE DRIPT WITH TAPWATER—SMELLY TOMATOES—WEEK-OLD HEALTH FOOD—GRATED BEETS & CARROTS WITH LEAKY JUICE, WARM—MORE AND MORE DISCONSOLATE FOOD—I CAN’T EAT IT FOR NAUSEA SOMETIMES—THE CHARITY OF HER HANDS STINKING WITH MANHATTAN, MADNESS, DESIRE TO PLEASE ME, COLD UNDER COOKED FISH—PALE RED NEAR THE BONES. HER SMELLS—AND OFT NAKED IN THE ROOM, SO THAT I STARE AHEAD, OR TURN A BOOK IGNORING HER.

ONE TIME I THOUGHT SHE WAS TRYING TO MAKE ME COME LAY HER—FLIRTING TO HERSELF AT SINK—LAY BACK ON HUGE BED THAT FILLED MOST OF THE ROOM, DRESS UP ROUND HER HIPS, BIG SLASH OF HAIR, SCARS OF OPERATIONS, PANCREAS, BELLY WOUNDS, ABORTIONS, APPENDIX, STITCHING OF INCISIONS PULLING DOWN IN THE FAT LIKE HIDEOUS THICK ZIPPERS—RAGGED LONG LIPS BETWEEN HER LEGS—WHAT, EVEN, SMELL OF ASSHOLE? I WAS COLD—LATER REVOLTED A LITTLE, NOT MUCH—SEEMED PERHAPS A GOOD IDEA TO TRY—KNOW THE MONSTER OF THE BEGINNING WOMB—PERHAPS—THAT WAY. WOULD SHE CARE? SHE NEEDS A LOVER.

YISBORACH, V’YISTABACH, V’YISPOAR, V’YISROMAN, V’YISNASEH, V’YISHADOR, V’YISHALLEH, V’YISHALLOL, SH’MEH D’KUDSHO, B’RICH HU.

AND LOUIS REESTABLISHING HIMSELF IN PATERSON GRIMY APARTMENT IN NEGRO DISTRICT—LIVING IN DARK ROOMS—BUT FOUND HIMSELF A GIRL HE LATER MARRIED, FALLING IN LOVE AGAIN—THO SERE & SHY—HURT WITH 20 YEARS NAOMI’S MAD IDEALISM.

ONCE I CAME HOME, AFTER LONGTIME IN N.Y., HE’S LONELY—SITTING IN THE BEDROOM, HE AT DESK CHAIR TURNED ROUND TO FACE ME—WEEPS, TEARS IN RED EYES UNDER HIS GLASSES—

THAT WE’D LEFT HIM—GENE GONE STRANGELY INTO ARMY—SHE OUT ON HER OWN IN N.Y., ALMOST CHILDISH IN HER FURNISHED ROOM. SO LOUIS WALKED DOWNTOWN TO POSTOFFICE TO GET MAIL, TAUGHT IN HIGHSCHOOL—STAYED AT POETRY DESK, FORLORN—ATE GRIEF AT BICKFORD’S ALL THESE YEARS—ARE GONE.

EUGENE GOT OUT OF THE ARMY, CAME HOME CHANGED AND LONE—CUT OFF HIS NOSE IN JEWISH OPERATION—FOR YEARS STOPPED GIRLS ON BROADWAY FOR CUPS OF COFFEE TO GET LAID—WENT TO NYU, SERIOUS THERE, TO FINISH LAW.—

AND GENE LIVED WITH HER, ATE NAKED FISHCAKES, CHEAP, WHILE SHE GOT CRAZIER—HE GOT THIN, OR FELT HELPLESS, NAOMI STRIKING 1920 POSES AT THE MOON, HALF-NAKED IN THE NEXT BED.

BIT HIS NAILS AND STUDIED—WAS THE WEIRD NURSE-SON—NEXT YEAR HE MOVED TO A ROOM NEAR COLUMBIA—THOUGH SHE WANTED TO LIVE WITH HER CHILDREN—

‘LISTEN TO YOUR MOTHER’S PLEA, I BEG YOU’—LOUIS STILL SENDING HER CHECKS—I WAS IN BUGHOUSE THAT YEAR 8 MONTHS—MY OWN VISIONS UNMENTIONED IN THIS HERE LAMENT—

BUT THEN WENT HALF MAD—HITLER IN HER ROOM, SHE SAW HIS MUSTACHE IN THE SINK—AFRAID OF DR. ISAAC NOW, SUSPECTING THAT HE WAS IN ON THE NEWARK PLOT—WENT UP TO BRONX TO LIVE NEAR ELANOR’S RHEUMATIC HEART—

AND UNCLE MAX NEVER GOT UP BEFORE NOON, THO NAOMI AT 6 A.M. WAS LISTENING TO THE RADIO FOR SPIES—OR SEARCHING THE WINDOWSILL,

FOR IN THE EMPTY LOT DOWNSTAIRS, AN OLD MAN CREEPS WITH HIS BAG STUFFING PACKAGES OF GARBAGE IN HIS HANGING BLACK OVERCOAT.

MAX’S SISTER EDIE WORKS—17 YEARS BOOKKEEPER AT GIMBELS—LIVED DOWNSTAIRS IN APARTMENT HOUSE, DIVORCED—SO EDIE TOOK IN NAOMI ON ROCHAMBEAU AVE—

WOODLAWN CEMETERY ACROSS THE STREET, VAST DALE OF GRAVES WHERE POE ONCE—LAST STOP ON BRONX SUBWAY—LOTS OF COMMUNISTS IN THAT AREA.

WHO ENROLLED FOR PAINTING CLASSES AT NIGHT IN BRONX ADULT HIGH SCHOOL—WALKED ALONE UNDER VAN CORTLANDT ELEVATED LINE TO CLASS—PAINTS NAOMIISMS—

HUMANS SITTING ON THE GRASS IN SOME CAMP NO-WORRY SUMMERS YORE—SAINTS WITH DROOPY FACES AND LONG-ILL-FITTING PANTS, FROM HOSPITAL—

BRIDES IN FRONT OF LOWER EAST SIDE WITH SHORT GROOMS—LOST EL TRAINS RUNNING OVER THE BABYLONIAN APARTMENT ROOFTOPS IN THE BRONX—

SAD PAINTINGS—BUT SHE EXPRESSED HERSELF. HER MANDOLIN GONE, ALL STRINGS BROKE IN HER HEAD, SHE TRIED. TOWARD BEAUTY? OR SOME OLD LIFE MESSAGE?

BUT STARTED KICKING ELANOR, AND ELANOR HAD HEART TROUBLE—CAME UPSTAIRS AND ASKED HER ABOUT SPYDOM FOR HOURS,—ELANOR FRAZZLED. MAX AWAY AT OFFICE, ACCOUNTING FOR CIGAR STORES TILL AT NIGHT.

‘I AM A GREAT WOMAN—AM TRULY A BEAUTIFUL SOUL—AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY (HITLER, GRANDMA, HEARST, THE CAPITALISTS, FRANCO, DAILY NEWS, THE ’20S, MUSSOLINI, THE LIVING DEAD) WANT TO SHUT ME UP—BUBA’S THE HEAD OF A SPIDER NETWORK—’

KICKING THE GIRLS, EDIE & ELANOR—WOKE EDIE AT MIDNITE TO TELL HER SHE WAS A SPY AND ELANOR A RAT. EDIE WORKED ALL DAY AND COULDN’T TAKE IT—SHE WAS ORGANIZING THE UNION.—AND ELANOR BEGAN DYING, UPSTAIRS IN BED.

THE RELATIVES CALL ME UP, SHE’S GETTING WORSE—I WAS THE ONLY ONE LEFT —WENT ON THE SUBWAY WITH EUGENE TO SEE HER, ATE STALE FISH—

‘MY SISTER WHISPERS IN THE RADIO—LOUIS MUST BE IN THE APARTMENT—HIS MOTHER TELLS HIM WHAT TO SAY—LIARS!—I COOKED FOR MY TWO CHILDREN—I PLAYED THE MANDOLIN—’

LAST NIGHT THE NIGHTINGALE WOKE ME / LAST NIGHT WHEN ALL WAS STILL / IT SANG IN THE GOLDEN MOONLIGHT / FROM ON THE WINTRY HILL. SHE DID.

I PUSHED HER AGAINST THE DOOR AND SHOUTED ‘DON’T KICK ELANOR!’—SHE STARED AT ME—CONTEMPT—DIE—DISBELIEF HER SONS ARE SO NAIVE, SO DUMB—‘ELANOR IS THE WORST SPY! SHE’S TAKING ORDERS!’

‘—NO WIRES IN THE ROOM!’—I’M YELLING AT HER—LAST DITCH, EUGENE LISTENING ON THE BED—WHAT CAN HE DO TO ESCAPE THAT FATAL MAMA—‘YOU’VE BEEN AWAY FROM LOUIS YEARS ALREADY—GRANDMA’S TOO OLD TO WALK—’

WE’RE ALL ALIVE AT ONCE THEN—EVEN ME & GENE & NAOMI IN ONE MYTHOLOGICAL COUSINESQUE ROOM—SCREAMING AT EACH OTHER IN THE FOREVER—I IN COLUMBIA JACKET, SHE HALF UNDRESSED.

I BANGING AGAINST HER HEAD WHICH SAW RADIOS, STICKS, HITLERS—THE GAMUT OF HALLUCINATIONS—FOR REAL—HER OWN UNIVERSE—NO ROAD THAT GOES ELSEWHERE—TO MY OWN—NO AMERICA, NOT EVEN A WORLD—

THAT YOU GO AS ALL MEN, AS VAN GOGH, AS MAD HANNAH, ALL THE SAME—TO THE LAST DOOM—THUNDER, SPIRITS, LIGHTNING!

I’VE SEEN YOUR GRAVE! O STRANGE NAOMI! MY OWN—CRACKED GRAVE! SHEMA Y’ISRAEL—I AM SVUL AVRUM—YOU—IN DEATH?

YOUR LAST NIGHT IN THE DARKNESS OF THE BRONX—I PHONECALLED—THRU HOSPITAL TO SECRET POLICE

THAT CAME, WHEN YOU AND I WERE ALONE, SHRIEKING AT ELANOR IN MY EAR—WHO BREATHED HARD IN HER OWN BED, GOT THIN—

NOR WILL FORGET, THE DOORKNOCK, AT YOUR FRIGHT OF SPIES,—LAW ADVANCING, ON MY HONOR—ETERNITY ENTERING THE ROOM—YOU RUNNING TO THE BATHROOM UNDRESSED, HIDING IN PROTEST FROM THE LAST HEROIC FATE—

STARING AT MY EYES, BETRAYED—THE FINAL COPS OF MADNESS RESCUING ME—FROM YOUR FOOT AGAINST THE BROKEN HEART OF ELANOR,

YOUR VOICE AT EDIE WEARY OF GIMBELS COMING HOME TO BROKEN RADIO—AND LOUIS NEEDING A POOR DIVORCE, HE WANTS TO GET MARRIED SOON—EUGENE DREAMING, HIDING AT 125 ST., SUING NEGROES FOR MONEY ON CRUD FURNITURE, DEFENDING BLACK GIRLS—

PROTESTS FROM THE BATHROOM—SAID YOU WERE SANE—DRESSING IN A COTTON ROBE, YOUR SHOES, THEN NEW, YOUR PURSE AND NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS—NO—YOUR HONESTY—

AS YOU VAINLY MADE YOUR LIPS MORE REAL WITH LIPSTICK, LOOKING IN THE MIRROR TO SEE IF THE INSANITY WAS ME OR A CARFUL OF POLICE.

OR GRANDMA SPYING AT 78—YOUR VISION—HER CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS OF THE CEMETERY WITH POLITICAL KIDNAPPER’S BAG—OR WHAT YOU SAW ON THE WALLS OF THE BRONX, IN PINK NIGHTGOWN AT MIDNIGHT, STARING OUT THE WINDOW ON THE EMPTY LOT—

AH ROCHAMBEAU AVE.—PLAYGROUND OF PHANTOMS—LAST APARTMENT IN THE BRONX FOR SPIES—LAST HOME FOR ELANOR OR NAOMI, HERE THESE COMMUNIST SISTERS LOST THEIR REVOLUTION—

‘ALL RIGHT—PUT ON YOUR COAT MRS.—LET’S GO—WE HAVE THE WAGON DOWNSTAIRS—YOU WANT TO COME WITH HER TO THE STATION?’

THE RIDE THEN—HELD NAOMI’S HAND, AND HELD HER HEAD TO MY BREAST, I’M TALLER—KISSED HER AND SAID I DID IT FOR THE BEST—ELANOR SICK—AND MAX WITH HEART CONDITION—NEEDS—

TO ME—‘WHY DID YOU DO THIS?’—‘YES MRS., YOUR SON WILL HAVE TO LEAVE YOU IN AN HOUR’—THE AMBULANCE

CAME IN A FEW HOURS—DROVE OFF AT 4 A.M. TO SOME BELLEVUE IN THE NIGHT DOWNTOWN—GONE TO THE HOSPITAL FOREVER. I SAW HER LED AWAY—SHE WAVED, TEARS IN HER EYES.

TWO YEARS, AFTER A TRIP TO MEXICO—BLEAK IN THE FLAT PLAIN NEAR BRENTWOOD, SCRUB BRUSH AND GRASS AROUND THE UNUSED RR TRAIN TRACK TO THE CRAZYHOUSE—

NEW BRICK 20 STORY CENTRAL BUILDING—LOST ON THE VAST LAWNS OF MAD-TOWN ON LONG ISLAND—HUGE CITIES OF THE MOON.

ASYLUM SPREADS OUT GIANT WINGS ABOVE THE PATH TO A MINUTE BLACK HOLE—THE DOOR—ENTRANCE THRU CROTCH—

I WENT IN—SMELT FUNNY—THE HALLS AGAIN—UP ELEVATOR—TO A GLASS DOOR ON A WOMEN’S WARD—TO NAOMI—TWO NURSES BUXOM WHITE—THEY LED HER OUT, NAOMI STARED—AND I GASPT—SHE’D HAD A STROKE—

TOO THIN, SHRUNK ON HER BONES—AGE COME TO NAOMI—NOW BROKEN INTO WHITE HAIR—LOOSE DRESS ON HER SKELETON—FACE SUNK, OLD! WITHERED—CHEEK OF CRONE—

ONE HAND STIFF—HEAVINESS OF FORTIES & MENOPAUSE REDUCED BY ONE HEART STROKE, LAME NOW—WRINKLES—A SCAR ON HER HEAD, THE LOBOTOMY—RUIN, THE HAND DIPPING DOWNWARDS TO DEATH—

O RUSSIAN FACED, WOMAN ON THE GRASS, YOUR LONG BLACK HAIR IS CROWNED WITH FLOWERS, THE MANDOLIN IS ON YOUR KNEES—

COMMUNIST BEAUTY, SIT HERE MARRIED IN THE SUMMER AMONG DAISIES, PROMISED HAPPINESS AT HAND—

HOLY MOTHER, NOW YOU SMILE ON YOUR LOVE, YOUR WORLD IS BORN ANEW, CHILDREN RUN NAKED IN THE FIELD SPOTTED WITH DANDELIONS,

THEY EAT IN THE PLUM TREE GROVE AT THE END OF THE MEADOW AND FIND A CABIN WHERE A WHITE-HAIRED NEGRO TEACHES THE MYSTERY OF HIS RAINBARREL—

BLESSED DAUGHTER COME TO AMERICA, I LONG TO HEAR YOUR VOICE AGAIN, REMEMBERING YOUR MOTHER’S MUSIC, IN THE SONG OF THE NATURAL FRONT—

O GLORIOUS MUSE THAT BORE ME FROM THE WOMB, GAVE SUCK FIRST MYSTIC LIFE & TAUGHT ME TALK AND MUSIC, FROM WHOSE PAINED HEAD I FIRST TOOK VISION—

TORTURED AND BEATEN IN THE SKULL—WHAT MAD HALLUCINATIONS OF THE DAMNED THAT DRIVE ME OUT OF MY OWN SKULL TO SEEK ETERNITY TILL I FIND PEACE FOR THEE, O POETRY—AND FOR ALL HUMANKIND CALL ON THE ORIGIN

DEATH WHICH IS THE MOTHER OF THE UNIVERSE!—NOW WEAR YOUR NAKEDNESS FOREVER, WHITE FLOWERS IN YOUR HAIR, YOUR MARRIAGE SEALED BEHIND THE SKY—NO REVOLUTION MIGHT DESTROY THAT MAIDENHOOD—

O BEAUTIFUL GARBO OF MY KARMA—ALL PHOTOGRAPHS FROM 1920 IN CAMP NICHT-GEDEIGET HERE UNCHANGED—WITH ALL THE TEACHERS FROM NEWARK—NOR ELANOR BE GONE, NOR MAX AWAIT HIS SPECTER—NOR LOUIS RETIRE FROM THIS HIGH SCHOOL—

BACK! YOU! NAOMI! SKULL ON YOU! GAUNT IMMORTALITY AND REVOLUTION COME—SMALL BROKEN WOMAN—THE ASHEN INDOOR EYES OF HOSPITALS, WARD GRAYNESS ON SKIN—

‘ARE YOU A SPY?’ I SAT AT THE SOUR TABLE, EYES FILLING WITH TEARS—‘WHO ARE YOU? DID LOUIS SEND YOU?—THE WIRES—’

IN HER HAIR, AS SHE BEAT ON HER HEAD—‘I’M NOT A BAD GIRL—DON’T MURDER ME!—I HEAR THE CEILING—I RAISED TWO CHILDREN—’

TWO YEARS SINCE I’D BEEN THERE—I STARTED TO CRY—SHE STARED—NURSE BROKE UP THE MEETING A MOMENT—I WENT INTO THE BATHROOM TO HIDE, AGAINST THE TOILET WHITE WALLS

‘THE HORROR’ I WEEPING—TO SEE HER AGAIN—‘THE HORROR’—AS IF SHE WERE DEAD THRU FUNERAL ROT IN—‘THE HORROR!’

I CAME BACK SHE YELLED MORE—THEY LED HER AWAY—‘YOU’RE NOT ALLEN—’ I WATCHED HER FACE—BUT SHE PASSED BY ME, NOT LOOKING—

OPENED THE DOOR TO THE WARD,—SHE WENT THRU WITHOUT A GLANCE BACK, QUIET SUDDENLY—I STARED OUT—SHE LOOKED OLD—THE VERGE OF THE GRAVE—‘ALL THE HORROR!’

ANOTHER YEAR, I LEFT N.Y.—ON WEST COAST IN BERKELEY COTTAGE DREAMED OF HER SOUL—THAT, THRU LIFE, IN WHAT FORM IT STOOD IN THAT BODY, ASHEN OR MANIC, GONE BEYOND JOY—

NEAR ITS DEATH—WITH EYES—WAS MY OWN LOVE IN ITS FORM, THE NAOMI, MY MOTHER ON EARTH STILL—SENT HER LONG LETTER—& WROTE HYMNS TO THE MAD—WORK OF THE MERCIFUL LORD OF POETRY.

THAT CAUSES THE BROKEN GRASS TO BE GREEN, OR THE ROCK TO BREAK IN GRASS—OR THE SUN TO BE CONSTANT TO EARTH—SUN OF ALL SUNFLOWERS AND DAYS ON BRIGHT IRON BRIDGES—WHAT SHINES ON OLD HOSPITALS—AS ON MY YARD—

RETURNING FROM SAN FRANCISCO ONE NIGHT, ORLOVSKY IN MY ROOM—WHALEN IN HIS PEACEFUL CHAIR—A TELEGRAM FROM GENE, NAOMI DEAD—

OUTSIDE I BENT MY HEAD TO THE GROUND UNDER THE BUSHES NEAR THE GARAGE—KNEW SHE WAS BETTER—

AT LAST—NOT LEFT TO LOOK ON EARTH ALONE—2 YEARS OF SOLITUDE—NO ONE, AT AGE NEARING 60—OLD WOMAN OF SKULLS—ONCE LONG-TRESSED NAOMI OF BIBLE—

OR RUTH WHO WEPT IN AMERICA—REBECCA AGED IN NEWARK—DAVID REMEMBERING HIS HARP, NOW LAWYER AT YALE

OR SVUL AVRUM—ISRAEL ABRAHAM—MYSELF—TO SING IN THE WILDERNESS TOWARD GOD—O ELOHIM!—SO TO THE END—2 DAYS AFTER HER DEATH I GOT HER LETTER—

STRANGE PROPHECIES ANEW! SHE WROTE—‘THE KEY IS IN THE WINDOW, THE KEY IS IN THE SUNLIGHT AT THE WINDOW—I HAVE THE KEY—GET MARRIED ALLEN DON’T TAKE DRUGS—THE KEY IS IN THE BARS, IN THE SUNLIGHT IN THE WINDOW.

LOVE,

YOUR MOTHER’

ONLY TO HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE BEGINNING IN WHICH SHE DRANK CHEAP SODAS IN THE MORGUES OF NEWARK,

ONLY TO HAVE SEEN HER WEEPING ON GRAY TABLES IN LONG WARDS OF HER UNIVERSE

ONLY TO HAVE KNOWN THE WEIRD IDEAS OF HITLER AT THE DOOR, THE WIRES IN HER HEAD, THE THREE BIG STICKS

RAMMED DOWN HER BACK, THE VOICES IN THE CEILING SHRIEKING OUT HER UGLY EARLY LAYS FOR 30 YEARS,

ONLY TO HAVE SEEN THE TIME-JUMPS, MEMORY LAPSE, THE CRASH OF WARS, THE ROAR AND SILENCE OF A VAST ELECTRIC SHOCK,

ONLY TO HAVE SEEN HER PAINTING CRUDE PICTURES OF ELEVATEDS RUNNING OVER THE ROOFTOPS OF THE BRONX

HER BROTHERS DEAD IN RIVERSIDE OR RUSSIA, HER LONE IN LONG ISLAND WRITING A LAST LETTER—AND HER IMAGE IN THE SUNLIGHT AT THE WINDOW

‘THE KEY IS IN THE SUNLIGHT AT THE WINDOW IN THE BARS THE KEY IS IN THE SUNLIGHT,’

ONLY TO HAVE COME TO THAT DARK NIGHT ON IRON BED BY STROKE WHEN THE SUN GONE DOWN ON LONG ISLAND

AND THE VAST ATLANTIC ROARS OUTSIDE THE GREAT CALL OF BEING TO ITS OWN

TO COME BACK OUT OF THE NIGHTMARE—DIVIDED CREATION—WITH HER HEAD LAIN ON A PILLOW OF THE HOSPITAL TO DIE

—IN ONE LAST GLIMPSE—ALL EARTH ONE EVERLASTING LIGHT IN THE FAMILIAR BLACKOUT—NO TEARS FOR THIS VISION—

BUT THAT THE KEY SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND—AT THE WINDOW—THE KEY IN THE SUNLIGHT—TO THE LIVING—THAT CAN TAKE

THAT SLICE OF LIGHT IN HAND—AND TURN THE DOOR—AND LOOK BACK SEE

CREATION GLISTENING BACKWARDS TO THE SAME GRAVE, SIZE OF UNIVERSE,

SIZE OF THE TICK OF THE HOSPITAL’S CLOCK ON THE ARCHWAY OVER THE WHITE DOOR—

HEART IN THE OLD BED OF

MY SKIN     FROM THIS SINGLE

BIRTH REBORN THAT I AM

TO BE SO—

MY OWN IDENTITY NOW NAMELESS

NEITHER MAN NOR DRAGON OR

GOD

BUT THE DREAMING ME FULL

OF PHYSICAL RAYS’ TENDER

RED MOONS IN MY BELLY &

STARS IN MY EYES CIRCLING

AND THE SUN THE SUN THE

SUN MY VISIBLE FATHER

MAKING MY BODY VISIBLE

THRU MY EYES!

TOKYO, JULY 18, 1963

KRAL MAJALES

AND THE COMMUNISTS HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER BUT FAT CHEEKS AND EYEGLASSES AND LYING POLICEMEN

AND THE CAPITALISTS PROFFER NAPALM AND MONEY IN GREEN SUITCASES TO THE NAKED,

AND THE COMMUNISTS CREATE HEAVY INDUSTRY BUT THE HEART IS ALSO HEAVY

AND THE BEAUTIFUL ENGINEERS ARE ALL DEAD, THE SECRET TECHNICIANS CONSPIRE FOR THEIR OWN GLAMOUR

IN THE FUTURE, IN THE FUTURE, BUT NOW DRINK VODKA AND LAMENT THE SECURITY FORCES,

AND THE CAPITALISTS DRINK GIN AND WHISKEY ON AIRPLANES BUT LET INDIAN BROWN MILLIONS STARVE

AND WHEN COMMUNIST AND CAPITALIST ASSHOLES TANGLE THE JUST MAN IS ARRESTED OR ROBBED OR HAD HIS HEAD CUT OFF,

BUT NOT LIKE KABIR, AND THE CIGARETTE COUGH OF THE JUST MAN ABOVE THE CLOUDS

IN THE BRIGHT SUNSHINE IS A SALUTE TO THE HEALTH OF THE BLUE SKY.

FOR I WAS ARRESTED THRICE IN PRAGUE, ONCE FOR SINGING DRUNK ON NARODNI STREET,

ONCE KNOCKED DOWN ON THE MIDNIGHT PAVEMENT BY A MUSTACHED AGENT WHO SCREAMED OUT BOUZERANT,

ONCE FOR LOSING MY NOTEBOOKS OF UNUSUAL SEX POLITICS DREAM OPINIONS,

AND I WAS SENT FROM HAVANA BY PLANE BY DETECTIVES IN GREEN UNIFORM,

AND I WAS SENT FROM PRAGUE BY PLANE BY DETECTIVES IN CZECHOSLOVAKIAN BUSINESS SUITS,

CARDPLAYERS OUT OF CÉZANNE, THE TWO STRANGE DOLLS THAT ENTERED JOSEPH K’S ROOM AT MORN

ALSO ENTERED MINE, AND ATE AT MY TABLE, AND EXAMINED MY SCRIBBLES,

AND FOLLOWED ME NIGHT AND MORN FROM THE HOUSES OF LOVERS TO THE CAFÉS OF CENTRUM—

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, WHICH IS THE POWER OF SEXUAL YOUTH,

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, WHICH IS INDUSTRY IN ELOQUENCE AND ACTION IN AMOUR,

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, WHICH IS LONG HAIR OF ADAM AND THE BEARD OF MY OWN BODY

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, WHICH IS KRAL MAJALES IN THE CZECHOSLOVAKIAN TONGUE,

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, WHICH IS OLD HUMAN POESY, AND 100,000 PEOPLE CHOSE MY NAME,

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, AND IN A FEW MINUTES I WILL LAND AT LONDON AIRPORT,

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, NATURALLY, FOR I AM OF SLAVIC PARENTAGE AND A BUDDHIST JEW

WHO WORSHIPS THE SACRED HEART OF CHRIST THE BLUE BODY OF KRISHNA THE STRAIGHT BACK OF RAM

THE BEADS OF CHANGO THE NIGERIAN SINGING SHIVA SHIVA IN A MANNER WHICH I HAVE INVENTED

AND THE KING OF MAY IS A MIDDLEEUROPEAN HONOR, MINE IN THE XX CENTURY

DESPITE SPACE SHIPS AND THE TIME MACHINE, BECAUSE I HEARD THE VOICE OF BLAKE IN A VISION,

AND REPEAT THAT VOICE. AND I AM KING OF MAY THAT SLEEPS WITH TEENAGERS LAUGHING.

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, THAT I MAY BE EXPELLED FROM MY KINGDOM WITH HONOR, AS OF OLD,

TO SHOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CAESAR’S KINGDOM AND THE KINGDOM OF THE MAY OF MAN—

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, THO’ PARANOID, FOR THE KINGDOM OF MAY IS TOO BEAUTIFUL TO LAST FOR MORE THAN A MONTH—

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY BECAUSE I TOUCHED MY FINGER TO MY FOREHEAD SALUTING

A LUMINOUS HEAVY GIRL TREMBLING HANDS WHO SAID “ONE MOMENT MR. GINSBERG”

BEFORE A FAT YOUNG PLAINCLOTHESMAN STEPPED BETWEEN OUR BODIES—I WAS GOING TO ENGLAND—

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, RETURNING TO SEE BUNHILL FIELDS AND WALK ON HAMPSTEAD HEATH,

AND I AM THE KING OF MAY, IN A GIANT JETPLANE TOUCHING ALBION’S AIRFIELD TREMBLING IN FEAR

AS THE PLANE ROARS TO A LANDING ON THE GRAY CONCRETE, SHAKES & EXPELS AIR,

AND ROLLS SLOWLY TO A STOP UNDER THE CLOUDS WITH PART OF BLUE HEAVEN STILL VISIBLE.

AND THO’ I AM THE KING OF MAY, THE MARXISTS HAVE BEAT ME UPON THE STREET, KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT IN POLICE STATION, FOLLOWED ME THRU SPRINGTIME PRAGUE, DETAINED ME IN SECRET AND DEPORTED ME FROM OUR KINGDOM BY AIRPLANE.

THUS I HAVE WRITTEN THIS POEM ON A JET SEAT IN MID HEAVEN.

THAT BORROWS LIGHT FROM YOUR CIGARETTE,

GREETS THE BEARDED STRANGER OF TELEPHONES—

OCTOBER 22–29, 1969

THREE IN THE MORNING, I REALIZE THIS SECOND, THEN THIS ONE, THEN THE NEXT: I DRAW UP THE BALANCE SHEET FOR EACH MINUTE. AND WHY ALL THIS? BECAUSE I WAS BORN. IT IS A SPECIAL TYPE OF SLEEPLESSNESS THAT PRODUCES THE INDICTMENT OF BIRTH.



“EVER SINCE I WAS BORN”—THAT SINCE HAS A RESONANCE SO DREADFUL TO MY EARS IT BECOMES UNENDURABLE.



THERE IS A KIND OF KNOWLEDGE THAT STRIPS WHATEVER YOU DO OF WEIGHT AND SCOPE: FOR SUCH KNOWLEDGE, EVERYTHING IS WITHOUT BASIS EXCEPT ITSELF. PURE TO THE POINT OF ABHORRING EVEN THE NOTION OF AN OBJECT, IT TRANSLATES THAT EXTREME SCIENCE ACCORDING TO WHICH DOING OR NOT DOING SOMETHING COMES DOWN TO THE SAME THING AND IS ACCOMPANIED BY AN EQUALLY EXTREME SATISFACTION: THAT OF BEING ABLE TO REHEARSE, EACH TIME, THE DISCOVERY THAT ANY GESTURE PERFORMED IS NOT WORTH DEFENDING, THAT NOTHING IS ENHANCED BY THE MEREST VESTIGE OF SUBSTANCE, THAT “REALITY” FALLS WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF LUNACY. SUCH KNOWLEDGE DESERVES TO BE CALLED POSTHUMOUS: IT FUNCTIONS AS IF THE KNOWER WERE ALIVE AND NOT ALIVE, A BEING AND THE MEMORY OF A BEING. “IT’S ALREADY IN THE PAST,” HE SAYS ABOUT ALL HE ACHIEVES, EVEN AS HE ACHIEVES IT, THEREBY FOREVER DESTITUTE OF THE PRESENT

UNMAKING, DECREATING, IS THE ONLY TASK MAN MAY TAKE UPON HIMSELF, IF HE ASPIRES, AS EVERYTHING SUGGESTS, TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF FROM THE CREATOR.



I KNOW THAT MY BIRTH IS FORTUITOUS, A LAUGHABLE ACCIDENT, AND YET, AS SOON AS I FORGET MYSELF, I BEHAVE AS IF IT WERE A CAPITAL EVENT, INDISPENSABLE TO THE PROGRESS AND EQUILIBRIUM OF THE WORLD.



TO HAVE COMMITTED EVERY CRIME BUT THAT OF BEING A FATHER.



AS A GENERAL RULE, MEN EXPECT DISAPPOINTMENT: THEY KNOW THEY MUST NOT BE IMPATIENT, THAT IT WILL COME SOONER OR LATER, THAT IT WILL HOLD OFF LONG ENOUGH FOR THEM TO PROCEED WITH THEIR UNDERTAKINGS OF THE MOMENT. THE DISABUSED MAN IS DIFFERENT: FOR HIM, DISAPPOINTMENT OCCURS AT THE SAME TIME AS THE DEED; HE HAS NO NEED TO AWAIT IT, IT IS PRESENT. BY FREEING HIMSELF FROM SUCCESSION, HE HAS DEVOURED THE POSSIBLE AND RENDERED THE FUTURE SUPERFLUOUS. “I CANNOT MEET YOU IN YOUR FUTURE,” HE SAYS TO THE OTHERS. “WE DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE MOMENT IN COMMON.” BECAUSE FOR HIM THE WHOLE OF THE FUTURE IS ALREADY HERE.

WHEN WE PERCEIVE THE END IN THE BEGINNING, WE MOVE FASTER THAN TIME. ILLUMINATION, THAT LIGHTNING DISAPPOINTMENT, AFFORDS A CERTITUDE WHICH TRANSFORMS DISILLUSION INTO DELIVERANCE.



I DISENTANGLE MYSELF FROM APPEARANCES, YET I AM SNARLED IN THEM NONETHELESS; OR RATHER: I AM HALFWAY BETWEEN THESE APPEARANCES AND THAT WHICH INVALIDATES THEM, THAT WHICH HAS NEITHER NAME NOR CONTENT, THAT WHICH IS NOTHING AND EVERYTHING. I SHALL NEVER TAKE THE DECISIVE STEP OUTSIDE THEM; MY NATURE FORCES ME TO DRIFT, TO REMAIN FOREVER IN THE EQUIVOCAL, AND IF I WERE TO ATTEMPT A CLEAN BREAK IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER, I SHOULD PERISH BY MY SALVATION.



MY FACULTY FOR DISAPPOINTMENT SURPASSES UNDERSTANDING. IT IS WHAT LETS ME COMPREHEND BUDDHA, BUT ALSO WHAT KEEPS ME FROM FOLLOWING HIM.



WHAT WE CAN NO LONGER COMMISERATE WITH COUNTS FOR NOTHING—NO LONGER EXISTS. WE REALIZE WHY OUR PAST SO QUICKLY STOPS BEING “OURS” AND TURNS INTO HISTORY, SOMETHING WHICH NO LONGER CONCERNS ANYONE.



IN THE DEEPEST PART OF YOURSELF, ASPIRE TO BE AS DISPOSSESSED, AS LAMENTABLE AS GOD.



TRUE CONTACT BETWEEN BEINGS IS ESTABLISHED ONLY BY MUTE PRESENCE, BY APPARENT NON-COMMUNICATION, BY THAT MYSTERIOUS AND WORDLESS EXCHANGE WHICH RESEMBLES INWARD PRAYER.



WHAT I KNOW AT SIXTY, I KNEW AS WELL AT TWENTY. FORTY YEARS OF A LONG, A SUPERFLUOUS, LABOR OF VERIFICATION.



I AM FOR THE MOST PART SO CONVINCED THAT EVERYTHING IS LACKING IN BASIS, CONSEQUENCE, JUSTIFICATION, THAT IF SOMEONE DARED TO CONTRADICT ME, EVEN THE MAN I MOST ADMIRE, HE WOULD SEEM TO ME A CHARLATAN OR A FOOL



EVEN IN CHILDHOOD I WATCHED THE HOURS FLOW, INDEPENDENT OF ANY REFERENCE, ANY ACTION, ANY EVENT, THE DISJUNCTION OF TIME FROM WHAT WAS NOT ITSELF, ITS AUTONOMOUS EXISTENCE, ITS SPECIAL STATUS, ITS EMPIRE, ITS TYRANNY. I REMEMBER QUITE CLEARLY THAT AFTERNOON WHEN, FOR THE FIRST TIME, CONFRONTING THE EMPTY UNIVERSE, I WAS NO MORE THAN A PASSAGE OF MOMENTS RELUCTANT TO GO ON PLAYING THEIR PROPER PARTS. TIME WAS COMING UNSTUCK FROM BEING—AT MY EXPENSE.



UNLIKE JOB, I HAVE NOT CURSED THE DAY I WAS BORN; ALL THE OTHER DAYS, ON THE CONTRARY, I HAVE COVERED WITH MY ANATHEMAS….



IF DEATH HAD ONLY NEGATIVE ASPECTS, DYING WOULD BE AN UNMANAGEABLE ACTION.



EVERYTHING EXISTS; NOTHING EXISTS. EITHER FORMULA AFFORDS A LIKE SERENITY. THE MAN OF ANXIETY, TO HIS MISFORTUNE, REMAINS BETWEEN THEM, TREMBLING AND PERPLEXED, FOREVER AT THE MERCY OF A NUANCE, INCAPABLE OF GAINING A FOOTHOLD IN THE SECURITY OF BEING OR IN THE ABSENCE OF BEING.



HERE ON THE COAST OF NORMANDY, AT THIS HOUR OF THE MORNING, I NEEDED NO ONE. THE VERY GULLS’ PRESENCE BOTHERED ME: I DROVE THEM OFF WITH STONES. AND HEARING THEIR SUPERNATURAL SHRIEKS, I REALIZED THAT THAT WAS JUST WHAT I WANTED, THAT ONLY THE SINISTER COULD SOOTHE ME, AND THAT IT WAS FOR SUCH A CONFRONTATION THAT I HAD GOT UP BEFORE DAWN.



“IN THIS OUR LIFE”—TO BE IN LIFE: SUDDENLY I AM STRUCK BY THE STRANGENESS OF SUCH AN EXPRESSION, AS IF IT APPLIED TO NO ONE.



WHENEVER I FLAG AND FEEL SORRY FOR MY BRAIN, I AM CARRIED AWAY BY AN IRRESISTIBLE DESIRE TO PROCLAIM. THAT IS THE MOMENT I REALIZE THE PALTRY DEPTHS OUT OF WHICH RISE REFORMERS, PROPHETS, AND SAVIORS.



I LONG TO BE FREE—DESPERATELY FREE. FREE AS THE STILLBORN ARE FREE.



IF THERE IS SO MUCH DISCOMFORT AND AMBIGUITY IN LUCIDITY, IT IS BECAUSE LUCIDITY IS THE RESULT OF THE POOR USE TO WHICH WE HAVE PUT OUR SLEEPLESS NIGHTS.



OUR OBSESSION WITH BIRTH, BY SHIFTING US TO A POINT BEFORE OUR PAST, ROBS US OF OUR PLEASURE IN THE FUTURE, IN THE PRESENT, AND EVEN IN THE PAST.



RARE ARE THE DAYS WHEN, PROJECTED INTO POST-HISTORY, I FAIL TO WITNESS THE GODS’ HILARITY AT LEAVING BEHIND THE HUMAN EPISODE.

WHAT WE NEED IS AN ALTERNATE VISION, WHEN THAT OF THE LAST JUDGMENT NO LONGER SATISFIES ANYONE.



AN IDEA, A BEING, ANYTHING WHICH BECOMES INCARNATE LOSES IDENTITY, TURNS GROTESQUE. FRUSTRATION OF ALL ACHIEVEMENT. NEVER QUIT THE POSSIBLE, WALLOW IN ETERNAL TRIFLING, FORGET TO BE BORN.



THE REAL, THE UNIQUE MISFORTUNE: TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY. A DISASTER WHICH DATES BACK TO AGGRESSIVENESS, TO THE SEED OF EXPANSION AND RAGE WITHIN ORIGINS, TO THE TENDENCY TO THE WORST WHICH FIRST SHOOK THEM UP.



WHEN WE SEE SOMEONE AGAIN AFTER MANY YEARS, WE SHOULD SIT DOWN FACING EACH OTHER AND SAY NOTHING FOR HOURS, SO THAT BY MEANS OF SILENCE OUR CONSTERNATION CAN RELISH ITSELF.





DAYS OF MIRACULOUS STERILITY. INSTEAD OF REJOICING OVER THEM, PROCLAIMING VICTORY, TRANSFORMING THIS DROUGHT INTO A CELEBRATION, SEEING IT AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF MY FULFILLMENT, MY MATURITY, IN SHORT MY DETACHMENT, I LET MYSELF BE INVADED BY SPITE AND RESENTMENT: SO TENACIOUS IS THE OLD ADAM IN US, THE BUSTLING CANAILLE, UNFIT FOR SELF-EFFACEMENT.



I AM ENRAPTURED BY HINDU PHILOSOPHY, WHOSE ESSENTIAL ENDEAVOR IS TO SURMOUNT THE SELF; AND EVERYTHING I DO, EVERYTHING I THINK IS ONLY MYSELF AND THE SELFS HUMILIATIONS.



WHILE WE ARE PERFORMING AN ACTION, WE HAVE A GOAL; PERFORMED, THE ACTION HAS NO MORE REALITY FOR US THAN THE GOAL WE WERE SEEKING. NOTHING OF MUCH CONSEQUENCE HERE—NO MORE THAN A GAME. BUT SOME OF US ARE CONSCIOUS OF THIS GAME IN THE COURSE OF THE ACTION: WE EXPERIENCE THE CONCLUSION IN THE PREMISES, THE ACHIEVED IN THE VIRTUAL—WE UNDERMINE “SERIOUSNESS” BY THE VERY FACT THAT WE EXIST.

THE VISION OF NON-REALITY, OF UNIVERSAL DEFAULT, IS THE PRODUCT OF AN EVERYDAY SENSATION AND A SUDDEN FRISSON. EVERYTHING IS A GAME—WITHOUT SUCH A REVELATION, THE SENSATION WE HAUL THROUGH OUR USUAL LIVES WOULD NOT HAVE THAT CHARACTERISTIC STAMP OUR METAPHYSICAL EXPERIENCES REQUIRE TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR IMITATIONS, OUR DISCOMFORTS. FOR EVERY DISCOMFORT IS ONLY AN ABORTIVE METAPHYSICAL EXPERIENCE.



WHEN WE HAVE WORN OUT THE INTEREST WE ONCE TOOK IN DEATH, WHEN WE REALIZE WE HAVE NOTHING MORE TO GAIN FROM IT, WE FALL BACK ON BIRTH, WE TURN TO A MUCH MORE INEXHAUSTIBLE ABYSS.



AT THIS VERY MOMENT, I AM SUFFERING—AS WE SAY IN FRENCH, J’AI MAL. THIS EVENT, CRUCIAL FOR ME, IS NONEXISTENT, EVEN INCONCEIVABLE FOR ANYONE ELSE, FOR EVERYONE ELSE. EXCEPT FOR GOD, IF THAT WORD CAN HAVE A MEANING.



WOULD GROW, DEVELOP, GATHER FORCE. HENCE WE SEE WHY, BY TAKING, A CONTRARY TRAJECTORY, THEY LACK SPIRIT AND ARE SO WEARY, WHEN AT LAST THEY COME UP AGAINST THEIR INITIAL FRONTIER, THAT THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE ENERGY TO LOOK BEYOND, TOWARD THE “NEVER-BORN.”





IT IS NOT MY BEGINNINGS, IT IS THE BEGINNING THAT MATTERS TO ME. IF I BUMP INTO MY BIRTH, INTO A MINOR OBSESSION, IT IS BECAUSE I CANNOT GRAPPLE WITH THE FIRST MOMENT OF TIME. EVERY INDIVIDUAL DISCOMFORT LEADS BACK, ULTIMATELY, TO A COSMOGONIE DISCOMFORT, EACH OF OUR SENSATIONS EXPIATING THAT CRIME OF THE PRIMORDIAL SENSATION, BY WHICH BEING CREPT OUT OF SOMEWHERE….



THOUGH WE MAY PREFER OURSELVES TO THE UNIVERSE, WE NONETHELESS LOATHE OURSELVES MUCH MORE THAN WE SUSPECT. IF THE WISE MAN IS SO RARE A PHENOMENON, IT IS BECAUSE HE SEEMS UNSHAKEN BY THE AVERSION WHICH, LIKE ALL BEINGS, HE MUST FEEL FOR HIMSELF.



NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BEING AND NON-BEING, IF WE APPREHEND THEM WITH THE SAME INTENSITY.



NESCIENCE IS THE BASIS OF EVERYTHING, IT CREATES EVERYTHING BY AN ACTION REPEATED EVERY MOMENT, IT PRODUCES THIS AND ANY WORLD, SINCE IT CONTINUALLY TAKES FOR REAL WHAT IN FACT IS NOT. NESCIENCE IS THE TREMENDOUS MISTAKE THAT SERVES AS THE BASIS OF ALL OUR TRUTHS, IT IS OLDER AND MORE POWERFUL THAN ALL THE GODS COMBINED.



THIS IS HOW WE RECOGNIZE THE MAN WHO HAS TENDENCIES TOWARD AN INNER QUEST: HE WILL SET FAILURE ABOVE ANY SUCCESS, HE WILL EVEN SEEK IT OUT, UNCONSCIOUSLY OF COURSE. THIS IS BECAUSE FAILURE, ALWAYS ESSENTIAL, REVEALS US TO OURSELVES, PERMITS US TO SEE OURSELVES AS GOD SEES US, WHEREAS SUCCESS DISTANCES US FROM WHAT IS MOST INWARD IN OURSELVES AND INDEED IN EVERYTHING.



THERE WAS A TIME WHEN TIME DID NOT YET EXIST…. THE REJECTION OF BIRTH IS NOTHING BUT THE NOSTALGIA FOR THIS TIME BEFORE TIME.



I THINK OF SO MANY FRIENDS WHO ARE NO MORE, AND I PITY THEM. YET THEY ARE NOT SO MUCH TO BE PITIED, FOR THEY HAVE SOLVED EVERY PROBLEM, BEGINNING WITH THE PROBLEM OF DEATH.



IN THE FACT OF BEING BORN THERE IS SUCH AN ABSENCE OF NECESSITY THAT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE MORE THAN USUAL, YOU ARE LEFT—IGNORANT HOW TO REACT—WITH A FOOLISH GRIN.



TWO KINDS OF MIND: DAYLIGHT AND NOCTURNAL. THEY HAVE NEITHER THE SAME METHOD NOR THE SAME MORALITY. IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, YOU WATCH YOURSELF; IN THE DARK, YOU SPEAK OUT. THE SALUTARY OR AWKWARD CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT HE THINKS MATTER LITTLE TO THE MAN WHO QUESTIONS HIMSELF AT HOURS WHEN OTHERS ARE THE PREY OF SLEEP. HENCE HE MEDITATES UPON THE BAD LUCK OF BEING BORN WITHOUT CONCERN FOR THE HARM HE CAN CAUSE OTHERS OR HIMSELF. AFTER MIDNIGHT BEGINS THE INTOXICATION OF PERNICIOUS TRUTHS.



AS THE YEARS ACCUMULATE, WE FORM AN INCREASINGLY SOMBER IMAGE OF THE FUTURE. IS THIS ONLY TO CONSOLE OURSELVES FOR BEING EXCLUDED FROM IT? YES IN APPEARANCE, NO IN FACT, FOR THE FUTURE HAS ALWAYS BEEN HIDEOUS, MAN BEING ABLE TO REMEDY HIS EVILS ONLY BY AGGRAVATING THEM, SO THAT IN EACH EPOCH EXISTENCE IS MUCH MORE TOLERABLE BEFORE THE SOLUTION IS FOUND TO THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE MOMENT.



IN MAJOR PERPLEXITIES, TRY TO LIVE AS IF HISTORY WERE DONE WITH AND TO REACT LIKE A MONSTER RIDDLED BY SERENITY.



IF I USED TO ASK MYSELF, OVER A COFFIN: “WHAT GOOD DID IT DO THE OCCUPANT TO BE BORN?,” I NOW PUT THE SAME QUESTION ABOUT ANYONE ALIVE.



THE EMPHASIS ON BIRTH IS NO MORE THAN THE CRAVING FOR THE INSOLUBLE CARRIED TO THE POINT OF INSANITY.



REGARDING DEATH, I CEASELESSLY WAVER BETWEEN “MYSTERY” AND “INCONSEQUENTIALITY”—BETWEEN THE PYRAMIDS AND THE MORGUE.



IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FEEL THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE DID NOT EXIST. HENCE OUR ATTACHMENT TO THE PERSONAGE WE WERE BEFORE BEING BORN.





“MEDITATE BUT ONE HOUR UPON THE SELFS NONEXISTENCE AND YOU WILL FEEL YOURSELF TO BE ANOTHER MAN.” SAID A PRIEST OF THE JAPANESE KUSHA SEA TO A WESTERN VISITOR.

WITHOUT HAVING FREQUENTED THE BUDDHIST MONASTERIES, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I NOT LINGERED OVER- THE WORLD’S UNREALITY, AND HENCE MY OWN? I HAVE NOT BECOME ANOTHER MAN FOR THAT, NO, BUT THERE CERTAINLY HAS REMAINED WITH ME THE FEELING THAT MY IDENTITY IS ENTIRELY ILLUSORY, AND THAT BY LOSING IT I HAVE LOST NOTHING, EXCEPT SOMETHING, EXCEPT EVERYTHING.



INSTEAD OF CLINGING TO THE FACT OF BEING BORN, AS GOOD SENSE BIDS, I TAKE THE RISK, I TURN BACK, I RETROGRESS INCREASINGLY TOWARD SOME UNKNOWN BEGINNING, I MOVE FROM ORIGIN TO ORIGIN. SOME DAY, PERHAPS, I SHALL MANAGE TO REACH ORIGIN ITSELF, IN ORDER TO REST THERE, OR BE WRECKED.



X INSULTS ME. I AM ABOUT TO HIT HIM. THINKING IT OVER, I REFRAIN.

WHO AM I? WHICH IS MY REAL SELF: THE SELF OF THE RETORT OR THAT OF THE REFRAINING? MY FIRST REACTION IS ALWAYS ENERGETIC; THE SECOND ONE, FLABBY. WHAT IS KNOWN AS “WISDOM” IS ULTIMATELY ONLY A PERPETUAL “THINKING IT OVER,” I.E., NON-ACTION AS FIRST IMPULSE.



IF ATTACHMENT IS AN EVIL, WE MUST LOOK FOR ITS CAUSE IN THE SCANDAL OF BIRTH, FOR TO BE BORN IS TO BE ATTACHED. DETACHMENT THEN SHOULD APPLY ITSELF TO GETTING RID OF THE TRACES OF THIS SCANDAL, THE MOST SERIOUS AND INTOLERABLE OF ALL.



AMID ANXIETY AND DISTRESS, SUDDEN CALM AT THE THOUGHT OF THE FOETUS ONE HAS BEEN.



AT THIS PRECISE MOMENT, NO REPROACH PROCEEDING FROM MEN OR GODS CAN AFFECT ME: I HAVE AS GOOD A CONSCIENCE AS IF I HAD NEVER EXISTED.



IT IS A MISTAKE TO BELIEVE IN A DIRECT RELATION BETWEEN SUFFERING REVERSES AND BEING DEAD SET AGAINST BIRTH. SUCH OPPOSITION HAS DEEPER, MORE DISTANT ROOTS, AND WOULD OCCUR EVEN IF ONE HAD ONLY THE SHADOW OF A GRIEVANCE AGAINST EXISTENCE. IN FACT IT IS NEVER MORE VIRULENT THAN IN CASES OF EXTREME GOOD FORTUNE.



THRACIANS AND BOGOMILS—I CANNOT FORGET THAT I HAVE HAUNTED THE SAME WHEREABOUTS AS THEY, NOR THAT THE FORMER WEPT OVER THE NEWBORN AND THE LATTER, IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY GOD, HELD SATAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INFAMY OF CREATION.



DURING THE LONG NIGHTS IN THE CAVES, HOW MANY HAMLETS MUST HAVE MURMURED THEIR ENDLESS MONOLOGUES—FOR IT IS LIKELY THAT THE APOGEE OF METAPHYSICAL TORMENT IS TO BE LOCATED WELL BEFORE THAT UNIVERSAL INSIPIDITY WHICH FOLLOWED THE ADVENT OF PHILOSOPHY.



THE OBSESSION WITH BIRTH PROCEEDS FROM AN EXACERBATION OF MEMORY, FROM AN OMNIPRESENCE OF THE PAST, AS WELL AS FROM A CRAVING FOR THE IMPASSE, FOR THE FIRST IMPASSE. —NO OPENNESS, HENCE NO JOY FROM THE PAST BUT SOLELY FROM THE PRESENT, AND FROM A FUTURE EMANCIPATED FROM TIME.



FOR YEARS, IN FACT FOR LIFE, TO HAVE MEDITATED ONLY ON YOUR LAST MOMENTS, ONLY TO DISCOVER, WHEN AT LAST YOU APPROACH THEM, THAT IT WAS OF NO USE, THAT THE THOUGHT OF DEATH HELPS IN EVERYTHING SAVE IN DYING!



IT IS OUR DISCOMFORTS WHICH PROVOKE, WHICH CREATE CONSCIOUSNESS; THEIR TASK ACCOMPLISHED, THEY WEAKEN AND DISAPPEAR ONE AFTER THE OTHER. CONSCIOUSNESS HOWEVER REMAINS AND SURVIVES THEM, WITHOUT RECALLING WHAT IT OWES TO THEM, WITHOUT EVEN EVER HAVING KNOWN. HENCE IT CONTINUALLY PROCLAIMS ITS AUTONOMY, ITS SOVEREIGNTY, EVEN WHEN IT LOATHES ITSELF AND WOULD DO AWAY WITH ITSELF.



ACCORDING TO THE RULE OF SAINT BENEDICT, IF A MONK BECAME PROUD OF OR MERELY SATISFIED WITH THE TASK HE WAS PERFORMING, HE WAS TO FORSAKE IT THEN AND THERE.

ONE DANGER NOT DREADED BY THE MAN WHO HAS LIVED IN THE THIRST FOR UNSATISFACTION, IN AN ORGY OF REMORSE AND DISGUST.



IF IT IS TRUE THAT GOD DISLIKES TAKING SIDES, I SHOULD FEEL NO AWKWARDNESS IN HIS PRESENCE, SO PLEASED WOULD I BE TO IMITATE HIM, TO BE LIKE HIM, IN EVERYTHING, “WITHOUT OPINION.”



TO GET UP IN THE MORNING, WASH AND THEN WAIT FOR SOME UNFORESEEN VARIETY OF DREAD OR DEPRESSION.

I WOULD GIVE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE AND ALL OF SHAKESPEARE FOR A GRAIN OF ATARAXY.



NIETZSCHE’S GREAT LUCK—TO HAVE ENDED AS HE DID: IN EUPHORIA!



ENDLESSLY TO REFER TO A WORLD WHERE NOTHING YET STOOPED TO OCCURRENCE, WHERE YOU ANTICIPATED CONSCIOUSNESS WITHOUT DESIRING IT, WHERE, WALLOWING IN THE VIRTUAL, YOU REJOICED IN THE NULL PLENITUDE OF A SELF ANTERIOR TO SELFHOOD….

NOT TO HAVE BEEN BORN, MERELY MUSING ON THAT—WHAT HAPPINESS, WHAT FREEDOM, WHAT SPACE!

IF DISGUST FOR THE WORLD CONFERRED SANCTITY OF ITSELF, I FAIL TO SEE HOW I COULD AVOID CANONIZATION.



NO ONE HAS LIVED SO CLOSE TO HIS SKELETON AS I HAVE LIVED TO MINE: FROM WHICH RESULTS AN ENDLESS DIALOGUE AND CERTAIN TRUTHS WHICH I MANAGE NEITHER TO ACCEPT NOR TO REJECT.



IT IS EASIER TO GET ON WITH VICES THAN WITH VIRTUES. THE VICES, ACCOMMODATING BY NATURE, HELP EACH OTHER, ARE FULL OF MUTUAL INDULGENCE, WHEREAS THE JEALOUS VIRTUES COMBAT AND ANNIHILATE EACH OTHER, SHOWING IN EVERYTHING THEIR INCOMPATIBILITY AND THEIR INTOLERANCE.



IT IS TRIFLING TO BELIEVE IN WHAT YOU DO OR IN WHAT OTHERS DO. YOU SHOULD AVOID SIMULACRA AND EVEN “REALITIES;” YOU SHOULD TAKE UP A POSITION EXTERNAL TO EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE, DRIVE OFF OR GRIND DOWN YOUR APPETITES, LIVE, ACCORDING TO A HINDU ADAGE, WITH AS FEW DESIRES AS A “SOLITARY ELEPHANT.”



I FORGIVE X EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF HIS OBSOLETE SMILE.



NOT ONE MOMENT WHEN I HAVE NOT BEEN CONSCIOUS OF BEING OUTSIDE PARADISE.



ONLY WHAT YOU HIDE IS PROFOUND, IS TRUE. WHENCE THE POWER OF BASE FEELINGS.



AMA NESARI, SAYS THE IMITATION OF CHRIST. LOVE TO BE UNKNOWN. WE ARE HAPPY WITH OURSELVES AND WITH THE WORLD ONLY WHEN WE CONFORM TO THIS PRECEPT.



THE INTRINSIC VALUE OF A BOOK DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE IMPORTANCE OF ITS SUBJECT (ELSE THE THEOLOGIANS WOULD PREVAIL, AND MIGHTILY), BUT ON THE MANNER OF APPROACHING THE ACCIDENTAL AND THE INSIGNIFICANT, OF MASTERING THE INFINITESIMAL. THE ESSENTIAL HAS NEVER REQUIRED THE LEAST TALENT.



THE FEELING OF BEING TEN THOUSAND YEARS BEHIND, OR AHEAD, OF THE OTHERS, OF BELONGING TO THE BEGINNINGS OR TO THE END OF HUMANITY …



NEGATION NEVER PROCEEDS FROM REASONING BUT FROM SOMETHING MUCH MORE OBSCURE AND OLD. ARGUMENTS COME AFTERWARD, TO JUSTIFY AND SUSTAIN IT. EVERY NO RISES OUT OF THE BLOOD.



WITH THE HELP OF THE EROSION OF MEMORY, TO RECALL THE FIRST INITIATIVES OF MATTER AND THE RISK OF LIFE WHICH FOLLOWED FROM THEM …



EACH TIME I FAIL TO THINK ABOUT DEATH, I HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF CHEATING, OF DECEIVING SOMEONE IN ME.



THERE ARE NIGHTS THAT THE MOST INGENIOUS TORTURERS COULD NOT HAVE INVENTED. WE EMERGE FROM THEM IN PIECES, STUPID, DAZED, WITH NEITHER MEMORIES NOR ANTICIPATIONS, AND WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING WHO WE ARE. AND IT IS THEN THAT THE DAY SEEMS USELESS, LIGHT PERNICIOUS, EVEN MORE OPPRESSIVE THAN THE DARKNESS.



A CONSCIOUS FRUIT FLY WOULD HAVE TO CONFRONT EXACTLY THE SAME DIFFICULTIES, THE SAME KIND OF INSOLUBLE PROBLEMS AS MAN.



BETTER TO BE AN ANIMAL THAN A MAN, AN INSECT THAN AN ANIMAL, A PLANT THAN AN INSECT, AND SO ON.

SALVATION? WHATEVER DIMINISHES THE KINGDOM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND COMPROMISES ITS SUPREMACY.



I HAVE ALL THE DEFECTS OF OTHER PEOPLE AND YET EVERYTHING THEY DO SEEMS TO ME INCONCEIVABLE.



CONSIDERING THINGS ACCORDING TO NATURE, MAN WAS MADE TO LIVE FACING OUTWARD. IF HE WOULD SEE INTO HIMSELF, HE MUST CLOSE HIS EYES, RENOUNCE HIS ENDEAVORS, QUIT THE IMMEDIATE. WHAT IS CALLED “INNER LIFE” IS A BELATED PHENOMENON, POSSIBLE ONLY BY A SLOWING DOWN OF OUR VITAL ACTIVITIES, “THE SOUL” BEING ABLE TO EMERGE AND ELABORATE ITSELF ONLY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE GOOD BEHAVIOR OF OUR ORGANS.



THE MEREST ATMOSPHERIC VARIATION JEOPARDIZES MY PLANS, NOT TO SPEAK OF MY CONVICTIONS. THIS KIND OF DEPENDENCY—THE MOST HUMILIATING KIND—UNFAILINGLY LAYS ME LOW, EVEN AS IT DISSIPATES WHAT FEW ILLUSIONS REMAIN AS TO MY POSSIBILITIES OF BEING FREE AND AS TO FREEDOM ITSELF. WHAT IS THE USE OF SWAGGERING IF YOU ARE AT THE MERCY OF WET AND DRY? ONE CRAVES A LESS LAMENTABLE BONDAGE, AND GODS OF ANOTHER KIDNEY.



IT’S NOT WORTH THE BOTHER OF KILLING YOURSELF, SINCE YOU ALWAYS KILL YOURSELF TOO LATE.



WHEN YOU KNOW QUITE ABSOLUTELY THAT EVERYTHING IS UNREAL, YOU THEN CANNOT SEE WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TROUBLE TO PROVE IT.



AS IT LEAVES DAWN BEHIND AND ADVANCES INTO THE DAY, LIGHT PROSTITUTES ITSELF AND IS REDEEMED—ETHICS OF TWILIGHT—ONLY AT THE MOMENT IT VANISHES.



IN BUDDHIST WRITINGS, MENTION IS OFTEN MADE OF “THE ABYSS OF BIRTH.” AN ABYSS INDEED, A GULF INTO WHICH WE DO NOT FALL BUT FROM WHICH, INSTEAD, WE EMERGE, TO OUR UNIVERSAL CHAGRIN.



AT INCREASINGLY WIDER INTERVALS, IMPULSES OF GRATITUDE TOWARD JOB AND CHAMFORT—TOWARD VOCIFERATION AND VITRIOL …



EACH OPINION, EACH VIEW IS NECESSARILY PARTIAL, TRUNCATED, INADEQUATE. IN PHILOSOPHY AND IN ANYTHING, ORIGINALITY COMES DOWN TO INCOMPLETE DEFINITIONS.



IF WE CONSIDER CLOSELY OUR SO-CALLED GENEROUS ACTIONS, THERE IS NONE WHICH, FROM SOME ASPECT, IS NOT BLAMEWORTHY AND EVEN HARMFUL, SO THAT WE COME TO REGRET HAVING PERFORMED IT—SO THAT WE MUST CHOOSE, FINALLY, BETWEEN ABSTENTION AND REMORSE.



EXPLOSIVE FORCE OF ANY MORTIFICATION. EVERY VANQUISHED DESIRE AFFORDS US POWER. WE HAVE THE MORE HOLD OVER THIS WORLD THE FURTHER WE WITHDRAW FROM IT, THE LESS WE ADHERE TO IT. RENUNCIATION CONFERS AN INFINITE POWER.



MY DISAPPOINTMENTS, INSTEAD OF CONVERGING TOWARD A CENTER AND CONSTITUTING IF NOT A SYSTEM AT LEAST AN ENSEMBLE, ARE SCATTERED, EACH SUPPOSING ITSELF UNIQUE AND THEREBY WASTED, LACKING ORGANIZATION.



THE ONLY SUCCESSFUL PHILOSOPHIES AND RELIGIONS ARE THE ONES THAT FLATTER US, WHETHER IN THE NAME OF PROGRESS OR OF HELL DAMNED OR NOT, MAN EXPERIENCES AN ABSOLUTE NEED TO BE AT THE HEART OF EVERYTHING. IT IS, IN FACT, SOLELY FOR THIS REASON THAT HE IS MAN, THAT HE HAS BECOME MAN. AND IF SOME DAY HE NO LONGER FEELS THIS NEED, HE MUST GIVE WAY TO SOME OTHER ANIMAL PROUDER, MADDER THAN HIMSELF.



HE DETESTED OBJECTIVE TRUTHS, THE BURDEN OF ARGUMENT, SUSTAINED REASONING. HE DISLIKED DEMONSTRATING, HE WANTED TO CONVINCE NO ONE. OTHERS ARE A DIALECTICIAN’S INVENTION.



THE MORE INJURED YOU ARE BY TIME, THE MORE YOU SEEK TO ESCAPE IT. TO WRITE A FAULTLESS PAGE, OR ONLY A SENTENCE, RAISES YOU ABOVE BECOMING AND ITS CORRUPTIONS. YOU TRANSCEND DEATH BY THE PURSUIT OF THE INDESTRUCTIBLE IN SPEECH, IN THE VERY SYMBOL OF NULLITY.



AT THE CLIMAX OF A FAILURE, AT THE MOMENT WHEN SHAME IS ABOUT TO DO US IN, SUDDENLY WE ARE SWEPT AWAY BY A FRENZY OF PRIDE WHICH LASTS ONLY LONG ENOUGH TO DRAIN US, TO LEAVE US WITHOUT ENERGY, TO LOWER, WITH OUR POWERS, THE INTENSITY OF OUR SHAME.



IF DEATH IS AS HORRIBLE AS IS CLAIMED, HOW IS IT THAT AFTER THE PASSAGE OF A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME WE CONSIDER HAPPY ANY BEING, FRIEND OR ENEMY, WHO HAS CEASED TO LIVE?



MORE THAN ONCE, I HAVE MANAGED TO LEAVE MY ROOM, FOR IF I HAD STAYED THERE I COULD NOT BE SURE OF BEING ABLE TO RESIST SOME SUDDEN RESOLUTION. THE STREET IS MORE REASSURING, YOU THINK LESS ABOUT YOURSELF THERE, THERE EVERYTHING WEAKENS AND WILTS, BEGINNING WITH YOUR OWN CONFUSION.



CHARACTERISTIC OF SICKNESS TO STAY AWAKE WHEN EVERYTHING SLEEPS, WHEN EVERYTHING IS AT REST, EVEN THE SICK MAN.



WHEN WE ARE YOUNG, WE TAKE A CERTAIN PLEASURE IN OUR INFIRMITIES. THEY SEEM SO NEW, SO RICH! WITH AGE, THEY NO LONGER SURPRISE US, WE KNOW THEM TOO WELL. NOW, WITHOUT ANYTHING UNEXPECTED IN THEM, THEY DO NOT DESERVE TO BE ENDURED.



ONCE WE APPEAL TO OUR MOST INTIMATE SELVES, ONCE WE BEGIN TO LABOR AND TO PRODUCE, WE LAY CLAIM TO GIFTS, WE BECOME UNCONSCIOUS OF OUR OWN GAPS. NO ONE IS IN A POSITION TO ADMIT THAT WHAT COMES OUT OF HIS OWN DEPTHS MIGHT BE WORTHLESS. “SELF-KNOWLEDGE”? A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS.



ALL THESE POEMS WHERE IT IS MERELY THE POEM THAT IS IN QUESTION—A WHOLE POETRY WITH NO OTHER SUBSTANCE THAN ITSELF! WHAT WOULD WE SAY OF A PRAYER WHOSE OBJECT WAS RELIGION?



THE MIND THAT PUTS EVERYTHING IN QUESTION REACHES, AFTER A THOUSAND INTERROGATIONS, AN ALMOST TOTAL INERTIA, A SITUATION WHICH THE INERT, IN FACT, KNOWS FROM THE START, BY INSTINCT. FOR WHAT IS INERTIA BUT A CONGENITAL PERPLEXITY?



WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT THAT EPICURUS, THE SAGE I MOST NEED, SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN OVER THREE HUNDRED TREATISES! AND WHAT A RELIEF THAT THEY ARE LOST!



“WHAT DO YOU DO FROM MORNING TO NIGHT?” “I ENDURE MYSELF.”



A REMARK OF MY BROTHER’S APROPOS OF THE TROUBLES AND PAINS OUR MOTHER ENDURED: “OLD AGE IS NATURE’S SELF-CRITICISM.”



“ONE MUST BE MAD OR DRUNK,” THE ABBE SIEYÈS SAID, TO SPEAK WELL IN THE KNOWN LANGUAGES. ONE MUST BE DRUNK OR MAD, I SHOULD ADD, TO DARE, STILL, TO USE WORDS, ANY WORD….



THE FANATIC OF ELLIPTICAL GLOOM IS SURE TO EXCEL IN ANY CAREER SAVE THAT OF BEING A WRITER.



HAVING ALWAYS LIVED IN FEAR OF BEING SURPRISED BY THE WORST, I HAVE TRIED IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE TO GET A HEAD START, FLINGING MYSELF INTO MISFORTUNE LONG BEFORE IT OCCURRED.



WE DO NOT ENVY THOSE WHO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO PRAY, WHEREAS WE ARE FILLED WITH ENVY OF THE POSSESSORS OF GOODS, OF THOSE WHO KNOW WEALTH AND FAME. STRANGE THAT WE RESIGN OURSELVES TO SOMEONE’S SALVATION AND NOT TO WHAT FUGITIVE ADVANTAGES HE MAY ENJOY.



I NEVER MET ONE INTERESTING MIND THAT WAS NOT RICHLY ENDOWED WITH INADMISSIBLE DEFICIENCIES.



NO TRUE ART WITHOUT A STRONG DOSE OF BANALITY. THE CONSTANT EMPLOYMENT OF THE UNACCUSTOMED READILY WEARIES US, NOTHING BEING MORE UNENDURABLE THAN THE UNIFORMITY OF THE EXCEPTIONAL.



THE TROUBLE WITH USING A BORROWED LANGUAGE IS THAT YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO MAKE TOO MANY MISTAKES IN IT. NOW, IT IS BY SEEKING A CERTAIN INCORRECTNESS WITHOUT HOWEVER ABUSING IT, IT IS BY CONTINUALLY APPROACHING SOLECISM, THAT WRITING MAY BE GIVEN THE APPEARANCE OF LIFE.



EACH OF US BELIEVES, QUITE UNCONSCIOUSLY OF COURSE, THAT HE ALONE PURSUES THE TRUTH, WHICH THE REST ARE INCAPABLE OF SEEKING OUT AND UNWORTHY OF ATTAINING. THIS MADNESS IS SO DEEP-ROOTED AND SO USEFUL THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO REALIZE WHAT WOULD BECOME OF EACH OF US IF IT WERE SOMEDAY TO DISAPPEAR.



THE FIRST THINKER WAS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE FIRST MAN OBSESSED BY WHY. AN UNACCUSTOMED MANIA, NOT AT ALL CONTAGIOUS: RARE INDEED ARE THOSE WHO SUFFER FROM IT, WHO ARE A PREY TO QUESTIONING, AND WHO CAN ACCEPT NO GIVEN BECAUSE THEY WERE BORN IN CONSTERNATION.



TO BE OBJECTIVE IS TO TREAT OTHERS AS YOU TREAT AN OBJECT, A CORPSE—TO BEHAVE WITH THEM LIKE AN UNDERTAKER.



THIS VERY SECOND HAS VANISHED FOREVER, LOST IN THE ANONYMOUS MASS OF THE IRREVOCABLE. IT WILL NEVER RETURN. I SUFFER FROM THIS, AND I DO NOT. EVERYTHING IS UNIQUE—AND INSIGNIFICANT.



EMILY BRONTË: EVERYTHING THAT COMES FROM HER HAS THE CAPACITY TO OVERWHELM ME. HAWORTH IS MY MECCA.



TO WALK ALONG A STREAM, TO PASS, TO FLOW WITH THE WATER, WITHOUT EFFORT, WITHOUT HASTE, WHILE DEATH CONTINUES IN US ITS RUMINATIONS, ITS UNINTERRUPTED SOLILOQUY …



ONLY GOD HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF ABANDONING US. MEN CAN ONLY DROP US.



WITHOUT THE FACULTY OF FORGETTING, OUR PAST WOULD WEIGH SO HEAVILY ON OUR PRESENT THAT WE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH TO CONFRONT ANOTHER MOMENT, STILL LESS TO LIVE THROUGH IT. LIFE WOULD BE BEARABLE ONLY TO FRIVOLOUS NATURES, THOSE IN FACT WHO DO NOT REMEMBER.



PLOTINUS, PORPHYRY TELLS US, HAD THE GIFT OF READING MEN’S SOULS. ONE DAY, WITHOUT ANY WARNING, HE TOLD HIS ASTOUNDED DISCIPLE NOT TO TRY KILLING HIMSELF BUT RATHER TO TAKE A JOURNEY. PORPHYRY LEFT FOR SICILY: THERE HE WAS CURED OF HIS MELANCHOLY BUT, HE ADDS REGRETFULLY, HE THEREBY MISSED BEING PRESENT AT HIS MASTER’S DEATH, WHICH OCCURRED DURING HIS ABSENCE.

IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE PHILOSOPHERS HAVE READ MEN’S SOULS. IT IS NOT THEIR TASK, WE ARE TOLD. PERHAPS. BUT WE MUST NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY NO LONGER MATTER MUCH TO US.



A WORK EXISTS ONLY IF IT IS ELABORATED IN THE DARKNESS WITH ATTENTION, WITH ALL THE CARE OF THE MURDERER PLOTTING HIS CRIME. IN BOTH CASES, WHAT COUNTS IS THE WILL TO STRIKE.



SELF-KNOWLEDGE—THE BITTEREST KNOWLEDGE OF ALL AND ALSO THE KIND WE CULTIVATE LEAST: WHAT IS THE USE OF CATCHING OURSELVES OUT, MORNING TO NIGHT, IN THE ACT OF ILLUSION, PITILESSLY TRACING EACH ACT BACK TO ITS ROOT, AND LOSING CASE AFTER CASE BEFORE OUR OWN TRIBUNAL?



EACH TIME I HAVE A LAPSE OF MEMORY, I THINK OF THE ANGUISH WHICH MUST AFFLICT THOSE WHO KNOW THEY NO LONGER REMEMBER ANYTHING. BUT SOMETHING TELLS ME THAT AFTER A CERTAIN TIME A SECRET JOY POSSESSES THEM, A JOY THEY WOULD NOT AGREE TO TRADE FOR ANY OF THEIR MEMORIES, EVEN THE MOST STIRRING….



TO CLAIM YOU ARE MORE DETACHED, MORE ALIEN TO EVERYTHING THAN ANYONE, AND TO BE MERELY A FANATIC OF INDIFFERENCE!



THE MORE YOU ARE A VICTIM OF CONTRADICTORY IMPULSES, THE LESS YOU KNOW WHICH TO YIELD TO. TO LACK CHARACTER—PRECISELY THAT AND NOTHING BUT.



PURE TIME, TIME DECANTED, FREED OF EVENTS, BEINGS, AND THINGS, APPEARS ONLY AT CERTAIN MOMENTS OF THE NIGHT, WHEN YOU FEEL IT COMING ON, WITH THE ONE INTENTION OF SWEEPING YOU OFF TOWARD AN EXEMPLARY CATASTROPHE.

SUDDENLY FEELING THAT YOU KNOW AS MUCH AS GOD ABOUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING AND QUITE AS SUDDENLY SEEING THIS SENSATION VANISH …



FIRSTHAND THINKERS MEDITATE UPON THINGS; THE OTHERS UPON PROBLEMS. WE MUST LIVE FACE TO FACE WITH BEING, AND NOT WITH THE MIND.



“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR IN ORDER TO GIVE UP?” —EACH SICKNESS SENDS US A SUMMONS DISGUISED AS A QUESTION. WE PLAY DEAF, EVEN AS WE REALIZE THAT THE GAME IS PLAYED OUT AND THAT NEXT TIME WE MUST HAVE THE COURAGE, AT LAST, TO CAPITULATE.



THE OLDER I GROW, THE LESS I REACT TO FRENZY, DELIRIUM. MY TASTE, AMONG THINKERS, NOW GOES ONLY TO EXTINCT VOLCANOES.



AS A YOUNG MAN, I BORED MYSELF TO DEATH, BUT I BELIEVED IN MYSELF. IF I HAD NO SUSPICION OF THE DREARY CREATURE I WAS TO BECOME, I KNEW NONETHELESS THAT, WHATEVER HAPPENED, PERPLEXITY WOULD NOT DESERT ME, THAT IT WOULD KEEP WATCH OVER MY YEARS WITH ALL THE ZEAL AND EXACTITUDE OF PROVIDENCE.



IF WE COULD SEE OURSELVES AS OTHERS SEE US, WE WOULD VANISH ON THE SPOT.



I ONCE REMARKED TO AN ITALIAN FRIEND THAT THE LATIN PEOPLES ARE WITHOUT SECRECY—TOO OPEN, TOO GARRULOUS—AND THAT I PREFERRED NATIONS RAVAGED BY TIMIDITY, ADDING THAT A WRITER WHO HAS FAILED TO KNOW IT IN HIS LIFE IS WORTHLESS IN HIS WRITINGS. “YOU’RE RIGHT,” HE ANSWERED. “WHEN WE DESCRIBE OUR EXPERIENCES IN OUR BOOKS, THERE IS A LACK OF INTENSITY, AND OF EXTENSION, FOR WE HAVE ALREADY TOLD THEM A HUNDRED TIMES BEFORE.” WHEREUPON WE TALKED ABOUT THE LITERATURE OF FEMININITY, OF ITS ABSENCE OF MYSTERY IN COUNTRIES WHERE THE SALON AND THE CONFESSIONAL PREVAIL.



WE SHOULD NEVER DEPRIVE OURSELVES, I FORGET WHO ONCE REMARKED, OF THE “PLEASURES OF PIETY.” HAS RELIGION EVER BEEN JUSTIFIED MORE DELICATELY?



THIS CRAVING TO REVISE OUR ENTHUSIASMS, TO CHANGE IDOLS, TO PRAY ELSEWHERE …



TO STRETCH OUT IN A FIELD, TO SMELL THE EARTH AND TELL YOURSELF IT IS THE END AS WELL AS THE HOPE OF OUR DEJECTIONS, THAT IT WOULD BE FUTILE TO SEARCH FOR ANYTHING BETTER TO FEST ON, TO DISSOLVE INTO. …



WHEN I HAPPEN TO BE BUSY, I NEVER GIVE A MOMENT’S THOUGHT TO THE “MEANING” OF ANYTHING, PARTICULARLY OF WHATEVER IT IS I AM DOING. A PROOF THAT THE SECRET OF EVERYTHING IS IN ACTION AND NOT IN ABSTENTION, THAT FATAL CAUSE OF CONSCIOUSNESS.



WHAT WILL BE THE PHYSIOGNOMY OF PAINTING, OF POETRY, OF MUSIC, IN A HUNDRED YEARS? NO ONE CAN TELL. AS AFTER THE FALL OF ATHENS, OF ROME, A LONG PAUSE WILL INTERVENE, CAUSED BY THE EXHAUSTION OF THE MEANS OF EXPRESSION, AS WELL AS BY THE EXHAUSTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF. HUMANITY, TO REJOIN THE PAST, MUST INVENT A SECOND NAÏVETÉ, WITHOUT WHICH THE ARTS CAN NEVER BEGIN AGAIN.



IN ONE OF THE CHAPELS OF THIS IDEALLY UGLY CHURCH, WE FIND THE VIRGIN STANDING WITH HER SON ABOVE THE GLOBE: AN AGGRESSIVE SECT WHICH HAS UNDERMINED AND CONQUERED AN EMPIRE AND INHERITED ITS FLAWS, BEGINNING WITH GIGANTISM.



IT IS WRITTEN IN THE ZOHAR: “WHEN MAN APPEARED, THEREUPON APPEARED THE FLOWERS.” I SUSPECT THEY WERE THERE LONG BEFORE HIM, AND THAT HIS ADVENT PLUNGED THEM ALL INTO A STUPEFACTION FROM WHICH THEY HAVE NOT YET RECOVERED.



IMPOSSIBLE TO READ A LINE BY KLEIST WITHOUT THINKING THAT HE COMMITTED SUICIDE: AS IF HIS SUICIDE HAD PRECEDED HIS WORKS.



IN THE ORIENT, THE ODDEST, THE MOST IDIOSYNCRATIC WESTERN THINKERS WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN TAKEN SERIOUSLY, ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CONTRADICTIONS. THIS IS PRECISELY WHY WE ARE INTERESTED IN THEM. WE PREFER NOT A MIND BUT THE REVERSALS, THE BIOGRAPHY OF A MIND, THE INCOMPATIBILITIES AND ABERRATIONS TO BE FOUND THERE, IN SHORT THOSE THINKERS WHO, UNABLE TO CONFORM TO THE REST OF HUMANITY AND STILL LESS TO THEMSELVES, CHEAT AS MUCH BY WHIM AS BY FATALITY. THEIR DISTINCTIVE SIGN? A TOUCH OF FAKERY IN THE TRAGIC, A HINT OF DALLIANCE EVEN IN THE IRREMEDIABLE.



IF, IN HER FOUNDATIONS, TERESA OF AVILA LINGERS OVER THE SUBJECT OF MELANCHOLIA, IT IS BECAUSE SHE RECOGNIZES IT AS INCURABLE. PHYSICIANS, SHE SAYS, CANNOT DEAL WITH IT, AND THE MOTHER SUPERIOR OF A CONVENT, FACED WITH SUCH SUFFERERS, HAS BUT ONE RECOURSE: TO INSPIRE THEM WITH THE DREAD OF AUTHORITY, TO THREATEN THEM, TO FRIGHTEN THEM. THE SAINT’S METHOD REMAINS THE BEST: ONLY KICKS, SLAPS, AND A GOOD BEATING WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN THE CASE OF A “DEPRESSIVE.” MOREOVER, SUCH TREATMENT IS PRECISELY WHAT THE “DEPRESSIVE” HIMSELF RESORTS TO WHEN HE DECIDES TO END IT ALL: HE MERELY EMPLOYS MORE THOROUGH MEANS.



IN RELATION TO ANY ACT OF LIFE, THE MIND ACTS AS A KILLJOY.



EASY TO IMAGINE THE ELEMENTS, BORED WITH THEIR EXHAUSTED THEME, DISGUSTED BY THEIR INVARIABLE AND UTTERLY PREDICTABLE COMBINATIONS, SEEKING SOME DIVERSION: LIFE WOULD BE MERELY A DIGRESSION, MERELY AN ANECDOTE….



ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE SEEMS TO ME PERNICIOUS AND AT BEST FUTILE. IF NEED BE I CAN ROUSE MYSELF BUT NOT ACT. I UNDERSTAND ALL TOO WELL WORDSWORTH’S DESCRIPTION OF COLERIDGE: ETERNAL ACTIVITY WITHOUT ACTION.



WHENEVER SOMETHING STILL SEEMS POSSIBLE, I HAVE THE SENSE I HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED.



THE ONE SINCERE CONFESSION IS THE ONE WE MAKE INDIRECTLY—WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.



WE DO NOT ADOPT A BELIEF BECAUSE IT IS TRUE (THEY ARE ALL TRUE), BUT BECAUSE SOME OBSCURE POWER IMPELS US TO DO SO. WHEN THIS POWER LEAVES US, WE SUFFER PROSTRATION AND COLLAPSE, A TÊTE-À-TÊTE WITH WHAT IS LEFT OF OURSELVES.



“THE QUALITY OF EVERY PERFECT FORM IS TO RELEASE THE MIND IMMEDIATELY, WHEREAS THE CORRUPT FORM HOLDS THE MIND PRISONER, LIKE A BAD MIRROR WHICH TELLS US OF NOTHING BUT ITSELF.” IN KLEIST’S PRAISE—AND HOW UN-GERMAN IT SOUNDS—OF LIMPIDITY, HIS TARGET WAS NOT PHILOSOPHY IN PARTICULAR. YET HIS IS THE BEST POSSIBLE CRITIQUE OF PHILOSOPHICAL JARGON, A PSEUDO-LANGUAGE WHICH, ATTEMPTING TO REFLECT IDEAS, MERELY ASSUMES A CONTOUR AT THEIR EXPENSE, MERELY DENATURES AND DARKENS THEM, MERELY CALLS ATTENTION TO ITSELF. BY ONE OF THE MOST TROUBLESOME OF ALL USURPATIONS, THE WORD HAS TAKEN THE LEADING ROLE IN A REALM WHERE IT SHOULD BE IMPERCEPTIBLE.



“O SATAN, MY MASTER, I GIVE MYSELF UNTO THEE FOREVER!” HOW I REGRET NOT REMEMBERING THE NAME OF THE NUN WHO, HAVING WRITTEN THESE WORDS WITH A NAIL DIPPED IN HER OWN BLOOD, DESERVES TO FIGURE IN AN ANTHOLOGY OF PRAYER AND CONCISION.



CONSCIOUSNESS IS MUCH MORE THAN THE THORN, IT IS THE DAGGER IN THE FLESH.



FEROCITY OCCURS IN ALL CONDITIONS SAVE IN JOY. SCHADENFREUDE, MALICIOUS JOY, IS A MISREPRESENTATION. TO DO EVIL IS A PLEASURE, NOT A JOY. JOY, THE ONE TRUE VICTORY OVER THE WORLD, IS PURE IN ITS ESSENCE, HENCE IRREDUCIBLE TO PLEASURE, WHICH IS ALWAYS SUSPECT, BOTH IN ITSELF AND IN ITS MANIFESTATIONS.



AN EXISTENCE CONSTANTLY TRANSFIGURED BY FAILURE.



THE WISE MAN CONSENTS TO EVERYTHING, FOR HE IDENTIFIES HIMSELF WITH NOTHING. AN OPPORTUNIST WITHOUT DESIRES.



NATURE’S GREAT MISTAKE WAS TO HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO CONFINE HERSELF TO ONE “KINGDOM”: JUXTAPOSED WITH THE VEGETABLE, EVERYTHING ELSE SEEMS INOPPORTUNE, OUT OF PLACE. THE SUN SHOULD HAVE SULKED AT THE APPEARANCE OF THE FIRST INSECT, AND GONE OUT ALTOGETHER WITH THE ADVENT OF THE CHIMPANZEE.



IF, AS WE GROW OLDER, WE SCRUTINIZE OUR OWN PAST AT THE EXPENSE OF “PROBLEMS,” IT IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE HANDLE MEMORIES MORE READILY THAN IDEAS.



THE LAST WHOSE DISLOYALTY WRE FORGIVE ARE THOSE WE HAVE DISAPPOINTED.



WHAT OTHER PEOPLE DO WE ALWAYS FEEL WE COULD DO BETTER. UNFORTUNATELY WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME FEELING ABOUT WHAT WE OURSELVES DO.



“I WAS THE PROPHET,” MOHAMMED INFORMS US, “WHEN ADAM WAS STILL BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE CLAY.” … WHEN WE HAVE NOT HAD THE PRIDE TO FOUND A RELIGION—OR AT LEAST TO DESTROY ONE—HOW DO WE DARE SHOW OURSELVES IN THE LIGHT OF DAY?



DETACHMENT CANNOT BE LEARNED: IT IS INSCRIBED IN A CIVILIZATION. WE DO NOT TEND TOWARD IT, WE DISCOVER IT IN OURSELVES. I WAS THINKING THIS WHEN I READ THAT A MISSIONARY, AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS IN JAPAN, HAD MADE ONLY SIXTY CONVERTS, AND OLD ONES AT THAT MOREOVER THEY ESCAPED HIM AT THE LAST MOMENT, DYING IN JAPANESE FASHION, WITHOUT REMORSE, WITHOUT TORMENTS, WORTHY DESCENDANTS OF THEIR ANCESTORS WHO, TO INURE THEMSELVES, IN THE DAYS OF THE MONGOL WARS, LET THEMSELVES BE IMPREGNATED BY THE NOTHINGNESS OF ALL THINGS AND BY THEIR OWN NOTHINGNESS.



WE CAN MEDITATE UPON ETERNITY ONLY IN A PRONE POSITION. FOR A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD, ETERNITY WAS THE ORIENTALS’ PRINCIPAL CONCERN: DID THEY NOT PREFER THE HORIZONTAL POSITION? ONCE WE LIE DOWN, TIME CEASES TO PASS, TO COUNT. HISTORY IS THE PRODUCT OF A RACE THAT STANDS. AS A VERTICAL ANIMAL, MAN WAS TO GET INTO THE HABIT OF LOOKING AHEAD, NOT ONLY IN SPACE BUT IN TIME AS WELL. TO WHICH WRETCHED ORIGINS WE MAY TRACE THE FUTURE!



EVERY MISANTHROPE, HOWEVER SINCERE, AT TIMES REMINDS ME OF THAT OLD POET, BEDRIDDEN AND UTTERLY FORGOTTEN, WHO IN A RAGE WITH HIS CONTEMPORARIES DECLARED HE WOULD RECEIVE NONE OF THEM. HIS WIFE, OUT OF CHARITY, WOULD RING AT THE DOOR FROM TIME TO TIME….



A WORK IS FINISHED WHEN WE CAN NO LONGER IMPROVE IT, THOUGH WE KNOW IT TO BE INADEQUATE AND INCOMPLETE. WE ARE SO OVERTAXED BY IT THAT WE NO LONGER HAVE THE POWER TO ADD A SINGLE COMMA, HOWEVER INDISPENSABLE. WHAT DETERMINES THE DEGREE TO WHICH A WORK IS DONE IS NOT A REQUIREMENT OF ART OR OF TRUTH, IT IS EXHAUSTION AND, EVEN MORE, DISGUST.



WHEREAS ANY SENTENCE ONE HAS TO WRITE REQUIRES A PRETENSE OF INVENTION, IT TAKES LITTLE ENOUGH ATTENTION TO ENTER INTO A TEXT, EVEN A DIFFICULT ONE. TO SCRIBBLE A POSTCARD COMES CLOSER TO CREATIVE ACTIVITY THAN TO READ THE PHENOMENOLOGY OF MIND.



BUDDHISM CALLS ANGER, “CORRUPTION OF THE MIND,” MANICHEISM “ROOT OF THE TREE OF DEATH.” I KNOW THIS, BUT WHAT GOOD DOES IT DO ME TO KNOW?



SHE MEANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO ME. REALIZING, SUDDENLY, AFTER SO MANY YEARS, THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS I SHALL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN, I NEARLY COLLAPSED. WE UNDERSTAND WHAT DEATH IS ONLY BY SUDDENLY REMEMBERING THE FACE OF SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE TO US.



AS ART SINKS INTO PARALYSIS, ARTISTS MULTIPLY. THIS ANOMALY CEASES TO BE ONE IF WE REALIZE THAT ART, ON ITS WAY TO EXHAUSTION, HAS BECOME BOTH IMPOSSIBLE AND EASY.



NO ONE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HE IS NOR EVEN FOR WHAT HE DOES. THIS IS OBVIOUS AND EVERYONE MORE OR LESS AGREES THAT IT IS SO. THEN WHY CELEBRATE OR DENIGRATE? BECAUSE TO EXIST IS TO EVALUATE, TO EMIT JUDGMENTS, AND BECAUSE ABSTENTION, WHEN IT IS NOT THE EFFECT OF APATHY OR COWARDICE, REQUIRES AN EFFORT NO ONE MANAGES TO MAKE.



EVERY FORM OF HASTE, EVEN TOWARD THE GOOD, BETRAYS SOME MENTAL DISORDER.



THE LEAST IMPURE THOUGHTS ARE THOSE WHICH APPEAR BETWEEN OUR ANXIETIES, IN THE INTERVALS OF OUR ANNOYANCE, IN THOSE DELUXE MOMENTS OUR MISERY GRANTS ITSELF.



IMAGINARY PAINS ARE BY FAR THE MOST REAL WE SUFFER, SINCE WE FEEL A CONSTANT NEED FOR THEM AND INVENT THEM BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY OF DOING WITHOUT THEM.



IF IT IS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WISE MAN TO DO NOTHING USELESS, NO ONE WILL SURPASS ME IN WISDOM: I DO NOT EVEN LOWER MYSELF TO USEFUL THINGS.



IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A DEGRADED ANIMAL, A SUB-ANIMAL.



O TO HAVE BEEN BORN BEFORE MAN!



TRY AS I WILL, I CANNOT MANAGE TO SCORN ALL THOSE CENTURIES DURING WHICH MEN BUSIED THEMSELVES WITH NOTHING MORE THAN PERFECTING A DEFINITION OF GOD.



THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO AVOID DEJECTION, MOTIVATED OR GRATUITOUS, IS TO TAKE A DICTIONARY, PREFERABLY OF A LANGUAGE YOU SCARCELY KNOW, AND TO LOOK UP WORD AFTER WORD IN IT, MAKING SURE THAT THEY ARE THE KIND YOU WILL NEVER USE….



AS LONG AS YOU LIVE ON THIS SIDE OF THE TERRIBLE, YOU WILL FIND WORDS TO EXPRESS IT; ONCE YOU KNOW IT FROM INSIDE, YOU WILL NO LONGER FIND A SINGLE ONE.



THERE IS NO LIMIT-DISAPPOINTMENT.



GRIEVANCES OF EVERY KIND PASS, BUT THEIR SOURCE ABIDES, AND NOTHING HAS ANY EFFECT ON IT: UNASSAILABLE AND UNVARYING, IT IS OUR FATUM.



TO REALIZE, IN RAGE AND DESOLATION ALIKE, THAT NATURE, AS BOSSUET SAYS, WILL NOT LONG GRANT US “THIS MORSEL OF MATTER SHE LENDS.”—THIS MORSEL OF MATTER:. BY DINT OF PONDERING IT WE REACH PEACE, THOUGH A PEACE IT WOULD BE BETTER NEVER TO HAVE KNOWN.



PARADOX IS NOT SUITED TO BURIALS, NOR TO WEDDINGS OR BIRTHS, IN FACT. SINISTER—OR GROTESQUE—EVENTS REQUIRE COMMONPLACES; THE TERRIBLE, LIKE THE PAINFUL, ACCOMMODATES ONLY THE CLICHÉ.



HOWEVER DISABUSED ONE MAY BE, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE WITHOUT ANY HOPE AT ALL. WE ALWAYS KEEP ONE, UNWITTINGLY, AND THIS UNCONSCIOUS HOPE MAKES UP FOR ALL THE EXPLICIT OTHERS WE HAVE REJECTED, EXHAUSTED.



THE MORE LADEN HE IS WITH YEARS, THE MORE READILY HE SPEAKS OF HIS DEATH AS A DISTANT, QUITE UNLIKELY EVENT. LIFE IS NOW SUCH A HABIT THAT HE HAS BECOME UNFIT FOR DEATH.



A BLIND MAN, AUTHENTICALLY BLIND FOR ONCE, HELD OUT HIS HAND: IN HIS POSTURE, HIS RIGIDITY, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT CAUGHT YOU, THAT MADE YOU HOLD YOUR BREATH. HE WAS HANDING YOU HIS BLINDNESS.



WE FORGIVE ONLY MADMEN AND CHILDREN FOR BEING FRANK WITH US: OTHERS, IF THEY HAVE THE AUDACITY TO IMITATE THEM, WILL REGRET IT SOONER OR LATER.



TO BE “HAPPY” YOU MUST CONSTANTLY BEAR IN MIND THE MISERIES YOU HAVE ESCAPED. THIS WOULD BE A WAY FOR MEMORY TO REDEEM ITSELF, SINCE ORDINARILY IT PRESERVES ONLY DISASTERS, EAGER—AND WITH WHAT SUCCESS!—TO SABOTAGE HAPPINESS.



AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT, THE PEOPLE IN THE STREET SEEM AUTOMATONS. NO ONE SEEMS TO BREATHE, TO WALK. EACH LOOKS AS IF HE IS WORKED BY CLOCKWORK: NOTHING SPONTANEOUS; MECHANICAL SMILES, SPECTRAL GESTICULATIONS. YOURSELF A SPECTER, HOW WOULD YOU SEE OTHERS AS ALIVE?



TO BE STERILE—WITH SO MANY SENSATIONS! PERPETUAL POETRY WITHOUT WORDS.



PURE FATIGUE—FATIGUE WITHOUT CAUSE, THE KIND THAT COMES LIKE A GIFT OR A SCOURGE: THAT IS WHAT HELPS ME PULL MYSELF TOGETHER, THAT IS WHAT AFFORDS ME KNOWLEDGE OF MY “SELF.” ONCE IT LEAVES ME, I AM NO MORE THAN AN INANIMATE OBJECT.



ANYTHING IN FOLKLORE THAT REMAINS ALIVE COMES FROM BEFORE CHRISTIANITY. —THE SAME IS TRUE OF WHATEVER IS ALIVE IN EACH OF US.



A MAN WHO FEARS RIDICULE WILL NEVER GO FAR, FOR GOOD OR ILL: HE REMAINS ON THIS SIDE OF HIS TALENTS, AND EVEN IF HE HAS GENIUS, HE IS DOOMED TO MEDIOCRITY.



“AMID YOUR MOST INTENSE ACTIVITIES, PAUSE A MOMENT TO ‘CONSIDER’ YOUR MIND”—THIS ADVICE IS SURELY NOT OFFERED TO THOSE WHO “CONSIDER” THEIR MINDS NIGHT AND DAY, AND WHO THEREBY HAVE NO NEED TO SUSPEND THEIR ACTIVITIES, FOR THE GOOD REASON THAT THEY ENGAGE IN NONE.



ONLY WHAT HAS BEEN CONCEIVED IN SOLITUDE, FACE TO FACE WITH GOD, ENDURES—WHETHER ONE IS A BELIEVER OR NOT



A PASSION FOR MUSK IS IN ITSELF AN AVOWAL. WE KNOW MORE ABOUT A STRANGER WHO YIELDS HIMSELF UP TO IT THAN ABOUT SOMEONE WHO IS DEAF TO MUSK AND WHOM WE SEE EVERY DAY.



NO MEDITATION WITHOUT A TENDENCY TO REPETITIVENESS.



AS LONG AS GOD HAD HIM IN TOW, MAN ADVANCED SLOWLY, SO SLOWLY HE DID NOT EVEN REALIZE IT. NOW THAT HE NO LONGER LIVES IN ANYONE’S SHADOW, HE IS IN A RUSH, AND DEPLORES IT—HE WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO REGAIN THE OLD CADENCE.



WE HAVE LOST, BEING BORN, AS MUCH AS WE SHALL LOSE, DYING. EVERYTHING.



SATIETY—I HAVE JUST NOW UTTERED THIS WORD, AND ALREADY I NO LONGER KNOW APROPOS OF WHAT, SO READILY DOES IT APPLY TO EVERYTHING I FEEL AND THINK, TO EVERYTHING I LOVE AND LOATHE, TO SATIETY ITSELF.



I HAVE KILLED NO ONE, I HAVE DONE BETTER: I HAVE KILLED THE POSSIBLE, AND LIKE MACBETH, WHAT I NEED MOST IS TO PRAY, BUT LIKE HIM TOO, I CANNOT SAY AMEN.

TO DELIVER MOWS NONE OF WHICH LAND, TO ATTACK EVERYONE WITHOUT ANYONE’S NOTICING, TO SHOOT ARROWS WHOSE POISON YOU ALONE RECEIVE!



X, WHOM I HAVE ALWAYS TREATED AS BADLY AS I COULD, DOES NOT RESENT ME BECAUSE HE RESENTS NO ONE. HE FORGIVES EVERY INSULT, HE EVEN FORGETS THEM. HOW I ENVY HIM! TO BE LIKE HIM, I SHOULD HAVE TO LIVE THROUGH SEVERAL EXISTENCES AND EXHAUST ALL MY POSSIBILITIES OF TRANSMIGRATION.



IN THE DAYS WHEN I SET OFF ON MONTH-LONG BICYCLE TRIPS ACROSS FRANCE, MY GREATEST PLEASURE WAS TO STOP IN COUNTRY CEMETERIES, TO STRETCH OUT BETWEEN TWO GRAVES, AND TO SMOKE FOR HOURS ON END. I THINK OF THOSE DAYS AS THE MOST ACTIVE PERIOD OF MY LIFE.



HOW CAN YOU CONTROL YOURSELF, MASTER YOUR BEHAVIOR, WHEN YOU COME FROM A COUNTRY WHERE PEOPLE HOWL AT FUNERALS?



ON CERTAIN MORNINGS, NO SOONER HAVE I STEPPED OUT THE DOOR THAN I HEAR VOICES CALLING MY NAME. AM I REALLY ME? IS IT REALLY MY TAKE ANOTHER STEP, I STOOD THERE NAILED TO THE SPOT, PETRIFIED IMPOSSIBILITY—THIS ORDINARY WORD CAME, MORE APROPOS THAN USUAL, TO ENLIGHTEN ME AS TO MYSELF, NO LESS THAN AS TO THE WORD AS WELL: IT HAD SO OFTEN COME TO MY AID, YET NEVER AS NOW. AT LAST I UNDERSTOOD, DEFINITIVELY, WHAT IT MEANT….



AN ANCIENT CLEANING WOMAN, IN ANSWER TO MY “HOW’S EVERYTHING GOING?” ANSWERS WITHOUT LOOKING UP: “TAKING ITS COURSE.” THIS ULTRA-BANAL ANSWER NEARLY BRINGS ME TO TEARS.

THE MORE SUCH TURNS OF SPEECH, WHICH DEAL WITH BECOMING, WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, WITH THE COURSE OF THINGS, ARE WORN DOWN, THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO ACQUIRE THE QUALITY OF A REVELATION. BUT THE TRUTH IS NOT THAT THEY CREATE AN EXCEPTIONAL STATE, ONLY THAT YOU YOURSELF WERE IN THAT STATE WITHOUT REALIZING IT, AND THAT IT REQUIRED ONLY A SIGN OR A PRETEXT FOR THE EXTRAORDINARY TO OCCUR.



WE LIVED IN THE COUNTRY, I WENT TO SCHOOL, AND—AN IMPORTANT DETAIL—I SLEPT IN MY PARENTS’ ROOM. AT NIGHT IT WAS MY FATHER’S HABIT TO READ ALOUD TO MY MOTHER. THOUGH HE WAS A GREEK ORTHODOX PRIEST, HE WOULD READ ANYTHING, DOUBTLESS ASSUMING THAT AT MY AGE I WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND. USUALLY I DIDN’T EVEN LISTEN AND FELL ASLEEP, UNLESS THE TEXT WAS SOME GRIPPING STORY. ONE NIGHT I PRICKED UP MY EARS. HE WAS READING THE SCENE FROM A BIOGRAPHY OF RASPUTIN WHERE THE FATHER, ON HIS DEATHBED, CALLS HIS SON TO HIM AND SAYS: “GO TO SAINT PETERSBURG AND MAKE YOURSELF MASTER OF THE CITY, FEAR NOTHING AND NO ONE, FOR GOD IS AN OLD HOG.”

SUCH AN ENORMITY IN MY FATHER’S MOUTH, FOR WHOM THE PRIESTHOOD WAS NOT A JOKE, IMPRESSED ME AS MUCH AS A CONFLAGRATION OR AN EARTHQUAKE. BUT I ALSO DISTINCTLY RECALL—THIS WAS OVER FIFTY YEARS AGO—THAT MY EMOTION WAS FOLLOWED BY A STRANGE, DARE I SAY A PERVERSE PLEASURE.



HAVING PENETRATED, IN THE COURSE OF YEARS, QUITE DEEPLY INTO TWO OR THREE RELIGIONS, I HAVE ALWAYS RETREATED ON THE THRESHOLD OF “CONVERSION,” LEST I LIE TO MYSELF. NONE OF THEM WAS, IN MY EYES, FREE ENOUGH TO ADMIT THAT VENGEANCE IS A NEED, THE MOST INTENSE AND PROFOUND OF ALL, AND THAT EACH MAN MUST SATISFY IT, IF ONLY IN WORDS. IF WE STIFLE THAT NEED, WE EXPOSE OURSELVES TO SERIOUS DISTURBANCES. MORE THAN ONE DISORDER—PERHAPS ALL DISORDERS—DERIVE FROM A VENGEANCE TOO LONG POSTPONED. WE MUST LEARN HOW TO EXPLODE! ANY DISEASE IS HEALTHIER THAN THE ONE PROVOKED BY A HOARDED RAGE.



PHILOSOPHY IN THE MORGUE. “MY NEPHEW WAS OBVIOUSLY A FAILURE. IF HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN MAKING SOMETHING OF HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE HAD A DIFFERENT ENDING THAN … THIS.” “YOU KNOW, MADAME,” I REPLIED TO THE MONUMENTAL MATRON WHO HAD ADDRESSED ME, “WHETHER ONE SUCCEEDS OR NOT COMES DOWN TO THE SAME THING.” “YOU’RE RIGHT,” SHE SAID, AFTER A FEW SECONDS’ THOUGHT. THIS UNEXPECTED ACQUIESCENCE ON THE PART OF SUCH A WOMAN MOVED ME ALMOST AS MUCH AS THE DEATH OF MY FRIEND.



MISFITS … IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEIR ADVENTURE, MORE THAN ANY OTHER, SHEDS A LIGHT ON THE FUTURE, THAT THEY ALONE ALLOW US TO GLIMPSE AND TO DECIPHER IT, AND THAT IF WE SET THEIR EXPLOITS ASIDE WE UTTERLY DISQUALIFY OURSELVES FROM DESCRIBING THE DAYS TO COME.



“A PITY,” YOU WERE SAYING, “THAT N HAS NEVER PRODUCED ANYTHING.”

“SO WHAT! HE EXISTS. IF HE HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO BOOKS, IF HE HAD HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO ‘REALIZE’ HIMSELF, WE WOULDN’T HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIM THE LAST HOUR.” THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING SOMEONE IS RARER THAN THAT OF CREATING. TO PRODUCE IS EASY; WHAT IS DIFFICULT IS TO SCORN THE USE OF ONE’S GIFTS.



FILMING A SCENE, THERE ARE COUNTLESS TAKES OF THE SAME INCIDENT. SOMEONE WATCHING IN THE STREET—OBVIOUSLY A PROVINCIAL—CAN’T GET OVER IT: “AFTER THIS, I’LL NEVER GO TO THE MOVIES AGAIN.”

ONE MIGHT REACT SIMILARLY WITH REGARD TO ANYTHING WHOSE UNDERSIDE ONE HAS SEEN, WHOSE SECRET ONE HAS SEIZED. YET, BY AN OBNUBILATION WHICH HAS SOMETHING OF THE MIRACULOUS ABOUT IT, THERE ARE GYNECOLOGISTS WHO ARE ATTRACTED TO THEIR PATIENTS, GRAVEDIGGERS WHO FATHER CHILDREN, INCURABLES WHO LAY PLANS, SKEPTICS WHO WRITE….



T, A RABBI’S SON, COMPLAINS THAT THIS AGE OF UNPRECEDENTED PERSECUTIONS HAS SEEN THE BIRTH OF NO ORIGINAL PRAYER CAPABLE OF BEING ADOPTED BY THE COMMUNITY AND UTTERED IN THE SYNAGOGUES. I ASSURE HIM THAT HE IS MISTAKEN TO BE DISTRESSED OR ALARMED BY THE FACT: THE GREAT DISASTERS YIELD NOTHING ON THE LITERARY OR RELIGIOUS LEVEL. ONLY THE SEMI-MISFORTUNES ARE FRUITFUL, BECAUSE THEY CAN BE, BECAUSE THEY ARE A POINT OF DEPARTURE, WHEREAS TOO PERFECT A HELL IS ALMOST AS STERILE AS PARADISE.



I WAS TWENTY. EVERYTHING WAS A BURDEN. ONE DAY I COLLAPSED ON A COUCH WITH AN “I CAN’T TAKE IT ANY LONGER.” MY MOTHER, ALREADY DRIVEN DISTRACTED BY MY SLEEPLESS NIGHTS, TOLD ME SHE HAD JUST HAD A MASS SAID FOR MY “REST.” NOT ONE BUT THIRTY THOUSAND, I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SHOUT AT HER, THINKING OF THE FIGURE CHARLES V INSCRIBED IN HIS WILL—FOR A MUCH LONGER REST, TRUE ENOUGH.



I RAN ACROSS HIM AGAIN, QUITE BY CHANCE, AFTER TWENTY-FIVE YEARS. UNCHANGED, INTACT, FRESHER THAN EVER, HE ACTUALLY SEEMS TO HAVE RETREATED TOWARD ADOLESCENCE.

WHERE HAS HE BEEN HIDING, AND WHAT HAS HE DONE TO ESCAPE THE ACTION OF THE YEARS, TO AVOID OUR WRINKLES AND GRIMACES? AND HOW HAS HE LIVED, IF IN FACT HE HAS LIVED AT ALL? ACTUALLY, A GHOST. HE MUST HAVE CHEATED, HE HAS NOT PERFORMED HIS DUTY AS A LIVING MAN, NOT PLAYED THE GAME. A GHOST, YES, AND A GATE-CRASHER. I DISCERN NO SIGN OF DESTRUCTION ON HIS COUNTENANCE, NONE OF THOSE MARKS WHICH TESTIFY THAT ONE IS A REAL BEING, AN INDIVIDUAL AND NOT AN APPARITION. WHAT CAN I SAY TO HIM? I FEEL AWKWARD, EMBARRASSED, EVEN AFRAID. SO GREATLY ARE WE UPSET BY ANYONE WHO ESCAPES TIME, OR MERELY DECEIVES IT.



D.C, WHO WAS WRITING HIS RECOLLECTIONS OF CHILDHOOD IN HIS RUMANIAN VILLAGE, HAVING TOLD HIS NEIGHBOR, A PEASANT NAMED COMAN, THAT HE WOULDN’T BE LEFT OUT, RECEIVED A VISIT FROM THE LATTER EARLY THE NEXT DAY: “I KNOW I’M A WORTHLESS MAN BUT ALL THE SAME I DIDN’T THINK I HAD FALLEN SO LOW AS TO BE TALKED ABOUT IN A BOOK.”

HOW SUPERIOR THE ORAL WORLD WAS TO OURS! BEINGS (I SHOULD SAY, PEOPLES) LIVE IN THE TRUTH ONLY AS LONG AS THEY HAVE A HORROR OF THE WRITTEN. ONCE THEY CATCH THE VIRUS, THEY ENTER THE INAUTHENTIC, THEY LOSE THEIR OLD SUPERSTITIONS TO ACQUIRE A NEW ONE, WORSE THAN ALL THE OTHERS COMBINED.



INCAPABLE OF GETTING UP, NAILED TO MY BED, I DRIFT WITH THE WHIMS OF MY MEMORY, AND I SEE MYSELF WANDERING, AS A CHILD, IN THE CARPATHIANS. ONE DAY I STUMBLED ON A DOG WHOSE MASTER, DOUBTLESS TO BE RID OF IT, HAD TIED IT TO A TREE; THE ANIMAL WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A SKELETON, SO DRAINED OF LIFE THAT IT BARELY HAD THE STRENGTH TO LOOK AT ME, WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO MOVE. YET IT WAS STANDING, THAT DOG….



A STRANGER COMES AND TELLS ME HE HAS KILLED SOMEONE. HE IS NOT WANTED BY THE POLICE BECAUSE NO ONE SUSPECTS HIM. I AM THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS HE IS THE KILLER. WHAT AM I TO DO? I LACK THE COURAGE AS WELL AS THE TREACHERY (FOR HE HAS ENTRUSTED ME WITH A SECRET—AND WHAT A SECRET!) TO TUM HIM IN. I FEEL I AM HIS ACCOMPLICE, AND RESIGN MYSELF TO BEING ARRESTED AND PUNISHED AS SUCH. AT THE SAME TIME, I TELL MYSELF THIS WOULD BE TOO RIDICULOUS. PERHAPS I SHALL GO AND DENOUNCE HIM ALL THE SAME. AND SO ON, UNTIL I WAKE UP.

THE INTERMINABLE IS THE SPECIALTY OF THE INDECISIVE. THEY CANNOT MARK LIFE OUT FOR THEIR OWN, AND STILL LESS THEIR DREAMS, IN WHICH THEY PERPETUATE THEIR HESITATIONS, PUSILLANIMITIES, SCRUPLES. THEY ARE IDEALLY QUALIFIED FOR NIGHTMARE.



A FILM ABOUT WILD ANIMALS: ENDLESS CRUELTY IN EVERY LATITUDE. “NATURE,” A TORTURER OF GENIUS, STEEPED IN HERSELF AND HER WORK, EXULTS WITH GOOD REASON: THERE IS NOT A MOMENT WHEN WHAT IS ALIVE FAILS TO TREMBLE, TO MAKE OTHERS TREMBLE. PITY IS A STRANGE LUXURY ONLY THE MOST PERFIDIOUS AND THE FIERCEST CREATURE COULD INVENT, OUT OF A NEED TO PUNISH AND TORTURE ITSELF—OUT OF FEROCITY, STILL.



ON A POSTER WHICH, AT A CHURCH DOOR, ANNOUNCES THE ART OF THE FUGUE, SOMEONE HAS SCRAWLED IN HUGE LETTERS: GOD IS DEAD. THIS APROPOS OF THE COMPOSER WHO TESTIFIES THAT GOD, IN THE EVENT OF HIS DECEASE, CAN REVIVE PRECISELY WHILE WE ARE LISTENING TO CERTAIN CANTATAS, CERTAIN FUGUES!



WE HAVE SPENT A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR TOGETHER. HE HAS USED THE TIME TO SHOW OFF, AND BY DINT OF TRYING TO SAY INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT HIMSELF, HAS SUCCEEDED. IF HE HAD MERELY SWAGGERED IN MODERATION, I SHOULD HAVE FOUND HIM A BORE AND LEFT IN A FEW MINUTES. BY EXAGGERATING, BY PLAYING THE PEACOCK TO PERFECTION, HE HAS COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO WIT TO SHOW SOME. THE DESIRE TO APPEAR SUBTLE DOES NOT DESTROY SUBTLETY. A MENTAL DEFECTIVE, IF HE COULD FEEL THE LONGING TO ASTONISH, WOULD MANAGE TO DECEIVE US—WOULD EVEN CATCH UP WITH INTELLIGENCE.



X, WHO IS OLDER THAN THE PATRIARCHS, AFTER INVEIGHING, DURING A LONG TÊTE-À-TÊTE, AGAINST THIS ONE AND THAT, TELLS ME: “THE GREAT WEAKNESS OF MY LIFE IS THAT I’VE NEVER HATED ANYONE.” OUR HATRED DOES NOT DIMINISH WITH THE YEARS: IN FACT, IT MOUNTS. THAT OF AN OLD MAN LIKE X ATTAINS INCREDIBLE PROPORTIONS: NOW INSENSITIVE TO HIS FORMER AFFECTIONS, HE PUTS ALL HIS FACULTIES AT THE SERVICE OF HIS RANCORS WHICH, MIRACULOUSLY REINVIGORATED, WILL SURVIVE THE CRUMBLING OF HIS MEMORY AND EVEN OF HIS REASON.

… THE DANGER OF FREQUENTING THE OLD IS THAT WHEN WE FIND THEM SO FAR FROM DETACHMENT AND SO INCAPABLE OF ESPOUSING IT, WE ARROGATE TO OURSELVES ALL THE ADVANTAGES THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE AND DO NOT. AND IT IS INEVITABLE THAT OUR REAL OR IMAGINARY ADVANCE UPON THEM IN MATTERS OF WEARINESS OR DISGUST SHOULD INCITE TO PRESUMPTION.



EVERY FAMILY HAS ITS OWN PHILOSOPHY. ONE OF MY COUSINS, WHO DIED YOUNG, ONCE WROTE ME: “IT’S ALL THE WAY IT’S ALWAYS BEEN AND PROBABLY ALWAYS WILL BE UNTIL THERE’S NOTHING LEFT ANY MORE.”

WHEREAS MY MOTHER ENDED THE LAST NOTE SHE EVER SENT ME WITH THIS TESTAMENTARY SENTENCE: “WHATEVER PEOPLE TRY TO DO, THEY’LL REGRET IT SOONER OR LATER.”

NOR CAN I EVEN BOAST OF HAVING ACQUIRED THIS VICE OF REGRET BY MY OWN SETBACKS. IT PRECEDES ME, IT PARTICIPATES IN THE PATRIMONY OF MY TRIBE. WHAT A LEGACY, SUCH UNFITNESS FOR ILLUSION!



A FEW KILOMETERS FROM THE VILLAGE WHERE I WAS BORN, THERE WAS A HAMLET, PERCHED ON A HILL AND INHABITED SOLELY BY GYPSIES. IN 1910 AN AMATEUR ETHNOLOGIST VISITED THE PLACE, ACCOMPANIED BY A PHOTOGRAPHER. HE MANAGED TO COLLECT THE INHABITANTS, WHO AGREED TO LET THEIR PICTURE BE TAKEN, WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THAT MEANT. AT THE INSTANT THEY WERE ASKED TO HOLD STILL, AN OLD WOMAN SHRIEKED: “WATCH OUT, THEY’RE STEALING OUR SOULS!” WHEREUPON THEY ALL FLUNG THEMSELVES UPON THE TWO VISITORS, WHO HAD THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY MAKING THEIR ESCAPE.

THESE HALF-SAVAGE GYPSIES—WHAT WERE THEY BUT INDIA, THEIR LAND OF ORIGIN WHICH, UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES, WAS SPEAKING THROUGH THEM?



IN CONTINUAL REBELLION AGAINST MY ANCESTRY, I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE WANTING TO BE SOMETHING ELSE: SPANISH, RUSSIAN, CANNIBAL—ANYTHING, EXCEPT WHAT I WAS. IT IS AN ABERRATION TO WANT TO BE DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU ARE, TO ESPOUSE IN THEORY ANY AND EVERY CONDITION, EXCEPT YOUR OWN.



THE DAY I READ THE LIST OF NEARLY ALL THE SANSKRIT WORDS THAT DESIGNATE THE ABSOLUTE, I REALIZED THAT I HAD TAKEN THE WRONG PATH, THE WRONG COUNTRY, THE WRONG IDIOM.



A FRIEND, AFTER I DON’T KNOW HOW MANY YEARS OF SILENCE, WRITES THAT SHE HASN’T MUCH LONGER TO LIVE, AND THAT SHE IS PREPARING TO “ENTER THE UNKNOWN….” THE CLICHÉ GIVES ME A START. I FIND IT HARD TO SEE WHAT ONE MIGHT ENTER BY DEATH. ANY AFFIRMATION, IN THIS REALM, SEEMS TO ME A DELUSION. DEATH IS NOT A STATE, PERHAPS NOT EVEN A TRANSITION. THEN WHAT IS IT? AND BY WHAT CLICHÉ, IN MY TURN, WILL I ANSWER MY FRIEND?



I MAY CHANGE MY OPINION ON THE SAME SUBJECT, THE SAME EVENT, TEN, TWENTY, THIRTY TIMES IN THE COURSE OF A SINGLE DAY. AND TO THINK THAT EACH TIME, LIKE THE WORST IMPOSTOR, I DARE UTTER THE WORD “TRUTH”!



HALE AND HEARTY STILL, THE WOMAN DRAGGED HER HUSBAND AFTER HER, A TALL, HUNCHED MAN, EYES STARING; SHE DRAGGED HIM AS IF HE HAD BEEN THE SURVIVOR OF ANOTHER AGE, AN APOPLECTIC AND SUPPLIANT DIPLODOCUS.

AN HOUR LATER, A SECOND ENCOUNTER: A NEATLY DRESSED OLD WOMAN, EXTREMELY STOOPED, “ADVANCED” TOWARD ME; HER BODY FORMING A PERFECT HALF CIRCLE, SHE NECESSARILY KEPT HER EYES ON THE GROUND, DOUBTLESS COUNTING HER UNIMAGINABLE SLOW TINY FOOTSTEPS. IT WAS AS IF SHE WERE LEARNING HOW TO WALK, AS IF SHE WERE AFRAID OF NOT KNOWING HOW AND WHERE TO PLACE HER FEET IN ORDER TO MOVE.

… EVERYTHING IS GOOD WHICH BRINGS ME CLOSER TO BUDDHA.



DESPITE HER WHITE HAIR, SHE STILL PARADED UP AND DOWN HER PART OF THE SIDEWALK, LOOKING FOR CUSTOMERS. I WOULD RUN INTO HER OFTEN, AT THREE IN THE MORNING, AND NEVER FELT LIKE GOING HOME UNTIL I HAD HEARD HER TELL A FEW ANECDOTES OR EXPLOITS. I HAVE FORGOTTEN ANECDOTES AND EXPLOITS ALIKE, BUT NOT THE READINESS WITH WHICH, ONE NIGHT WHEN I HAD BEGUN STORMING AGAINST ALL THE SLEEPING ‘VERMIN” OF PARIS, SHE BROKE IN WITH HER FOREFINGER POINTING TO HEAVEN AND: “WHAT ABOUT THE VERMIN UP THERE?’



“EVERYTHING IS WITHOUT BASIS, WITHOUT SUBSTANCE,” AND I NEVER REPEAT IT TO MYSELF WITHOUT FEELING SOMETHING LIKE HAPPINESS. UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SO MANY MOMENTS WHEN I FAIL TO REPEAT IT TO MYSELF.

I READ HIM FOR THE SHIPWRECKED FEELING I GET FROM ANYTHING HE WRITES. AT FIRST YOU FOLLOW, THEN YOU START GOING IN CIRCLES, THEN YOU ARE CAUGHT UP IN A KIND OF MILD UNMENACING WHIRLPOOL, AND YOU TELL YOURSELF YOU’RE SINKING, AND THEN YOU DO SINK. BUT YOU DON’T REALLY DROWN—THAT WOULD BE TOO EASY! YOU COME BACK UP TO THE SURFACE, YOU FOLLOW ALL OVER AGAIN, AMAZED TO SEE HE SEEMS TO BE SAYING SOMETHING AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS, AND THEN YOU START GOING ROUND AND ROUND AGAIN, AND YOU SINK ONCE MORE…. ALL OF WHICH IS MEANT TO BE PROFOUND, AND SEEMS SO. BUT ONCE YOU COME TO YOUR SENSES YOU REALIZE IT’S ONLY ABSTRUSE, OBSCURE, AND THAT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN REAL PROFUNDITY AND THE WILLED KIND IS AS GREAT AS BETWEEN A REVELATION AND A WHIM.



ANYONE WHO GIVES HIMSELF UP TO WRITING BELIEVES—WITHOUT REALIZING THE FACT—THAT HIS WORK WILL SURVIVE THE YEARS, THE AGES, TIME ITSELF. … IF HE FELT, WHILE HE WAS AT WORK ON IT, THAT IT WAS PERISHABLE, HE WOULD LEAVE OFF WHERE HE WAS, HE COULD NEVER FINISH. ACTIVITY AND CREDULITY ARE CORRELATIVE TERMS.



“LAUGHTER CEASED, AND AFTER LAUGHTER SMILES.” THIS APPARENTLY NAIVE REMARK BY A BIOGRAPHER OF ALEXSANDR BLOK DEFINES TO PERFECTION THE PROGRAM OF ANY AND EVERY DOWNFALL.



NO EASY MATTER, TO SPEAK OF GOD WHEN ONE IS NEITHER, A BELIEVER NOR AN ATHEIST: AND IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE DRAMA WE ALL SHARE, THEOLOGIANS INCLUDED—NO LONGER CAPABLE OF BEING EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER.



FOR A WRITER, PROGRESS TOWARD DETACHMENT AND DELIVERANCE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED DISASTER. HE, MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, NEEDS HIS DEFECTS: IF HE TRIUMPHS OVER THEM, HE IS LOST HE MUST BE CAREFUL, THEN, NOT TO IMPROVE, FOR IF HE SUCCEEDS, HE WILL REGRET IT BITTERLY.



WE MUST BEWARE OF WHATEVER INSIGHTS WE HAVE INTO OURSELVES. OUR SELF-KNOWLEDGE ANNOYS AND PARALYZES OUR DAIMON—THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD LOOK FOR THE REASON SOCRATES WROTE NOTHING.



WHAT MAKES BAD POETS WORSE IS THAT THEY READ ONLY POETS (JUST AS BAD PHILOSOPHERS READ ONLY PHILOSOPHERS), WHEREAS THEY WOULD BENEFIT MUCH MORE FROM A BOOK OF BOTANY OR GEOLOGY. WE ARE ENRICHED ONLY BY FREQUENTING DISCIPLINES REMOTE FROM OUR OWN. THIS IS TRUE, OF COURSE, ONLY FOR REALMS WHERE THE EGO IS RAMPANT.



TERTULLIAN TELLS US THAT IN ORDER TO BE CURED, EPILEPTICS WOULD GO “AND GREEDILY SUCK THE BLOOD OF CRIMINALS SLAUGHTERED IN THE ARENA.” IF I WERE TO HEED MY INSTINCT, THIS WOULD BE THE ONE TYPE OF MEDICATION, NO MATTER WHAT THE DISEASE, WHICH I WOULD ADOPT.



WHAT RIGHT HAVE WE TO BE ANNOYED BY SOMEONE WHO CALLS US A MONSTER? THE MONSTER IS UNIQUE BY DEFINITION, AND SOLITUDE, EVEN THE SOLITUDE OF INFAMY, SUPPOSES SOMETHING POSITIVE, A PECULIAR ELECTION, BUT UNDENIABLY AN ELECTION.



TWO ENEMIES—THE SAME MAN DIVIDED.



“NEVER JUDGE A MAN WITHOUT PUTTING YOURSELF IN HIS PLACE.” THIS OLD PROVERB MAKES ALL JUDGMENT IMPOSSIBLE, FOR WE JUDGE SOMEONE ONLY BECAUSE, IN FACT, WE CANNOT PUT OURSELVES IN HIS PLACE.



IF YOU LOVE YOUR INDEPENDENCE, YOU MUST LEND YOURSELF, IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT, TO EVERY TURPITUDE; YOU MUST RISK IGNOMINY ITSELF.



NOTHING MORE ABOMINABLE THAN THE CRITIC AND, A FORTIORI, THE PHILOSOPHER IN EACH OF US: IF I WERE A POET, I SHOULD BEHAVE LIKE DYLAN THOMAS, WHO, WHEN PEOPLE WOULD DISCUSS HIS POEMS IN HIS PRESENCE, WOULD DROP TO THE FLOOR IN A FIT OF CONVULSIONS.



ANYONE WHO BESTIRS HIMSELF COMMITS ONE INJUSTICE AFTER THE NEXT, WITHOUT A TRACE OF REMORSE. JUST BAD HUMOR. —REMORSE IS FOR THOSE WHO DO NOTHING, WHO CANNOT ACT. IT REPLACES ACTION FOR THEM, CONSOLES THEM FOR THEIR INEFIECTUALITY.



MOST OF OUR TROUBLES COME FROM OUR FIRST IMPULSES. THE SLIGHTEST ENTHUSIASM COSTS MORE THAN A CRIME.



SINCE WE REMEMBER CLEARLY ONLY OUR ORDEALS, IT IS ULTIMATELY THE SICK, THE PERSECUTED, THE VICTIMS IN EVERY REALM WHO WILL HAVE LIVED TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE. THE OTHERS—THE LUCKY ONES—HAVE A LIFE, OF COURSE, BUT NOT THE MEMORY OF A LIFE.



WHAT A BORE, SOMEONE WHO DOESN’T DEIGN TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION. VAIN PEOPLE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS ANNOYING, BUT THEY MAKE AN EFFORT, THEY TAKE THE TROUBLE: THEY ARE BORES WHO DON’T WANT TO BE BORES, AND WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THEM FOR THAT: WE END BY ENDURING THEM, EVEN BY SEEKING THEM OUT. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE TURN LIVID WITH FURY IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEONE WHO PAYS NO ATTENTION WHATEVER TO THE EFFECT HE MAKES. WHAT ARE WE TO SAY TO HIM, AND WHAT ARE WE TO EXPECT FROM HIM? EITHER KEEP SOME VESTIGES OF THE MONKEY, OR ELSE STAY HOME.



NOT THE FEAR OF EFFORT BUT THE FEAR OF SUCCESS EXPLAINS MORE THAN ONE FAILURE.



I’D LIKE TO PRAY WITH DAGGER-WORDS. UNFORTUNATELY, IF YOU PRAY AT ALL, YOU HAVE TO PRAY LIKE EVERYONE ELSE. WHEREIN ABIDES ONE OF THE GREATEST DIFFICULTIES OF FAITH.



WE DREAD THE FUTURE ONLY WHEN WE ARE NOT SURE WE CAN KILL OURSELVES WHEN WE WANT TO.



NEITHER BOSSUET, NOR MALEBRANCHE, NOR FÉNELON DEIGNED TO MENTION THE PENSÉES: APPARENTLY PASCAL DIDN’T STRIKE THEM AS SUFFICIENTLY SERIOUS.



FEAR IS THE ANTIDOTE TO BOREDOM: THE REMEDY MUST BE STRONGER THAN THE DISEASE.



IF ONLY I COULD REACH THE LEVEL OF THE MAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE! BUT SOME POWER, INCREASING YEAR BY YEAR, DRAWS ME DOWN. EVEN TO GET BACK UP TO MY SURFACE, I HAVE TO EMPLOY STRATAGEMS I CANNOT THINK OF WITHOUT BLUSHING.



THERE WAS A TIME WHEN, IN ORDER TO DISPEL ANY IMPULSE OF VENGEANCE ONCE I HAD ENDURED SOME AFFRONT, I WOULD IMAGINE MYSELF QUITE STILL IN MY GRAVE. AND I CALMED DOWN AT ONCE. WE MUST NOT DESPISE OUR CORPSE TOO MUCH: IT CAN BE USEFUL ON OCCASION.



EVERY THOUGHT DERIVES FROM A THWARTED SENSATION.



THE ONLY WAY TO REACH ANOTHER PERSON AT ANY DEPTH IS TO MOVE TOWARD WHAT IS DEEPEST IN YOURSELF. IN OTHER WORDS, TO TAKE THE OPPOSITE PATH FROM THE ONE FOLLOWED BY SO-CALLED GENEROUS MINDS.



IF ONLY I COULD SAY WITH THAT HASIDIC RABBI: “THE BLESSING OF MY LIFE IS THAT I HAVE NEVER NEEDED A THING BEFORE I POSSESSED IT!”



IN PERMITTING MAN, NATURE HAS COMMITTED MUCH MORE THAN A MISTAKE IN HER CALCULATIONS: A CRIME AGAINST HERSELF.



FEAR CREATES CONSCIOUSNESS—NOT NATURAL FEAR BUT MORBID FEAR. OTHERWISE ANIMALS WOULD HAVE ACHIEVED A LEVEL OF CONSCIOUSNESS HIGHER THAN OURS.



AS ORANGUTANG IN THE STRICT SENSE OF THE WORD, MAN IS OLD; AS HISTORICAL ORANGUTANG, HE IS COMPARATIVELY RECENT: A PARVENU WHO HAS NOT HAD TIME TO LEARN HOW TO BEHAVE IN LIFE.



AFTER CERTAIN EXPERIENCES, WE SHOULD CHANGE NAMES, SINCE WE OURSELVES ARE NO LONGER THE SAME. EVERYTHING ASSUMES ANOTHER ASPECT, STARTING WITH DEATH. WHICH SEEMS CLOSE AND DESIRABLE: WE ARE RECONCILED TO IT, AND WE REACH THE POINT OF CALLING IT “MAN’S BEST FRIEND,” AS MOZART DOES IN A LETTER TO HIS DYING FATHER.



WE MUST SUFFER TO THE END, TO THE MOMENT WHEN WE STOP BELIEVING IN SUFFERING.



“TRUTH REMAINS HIDDEN TO THE MAN FILLED WITH DESIRE AND HATRED” (BUDDHA)…. WHICH IS TO SAY, TO EVERY MAN ALIVE.



WON OVER BY SOLITUDE, YET HE REMAINS IN THE WORLD: A STYLITE WITHOUT A PILLAR.



“YOU WERE WRONG TO COUNT ON ME.” WHO CAN SPEAK IN SUCH TERMS? GOD AND THE FAILURE.



EVERYTHING WE ACHIEVE, EVERYTHING THAT COMES OUT OF US, ASPIRES TO FORGET ITS ORIGINS, AND SUCCEEDS ONLY BY OPPOSING US. HENCE THE NEGATIVE SIGN THAT MARKS ALL OUR SUCCESSES.



THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY ABOUT ANYTHING. SO THERE CAN BE NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF BOOKS.



FAILURE, EVEN REPEATED, ALWAYS SEEMS FRESH; WHEREAS SUCCESS, MULTIPLIED, LOSES ALL INTEREST, ALL ATTRACTION. IT IS NOT MISFORTUNE BUT HAPPINESS—INSOLENT HAPPINESS, IT IS TRUE—WHICH LEADS TO RANCOR AND SARCASM.



“AN ENEMY IS AS USEFUL AS A BUDDHA.” EXACTLY, FOR OUR ENEMY WATCHES OVER US, KEEPS US FROM LETTING OURSELVES GO. BY INDICATING, BY DIVULGING OUR LEAST WEAKNESS, HE LEADS US STRAIGHT TO OUR SALVATION, MOVES HEAVEN AND EARTH TO KEEP US FROM BEING UNWORTHY OF HIS IMAGE OF US. HENCE OUR GRATITUDE TO HIM SHOULD BE BOUNDLESS.



WE GET A BETTER HOLD OF OURSELVES AND OF BEING WHEN WE HAVE REACTED AGAINST NEGATING, DISSOLVING BOOKS—AGAINST THEIR NOXIOUS POWER. FORTIFYING BOOKS, ACTUALLY, SINCE THEY PROVOKE THE VERY ENERGY WHICH DENIES THEM. THE MORE POISON THEY CONTAIN, THE MORE SALUTARY THEIR EFFECT, PROVIDED WE READ THEM AGAINST THE GRAIN, AS WE SHOULD READ ANY BOOK, STARTING WITH THE CATECHISM.



THE GREATEST FAVOR WE CAN DO AN AUTHOR IS TO FORBID HIM TO WORK DURING A CERTAIN PERIOD. SHORT-TERM TYRANNIES ARE NECESSARY—PROHIBITIONS WHICH WOULD SUSPEND ALL INTELLECTUAL ACTIVITY. UNINTERRUPTED FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION EXPOSES TALENT TO A DEADLY DANGER, FORCES IT BEYOND ITS MEANS AND KEEPS IT FROM STOCKPILING SENSATIONS AND EXPERIENCES. UNLIMITED FREEDOM IS A CRIME AGAINST THE MIND.



SELF-PITY IS NOT SO STERILE AS WE SUPPOSE. ONCE WE FEEL ITS MERE ONSET, WE ASSUME A THINKER’S ATTITUDE, AND COME TO THINK OF IT, WE COME TO THINK!



THE STOIC’S MAXIM, ACCORDING TO WHICH WE SHOULD SUBMIT UNCOMPLAININGLY TO THINGS WHICH DO NOT DEPEND ON OURSELVES, TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ONLY EXTERNAL MISFORTUNES, WHICH ESCAPE OUR WILL. BUT HOW TO ACCOMMODATE OURSELVES TO THOSE WHICH COME FROM OURSELVES? IF WE ARE THE SOURCE OF OUR ILLS, WHOM ARE WE TO CONFRONT? OURSELVES? WE MANAGE, LUCKILY, TO FORGET THAT WE ARE THE GUILTY PARTIES, AND MOREOVER EXISTENCE IS TOLERABLE ONLY IF WE DAILY RENEW THIS LIE, THIS ACT OF OBLIVION.



ALL MY LIFE, I HAVE LIVED WITH THE FEELING THAT I HAVE BEEN KEPT FROM MY TRUE PLACE. IF THE EXPRESSION “METAPHYSICAL EXILE” HAD NO MEANING, MY EXISTENCE ALONE WOULD AFFORD IT ONE.



THE MORE GIFTED A MAN IS, THE LESS PROGRESS HE MAKES ON THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL. TALENT IS AN OBSTACLE TO THE INNER LIFE.



TO SAVE THE WORD “GRANDEUR” FROM OFFICIALDOM, WE SHOULD USE IT ONLY APROPOS OF INSOMNIA OR HERESY.



IN CLASSICAL INDIA, THE SAGE AND THE SAINT WERE COMBINED IN ONE AND THE SAME PERSON. TO HAVE ANY NOTION OF SUCH A SUCCESS, WE MUST IMAGINE, IF WE CAN, A FUSION BETWEEN RESIGNATION AND ECSTASY, BETWEEN A COLD STOIC AND A DISHEVELED MYSTIC.



BEING IS SUSPECT. THEN WHAT IS TO BE SAID OF “LIFE,” WHICH IS ITS DEVIATION AND STIGMA?



WHEN SOMEONE TELLS US OF AN UNFAVORABLE OPINION ABOUT OURSELVES, INSTEAD OF BEING DISTRESSED, WE SHOULD THINK OF ALL THE “EVIL” WE HAVE SPOKEN OF OTHERS, AND REALIZE THAT IT IS ONLY JUSTICE THAT AS MUCH SHOULD BE SAID OF OURSELVES. IRONICALLY, NO ONE IS MORE VULNERABLE, MORE SUSCEPTIBLE, AND LESS LIKELY TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIS OWN DEFECTS THAN THE BACKBITER. MERELY TELL HIM ABOUT THE SLIGHTEST RESERVATION SOMEONE HAS MADE IN HIS REGARD, AND HE WILL LOSE COUNTENANCE, LOSE HIS TEMPER, AND DROWN IN HIS OWN BILE.



SEEN FROM THE OUTSIDE, HARMONY REIGNS IN EVERY SECT, CLAN, AND PARTY; SEEN FROM THE INSIDE, DISCORD. CONFLICTS IN A MONASTERY ARE AS FREQUENT AND AS ENVENOMED AS IN ANY SOCIETY. EVEN WHEN THEY DESERT HELL, MEN DO SO ONLY TO RECONSTRUCT IT ELSEWHERE.



THE LEAST CONVERSION IS EXPERIENCED AS AN ADVANCE. FORTUNATELY THERE EXIST EXCEPTIONS.

ONE OF MY FAVORITES IS THAT EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY JEWISH SECT IN WHICH MEN WENT OVER TO CHRISTIANITY IN ORDER TO DEBASE THEMSELVES; AND ANOTHER IS THAT SOUTH AMERICAN INDIAN WHO, UPON CONVERSION, LAMENTED THAT HE MUST NOW BECOME THE PREY OF WORMS INSTEAD OF BEING EATEN BY HIS CHILDREN, AN HONOR HE WOULD HAVE ENJOYED HAD HE NOT ABJURED HIS TRIBE’S BELIEFS.



ONLY NORMAL THAT MAN SHOULD NO LONGER BE INTERESTED IN RELIGION BUT IN RELIGIONS, FOR ONLY THROUGH THEM WILL HE BE IN A POSITION TO UNDERSTAND THE MANY VERSIONS OF HIS SPIRITUAL COLLAPSE.



WHEN WE RECAPITULATE THE STAGES OF OUR CAREER, IT IS HUMILIATING TO REALIZE THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD THE DISASTERS WE DESERVED, THE ONES WE WERE ENTITLED TO EXPECT.



IN SOME MEN, THE PROSPECT OF A MORE OR LESS IMMINENT END EXCITES ENERGY, GOOD OR BAD, AND PLUNGES THEM INTO A FRENZY OF ACTIVITY. ARTLESS ENOUGH TO TRY TO PERPETUATE THEMSELVES BY THEIR ENDEAVOR, BY THEIR WORK, THEY MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO FINISH, TO CONCLUDE IT: NOT A MOMENT TO LOSE.

THE SAME PERSPECTIVE INVITES OTHERS TO FOUNDER IN WHAT’S-THE-USE, IN A STAGNANT CLEAR-SIGHTEDNESS, IN THE UNIMPEACHABLE TRUTHS OF DESPOND.



“MY CURSE ON THE MAN WHO, IN FUTURE EDITIONS OF MY WORKS, KNOWINGLY CHANGES ANYTHING—A SENTENCE, OR ONLY A WORD, A SYLLABLE, A LETTER, A PUNCTUATION MARK!” IS IT THE PHILOSOPHER OR THE WRITER IN SCHOPENHAUER WHO SPEAKS THIS WAY? BOTH AT ONCE, AND THIS CONJUNCTION (WHEN WE THINK OF THE AWFUL STYLE OF ANY PHILOSOPHICAL WORK) IS EXTREMELY RARE. IT IS NOT A HEGEL WHO WOULD HAVE UTTERED SUCH A CURSE. NOR ANY OTHER MAJOR PHILOSOPHER, EXCEPT PLATO.



NOTHING MORE AGGRAVATING THAN A SEAMLESS, UNREMITTING IRONY WHICH LEAVES YOU NO TIME TO BREATHE AND STILL LESS TO THINK; WHICH INSTEAD OF BEING INCONSPICUOUS, OCCASIONAL, IS MASSIVE, AUTOMATIC, AT THE ANTIPODES OF ITS ESSENTIALLY DELICATE NATURE. WHICH IN ANY CASE IS HOW IT IS USED IN GERMANY, A NATION WHICH, HAVING MEDITATED UPON IT THE MOST, IS LEAST CAPABLE OF WIELDING IT.



ANXIETY IS NOT PROVOKED: IT TRIES TO FIND A JUSTIFICATION FOR ITSELF, AND IN ORDER TO DO SO SEIZES UPON ANYTHING, THE VILEST PRETEXTS, TO WHICH IT CLINGS ONCE IT HAS INVENTED THEM. A REALITY WHICH PRECEDES ITS PARTICULAR EXPRESSIONS, ITS VARIETIES, ANXIETY PROVOKES ITSELF, ENGENDERS ITSELF, IT IS “INFINITE CREATION,” AND AS SUCH IS MORE LIKELY TO SUGGEST THE WORKINGS OF THE DIVINITY THAN THOSE OF THE PSYCHE.



AUTOMATIC MELANCHOLY: AN ELEGIAC ROBOT.



AT A GRAVE, THE WORDS: GAME, IMPOSTURE, JOKE, DREAM, COME TO MIND. IMPOSSIBLE TO THINK THAT EXISTENCE IS A SERIOUS PHENOMENON. CERTAINTY OF FAKING FROM THE START, AT BOTTOM. OVER THE GATE OF OUR CEMETERIES SHOULD BE WRITTEN: “NOTHING IS TRAGIC. EVERYTHING IS UNREAL.”



I SHALL NOT SOON FORGET THE EXPRESSION OF HORROR ON WHAT WAS HIS FACE, THE DREAD, THE EXTREME SUFFERING, AND THE AGGRESSION. NO, HE WAS NOT HAPPY. NEVER HAVE I SEEN A MAN SO UNCOMFORTABLE IN HIS COFFIN.



LOOK NEITHER AHEAD NOR BEHIND, LOOK INTO YOURSELF, WITH NEITHER FEAR NOR REGRET. NO ONE DESCENDS INTO HIMSELF SO LONG AS HE REMAINS A SLAVE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FUTURE.



INELEGANT TO REPROACH A MAN FOR HIS STERILITY, WHEN THAT IS HIS POSTULATE, HIS MODE OF ACHIEVEMENT, HIS DREAM….



NIGHTS WHEN WE HAVE SLEPT ARE AS IF THEY HAD NEVER BEEN. THE ONLY ONES THAT REMAIN IN OUR MEMORY ARE THE ONES WHEN WE COULDN’T CLOSE OUR EYES: NIGHT MEANS SLEEPLESS NIGHT.



IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE TO RESOLVE THEM, I HAVE TURNED ALL MY PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES INTO THEORETICAL ONES. FACED WITH THE INSOLUBLE, I BREATHE AT LAST….



TO A STUDENT WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I STOOD WITH REGARD TO THE AUTHOR OF ZARATHUSTRA, I REPLIED THAT I HAD LONG SINCE STOPPED READING HIM. WHY? “I FIND HIM TOO NAÏVE….”

I HOLD HIS ENTHUSIASMS, HIS FERVORS AGAINST HIM. HE DEMOLISHED SO MANY IDOLS ONLY TO REPLACE THEM WITH OTHERS: A FALSE ICONOCLAST, WITH ADOLESCENT ASPECTS AND A CERTAIN VIRGINITY, A CERTAIN INNOCENCE INHERENT IN HIS SOLITARY’S CAREER. HE OBSERVED MEN ONLY FROM A DISTANCE. HAD HE COME CLOSER, HE COULD HAVE NEITHER CONCEIVED NOR PROMULGATED THE SUPERMAN, THAT PREPOSTEROUS, LAUGHABLE, EVEN GROTESQUE CHIMERA, A CROTCHET WHICH COULD OCCUR ONLY TO A MIND WITHOUT TIME TO AGE, TO KNOW THE LONG SERENE DISGUST OF DETACHMENT.

MARCUS AURELIUS IS MUCH CLOSER TO ME. NOT A MOMENT’S HESITATION BETWEEN THE LYRICISM OF FRENZY AND THE PROSE OF ACCEPTANCE: I FIND MORE COMFORT, MORE HOPE EVEN, IN THE WEARY EMPEROR THAN IN THE THUNDERING PROPHET.

APPEALING, THAT HINDU NOTION OF ENTRUSTING OUR SALVATION TO SOMEONE ELSE, TO A CHOSEN “SAINT,” AND PERMITTING HIM TO PRAY IN OUR PLACE, TO DO ANYTHING IN ORDER TO SAVE US. SELLING OUR SOUL TO GOD….



“DOES TALENT HAVE ANY NEED OF PASSIONS? YES, OF MANY PASSIONS—REPRESSED” (JOUBERT). NOT ONE MORALIST WE CANNOT CONVERT INTO A PRECURSOR OF FREUD.



IT IS ALWAYS SURPRISING TO DISCOVER THAT THE GREAT MYSTICS PRODUCED SO MUCH, THAT THEY LEFT SO MANY TREATISES. UNDOUBTEDLY THEIR INTENTION WAS TO CELEBRATE GOD AND NOTHING ELSE. THIS IS TRUE IN PART, BUT ONLY IN PART.

WE DO NOT CREATE A BODY OF WORK WITHOUT ATTACHING OURSELVES TO IT, WITHOUT SUBJUGATING OURSELVES TO IT. WRITING IS THE LEAST ASCETIC OF ALL ACTIONS.



WHEN I LIE AWAKE FAR INTO THE NIGHT, I AM VISITED BY MY EVIL GENIUS, AS BRUTUS WAS BY HIS BEFORE THE BATTLE OF PHILIPPI.



“DO I LOOK LIKE SOMEONE WHO HAS SOMETHING TO DO HERE ON EARTH?” —THAT’S WHAT I’D LIKE TO ANSWER THE BUSYBODIES WHO INQUIRE INTO MY ACTIVITIES.



IT HAS TEEN SAID THAT A METAPHOR “MUST BE ABLE TO TE DRAWN.” WHATEVER IS ORIGINAL AND LASTING IN LITERATURE FOR AT LOST A CENTURY CONTRADICTS THIS REMARK. FOR IF ANYTHING HAS OUTLIVED ITS USEFULNESS IT IS “COHERENT” METAPHOR, ONE WITH EXPLICIT CONTOURS. IT IS AGAINST SUCH METAPHOR THAT POETRY HAS UNCEASINGLY REBELLED, TO THE POINT WHERE A DEAD POETRY IS A POETRY AFFLICTED WITH COHERENCE.



LISTENING TO THE WEATHER REPORT, I FEEL A STRONG RESPONSE TO THE WORDS “SCATTERED RAIN.” WHICH CERTAINLY PROVES THAT POETRY IS IN OURSELVES AND NOT IN THE EXPRESSION, THOUGH SCATTERED IS AN ADJECTIVE CAPABLE OF SETTING UP A CERTAIN VIBRATION.



ONCE I FORMULATE A DOUBT, OR MORE EXACTLY, ONCE I FEEL THE NEED TO FORMULATE A DOUBT, I EXPERIENCE A CURIOUS, DISTURBING WELL-BEING. IT WOULD BE FAR EASIER FOR ME TO LIVE WITHOUT A TRACE OF BELIEF THAN WITHOUT A TRACE OF DOUBT. DEVASTING DOUBT, NOURISHING DOUBT!



THERE IS NO FAKE SENSATION.



WITHDRAW INTO YOURSELF, PERCEIVE THERE A SILENCE AS OLD AS BEING, EVEN OLDER….



IF I DETEST MAN, I COULD NOT SAY WITH THE SAME CASE: I DETEST THE HUMAN BEING, FOR IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING THERE IS SOMETHING MORE, SOMETHING ENIGMATIC AND ENGAGING IN THAT WORD BEING WHICH SUGGESTS QUALITIES ALIEN TO THE IDEA OF MAN.



IN THE DHAMMAPADA, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT, IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE DELIVERANCE, WE MUST BE RID OF THE DOUBLE YOKE OF GOOD AND EVIL. THAT GOOD ITSELF SHOULD BE ONE OF OUR FETTERS WE ARE TOO SPIRITUALLY RETARDED TO BE ABLE TO ADMIT. AND SO WE SHALL NOT BE DELIVERED.



EVERYTHING TURNS ON PAIN; THE REST IS ACCESSORY, EVEN NONEXISTENT, FOR WE REMEMBER ONLY WHAT HURTS. PAINFUL SENSATIONS BEING THE ONLY REAL ONES, IT IS VIRTUALLY USELESS TO EXPERIENCE OTHERS.



I BELIEVE WITH THAT MADMAN CALVIN THAT WE ARE PREDESTINED TO SALVATION OR DAMNATION IN OUR MOTHER’S WOMB. WE HAVE ALREADY LIVED OUR LIFE BEFORE BEING BORN.



A FREE MAN IS ONE WHO HAS DISCERNED THE INANITY OF ALL POINTS OF VIEW; A LIBERATED MAN IS ONE WHO HAS DRAWN THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH DISCERNMENT.



WE HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER, AND WHILE I WAS MANUFACTURING MY PHRASES I FELT THAT THE EARTH WAS FALLING THROUGH SPACE AND THAT I WAS FALLING WITH IT AT A SPEED THAT MADE ME DIZZY.



YEARS AND YEARS TO WAKEN FROM THAT SLEEP IN WHICH THE OTHERS LOLL; THEN YEARS AND YEARS TO ESCAPE THAT AWAKENING …



A TASK TO BE DONE, SOMETHING I HAVE UNDERTAKEN OUT OF NECESSITY OR CHOICE: NO SOONER HAVE I STARTED IN THAN EVERYTHING SEEMS IMPORTANT, EVERYTHING ATTRACTS ME, EXCEPT THAT.



THINK ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVEN’T LONG TO LIVE, WHO KNOW THAT EVERYTHING IS OVER AND DONE WITH, EXCEPT THE TIME IN WHICH THE THOUGHT OF THEIR END UNROLLS. DEAL WITH THAT TIME. WRITE FOR GLADIATORS….



EROSION OF OUR BEING BY OUR INFIRMITIES: THE RESULTING VOID IS FILLED BY THE PRESENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, WHAT AM I SAYING?—THAT VOID IS CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF.



MORAL DISINTEGRATION WHEN WE SPEND TIME IN A PLACE THAT IS TOO BEAUTIFUL: THE SELF DISSOLVES UPON CONTACT WITH PARADISE. NO DOUBT IT WAS TO AVOID THIS DANGER THAT THE FIRST MAN MADE THE CHOICE HE DID.



ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, THERE HAVE TEEN MORE AFFIRMATIONS THAN NEGATIONS—AT LEAST TILL NOW. SO WE MAY DENY WITHOUT REMORSE. BELIEFS WILL ALWAYS WEIGH MORE IN THE SCALES.



THE SUBSTANCE OF A WORK IS THE IMPOSSIBLE—WHAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ATTAIN, WHAT COULD NOT TE GIVEN TO US: THE SUM OF ALL THE THINGS WHICH WERE REFUSED US.



GOGOL, IN HOPES OF A “REGENERATION,” JOURNEYS TO NAZARETH AND DISCOVERS HE IS AS BORED THERE AS “IN A RUSSIAN RAILROAD STATION”—THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO US ALL WHEN WE LOOK OUTSIDE OURSELVES FOR WHAT CAN EXIST ONLY INSIDE.



KILL YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ARE WHAT YOU ARE, YES, BUT NOT BECAUSE ALL HUMANITY WOULD SPIT IN YOUR FACE!



WHY FEAR THE NOTHING IN STORE FOR US WHEN IT IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE NOTHING WHICH PRECEDED US: THIS ARGUMENT OF THE ANCIENTS AGAINST THE FEAR OF DEATH IS UNACCEPTABLE AS CONSOLATION. BEFORE, WE HAD THE LUCK NOT TO EXIST; NOW WE EXIST, AND IT IS THIS PARTICLE OF EXISTENCE, HENCE OF MISFORTUNE, WHICH DREADS DEATH. PARTICLE IS NOT THE WORD, SINCE EACH OF US PREFERS HIMSELF TO THE UNIVERSE, AT ANY RATE CONSIDERS HIMSELF EQUAL TO IT.



WHEN WE DISCERN THE UNREALITY OF EVERYTHING, WE OURSELVES BECOME UNREAL, WE BEGIN TO SURVIVE OURSELVES, HOWEVER POWERFUL OUR VITALITY, HOWEVER IMPERIOUS OUR INSTINCTS. BUT THEY ARE NO LONGER ANYTHING BUT FALSE INSTINCTS, AND FALSE VITALITY.



IF YOU ARE DOOMED TO DEVOUR YOURSELF, NOTHING CAN KEEP YOU FROM IT: A TRIFLE WILL IMPEL YOU AS MUCH AS A TRAGEDY. RESIGN YOURSELF TO EROSION AT ALL TIMES: YOUR FATE WILLS IT SO.



TO LIVE IS TO LOSE GROUND.



TO THINK THAT SO MANY HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DYING!



IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO RESENT THOSE WHO WRITE US OVERWHELMING LETTERS.



IN A REMOTE PROVINCE OF INDIA, EVERYTHING WAS EXPLAINED BY DREAMS, AND WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT, DREAMS WERE USED TO CURE DISEASES AS WELL. IT WAS ACCORDING TO DREAMS THAT BUSINESS WAS CONDUCTED AND MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH DECIDED. UNTIL THE ENGLISH CAME. SINCE THEN, ONE NATIVE SAID, “WE NO LONGER DREAM.”

IN WHAT WE HAVE AGREED TO CALL “CIVILIZATION,” THERE RESIDES, UNDENIABLY, A DIABOLIC PRINCIPLE MAN HAS BECOME CONSCIOUS OF TOO LATE, WHEN IT WAS NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO REMEDY IT.



LUCIDITY WITHOUT THE CORRECTIVE OF AMBITION LEADS TO STAGNATION. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE ONE SUSTAIN THE OTHER, THAT THE ONE COMBAT THE OTHER WITHOUT WINNING, FOR A WORK, FOR A LIFE TO BE POSSIBLE.



WE CANNOT FORGIVE THOSE WE HAVE PRAISED TO THE SKIES, WE ARE IMPATIENT TO BREAK WITH THEM, TO SNAP THE MOST DELICATE CHAIN OF ALL: THE CHAIN OF ADMIRATION …, NOT OUT OF INSOLENCE, BUT OUT OF AN ASPIRATION TO FIND OUR BEARINGS, TO BE FREE, TO BE … OURSELVES. WHICH WE MANAGE ONLY BY AN ACT OF INJUSTICE.



THE PROBLEM OF RESPONSIBILITY WOULD HAVE A MEANING ONLY IF WE HAD BEEN CONSULTED BEFORE OUR BIRTH AND HAD CONSENTED TO BE PRECISELY WHO WE ARE.



THE ENERGY AND VIRULENCE OF MY TAEDIUM VITAE CONTINUE TO ASTOUND ME. SO MUCH VIGOR IN A DISEASE SO DECREPIT! TO THIS PARADOX I OWE MY PRESENT INCAPACITY TO CHOOSE MY FINAL HOUR.



FOR OUR ACTIONS, FOR OUR VITALITY ITSELF, THE CLAIM TO LUCIDITY IS AS RUINOUS AS LUCIDITY ITSELF.



CHILDREN TURN, AND MUST TURN, AGAINST THEIR PARENTS, AND THE PARENTS CAN DO NOTHING ABOUT IT, FOR THEY ARE SUBJECT TO A LAW WHICH DECREES THE RELATIONS AMONG ALL THE LIVING: I.E., THAT EACH ENGENDERS HIS OWN ENEMY.



SO CAREFULLY HAVE WE BEEN TAUGHT TO CLING TO THINGS THAT WHEN WE WOULD BE FREE OF THEM, WE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT. AND IF DEATH DID NOT COME TO OUR AID, OUR STUBBORNNESS IN SUBSISTING WOULD MAKE US FIND A RECIPE FOR EXISTENCE BEYOND WEARING OUT, BEYOND SENILITY ITSELF



EVERYTHING IS WONDERFULLY CLEAR IF WE ADMIT THAT BIRTH IS A DISASTROUS OR AT LEAST AN INOPPORTUNE EVENT; BUT IF WE THINK OTHERWISE, WE MUST RESIGN OURSELVES TO THE UNINTELLIGIBLE, OR ELSE CHEAT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.



IN A GNOSTIC WORK OF THE SECOND CENTURY OF OUR ERA, WE READ: “THE PRAYER OF A MELANCHOLY MAN WILL NEVER HAVE THE STRENGTH TO RISE UNTO GOD.” … SINCE MAN PRAYS ONLY IN DESPONDENCY, WE MAY DEDUCE THAT NO PRAYER HAS EVER REACHED ITS DESTINATION.



HE WAS ABOVE ALL OTHERS, AND HAD HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT: HE HAD SIMPLY FORGOTTEN TO DESIRE….



IN ANCIENT CHINA, WOMEN SUFFERING FROM ANGER OR GRIEF WOULD CLIMB ONTO PLATFORMS SPECIALLY CONSTRUCTED FOR THEM IN THE STREET, AND THERE WOULD GIVE FREE REIN TO THEIR FURY OR THEIR LAMENTATIONS. SUCH CONFESSIONALS SHOULD BE REVIVED AND ADOPTED THE WORLD OVER, IF ONLY TO REPLACE THE OBSOLETE ONES OF THE CHURCH, OR THE INEFFECTUAL ONES OF VARIOUS THERAPEUTICS.



THIS PHILOSOPHER LACKS KEEPING OR, TO USE THE JARGON, “INTERNAL FORM.” HE IS TOO FABRICATED TO BE ALIVE OR EVEN “REAL”—A SINISTER PUPPET. WHAT BLISS TO KNOW I SHALL NEVER OPEN HIS BOOKS AGAIN!



NO ONE EXCLAIMS HE IS FEELING WELL AND THAT HE IS FREE, YET THIS IS WHAT ALL WHO KNOW THIS DOUBLE BLESSING SHOULD DO. NOTHING CONDEMNS US MORE THAN OUR INCAPACITY TO SHOUT OUR GOOD LUCK.



TO HAVE FAILED IN EVERYTHING, ALWAYS, OUT OF A LOVE OF DISCOURAGEMENT!



THE SOLE MEANS OF PROTECTING YOUR SOLITUDE IS TO OFFEND EVERYONE, BEGINNING WITH THOSE YOU LOVE.



A BOOK IS A POSTPONED SUICIDE.



SAY WHAT WE WILL, DEATH IS THE BEST THING NATURE HAS FOUND TO PLEASE EVERYONE. WITH EACH OF US, EVERYTHING VANISHES, EVERYTHING STOPS FOREVER. WHAT AN ADVANTAGE, WHAT AN ABUSE! WITHOUT THE LEAST EFFORT ON OUR PART, WE OWN THE UNIVERSE, WE DRAG IT INTO OUR OWN DISAPPEARANCE. NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, DYING IS IMMORAL. …

IF INSTEAD OF EXPANDING YOU, PUTTING YOU IN A STATE OF ENERGETIC EUPHORIA, YOUR ORDEALS DEPRESS AND EMBITTER YOU, YOU CAN BE SURE YOU HAVE NO SPIRITUAL VOCATION.



TO LIVE IN EXPECTATION, TO COUNT ON THE FUTURE OR ON A SIMULACRUM OF THE FUTURE: WE ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO IT THAT WE HAVE CONCEIVED THE IDEA OF IMMORTALITY ONLY OUT OF A NEED TO WAIT OUT ETERNITY.



EVERY FRIENDSHIP IS AN INCONSPICUOUS DRAMA, A SERIES OF SUBTLE WOUNDS.



LUTHER DEAD BY LUCAS FORTNAGEL. A PLEBEIAN, AGGRESSIVE, TERRIFYING MASK, AS OF SOME SUBLIME HOG … WHICH PERFECTLY RENDERS THE FEATURES OF THE MAN WE CANNOT SUFFICIENTLY PRAISE FOR HAVING DECLARED: “DREAMS ARE LIARS; IF YOU SHIT IN YOUR BED, THAT’S TRUE.”



THE MORE YOU LIVE, THE LESS USEFUL IT SEEMS TO HAVE LIVED.



AT TWENTY, THOSE NIGHTS WHEN FOR HOURS AT A TIME I WOULD STAND, FOREHEAD PRESSED AGAINST THE PANE, STARING INTO THE DARK….



NO AUTOCRAT WIELDS A POWER COMPARABLE TO THAT ENJOYED BY A POOR DEVIL PLANNING TO KILL HIMSELF.



EDUCATING YOURSELF NOT TO LEAVE TRACES IS A MOMENT-BY-MOMCNT WAR AGAINST YOURSELF, SOLELY TO PROVE THAT YOU COULD, IF YOU CHOSE, BECOME A SAGE….



TO EXIST IS A STATE AS LITTLE CONCEIVABLE AS ITS CONTRARY. NO, STILL MORE INCONCEIVABLE.



IN ANTIQUITY, “BOOKS” WERE SO COSTLY THAT ONE COULD NOT ACCUMULATE THEM UNLESS ONE WAS A KING, A TYRANT, OR … ARISTOTLE, THE FIRST TO POSSESS A LIBRARY WORTHY OF THE NAME.

ONE MORE INCRIMINATING ITEM IN THE DOSSIER OF A PHILOSOPHER ALREADY SO CATASTROPHIC IN SO MANY REGARDS.



IF I WERE TO CONFORM TO MY MOST INTIMATE CONVICTIONS, I SHOULD CEASE TO TAKE ANY ACTION WHATEVER, TO REACT IN ANY WAY. BUT I AM STILL CAPABLE OF SENSATIONS….



A MONSTER, HOWEVER HORRIBLE, SECRETLY ATTRACTS US, PURSUES US, HAUNTS US. HE REPRESENTS, ENLARGED, OUR ADVANTAGES AND OUR MISERIES, HE PROCLAIMS US, HE IS OUR STANDARD-BEARER.



OVER THE CENTURIES, MAN HAS SLAVED TO BELIEVE, PASSING FROM DOGMA TO DOGMA, ILLUSION TO ILLUSION, AND HAS GIVEN VERY LITTLE TIME TO DOUBTS, SHORT INTERVALS BETWEEN HIS EPOCHS OF BLINDNESS. INDEED THEY WERE NOT DOUBTS BUT PAUSES, MOMENTS OF RESPITE FOLLOWING THE FATIGUE OF FAITH, OF ANY FAITH.



INNOCENCE BEING THE PERFECT STATE, PERHAPS THE ONLY ONE, IT IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE THAT A MAN ENJOYING IT SHOULD SEEK TO LEAVE IT. YET HISTORY FROM ITS BEGINNINGS DOWN TO OURSELVES IS ONLY THAT AND NOTHING BUT THAT.



I DRAW THE CURTAINS, AND I WAIT. ACTUALLY, I AM NOT WAITING FOR ANYTHING, I AM MERELY MAKING MYSELF ABSENT. SCOURED, IF ONLY FOR A FEW MINUTES, OF THE IMPURITIES WHICH DIM AND CLOG THE MIND, I ACCEDE TO A STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS FROM WHICH THE SELF IS EVACUATED, AND I AM AS SOOTHED AS IF I WERE RESTING OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSE.



IN ONE MEDIEVAL EXORCISM, ALL THE PARTS OF THE BODY, EVEN THE SMALLEST, ARE LISTED FROM WHICH THE DEMON IS ORDERED TO DEPART: A KIND OF LUNATIC ANATOMY TREATISE, FASCINATING FOR ITS HYPERTROPHY OF PRECISION, ITS PROFUSION OF UNEXPECTED DETAILS. A SCRUPULOUS INCANTATION. LEAVE THE NAILS! FANATIC BUT NOT WITHOUT POETIC EFFECT. FOR AUTHENTIC POETRY HAS NOTHING IN COMMON WITH “POETRY.”



IN ALL OUR DREAMS, EVEN IF THEY DEAL WITH THE FLOOD, THERE IS ALWAYS, IF ONLY FOR A FRACTION OF A SECOND, SOME MINUSCULE INCIDENT WE WITNESSED THE DAY BEFORE. THIS REGULARITY, WHICH I HAVE VERIFIED FOR YEARS, IS THE ONLY CONSTANT, THE ONLY LAW OR SEMBLANCE OF LAW I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISCERN IN NIGHT’S INCREDIBLE CHAOS.



THE DISSOLVING POWER OF CONVERSATION. ONE REALIZES WHY BOTH MEDITATION AND ACTION REQUIRE SILENCE.



THE CERTAINTY OF BEING ONLY AN ACCIDENT HAS ACCOMPANIED ME ON ALL OCCASIONS, PROPITIOUS OR INJURIOUS, AND IF IT HAS SAVED ME FROM THE TEMPTATION TO BELIEVE MYSELF NECESSARY, IT HAS NOT ON THE OTHER HAND ENTIRELY CURED ME OF A CERTAIN VAINGLORY INHERENT IN THE LOSS OF ILLUSIONS.



RARE TO COME UPON A FREE MIND, AND WHEN YOU DO, YOU REALIZE THAT THE BEST OF SUCH A MIND IS NOT REVEALED IN ITS WORKS (WHEN WE WRITE WE BEAR, MYSTERIOUSLY, CHAINS) BUT IN THOSE CONFIDENCES WHERE, RELEASED FROM CONVICTION AND POSE, AS FROM ALL CONCERN WITH RIGOR OR STANDING, IT DISPLAYS ITS WEAKNESSES. AND WHERE IT BEHAVES AS A HERETIC TO ITSELF.



IF THE FOREIGNER IS NOT A CREATOR IN THE MATTER OF LANGUAGE, IT IS BECAUSE HE WANTS TO DO AS WELL AS THE NATIVES: WHETHER OR NOT HE SUCCEEDS, THIS AMBITION IS HIS DOWNFALL.



I BEGIN A LETTER OVER AND OVER AGAIN, I GET NOWHERE: WHAT TO SAY AND HOW TO SAY IT? I DON’T EVEN REMEMBER WHOM I WAS WRITING TO. ONLY PASSION OR PROFIT FIND AT ONCE THE RIGHT TONE. UNFORTUNATELY DETACHMENT IS INDIFFERENCE TO LANGUAGE, INSENSITIVITY TO WORDS. YET IT IS BY LOSING CONTACT WITH WORDS THAT WE LOSE CONTACT WITH HUMAN BEINGS.



EVERYONE HAS HAD, AT A GIVEN MOMENT, AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE WHICH WILL BE FOR HIM, BECAUSE OF THE MEMORY OF IT HE PRESERVES, THE CRUCIAL OBSTACLE TO HIS INNER METAMORPHOSIS.



I KNOW PEACE ONLY WHEN MY AMBITIONS SLEEP. ONCE THEY WAKEN, ANXIETY REPOSSESSES ME. LIFE IS A STATE OF AMBITION. THE MOLE DIGGING HIS TUNNELS IS AMBITIOUS. AMBITION IS IN EFFECT EVERYWHERE, AND WE SEE ITS TRACES ON THE FACES OF THE DEAD THEMSELVES.



GOING TO INDIA BECAUSE OF THE VEDANTA OR BUDDHISM IS ABOUT THE SAME AS GOING TO FRANCE BECAUSE OF JANSENISM. MOREOVER THE LATTER IS MORE RECENT, SINCE IT VANISHED ONLY THREE CENTURIES AGO.



NOT THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF REALITY ANYWHERE—EXCEPT IN MY SENSATIONS OF UNREALITY.



EXISTENCE WOULD BE A QUITE IMPRACTICABLE ENTERPRISE IF WE STOPPED GRANTING IMPORTANCE TO WHAT HAS NONE.



WHY DOCS THE GITA RANK “RENUNCIATION OF THE FRUIT OF ACTIONS” SO HIGH? BECAUSE SUCH RENUNCIATION IS RARE, IMPRACTICABLE, CONTRARY TO OUR NATURE, AND BECAUSE ACHIEVING IT IS DESTROYING THE MAN ONE HAS BEEN AND ONE IS, KILLING IN ONESELF THE ENTIRE PAST, THE WORK OF MILLENNIA—IN A WORD, FREEING ONESELF OF THE SPECIES, THAT HIDEOUS AND IMMEMORIAL RIFFRAFF.



WE SHOULD HAVE ABIDED BY OUR LARVAL CONDITION, DISPENSED WITH EVOLUTION, REMAINED INCOMPLETE, DELIGHTING IN THE ELEMENTAL SIESTA AND CALMLY CONSUMING OURSELVES IN AN EMBRYONIC ECSTASY.



TRUTH ABIDES IN THE INDIVIDUAL DRAMA. IF I SUFFER AUTHENTICALLY, I SUFFER MUCH MORE THAN AN INDIVIDUAL, I TRANSCEND THE SPHERE OF MY SELFHOOD, I REJOIN THE ESSENCE OF OTHERS. THE ONLY WAY TO PROCEED TOWARD THE UNIVERSAL IS TO CONCERN OURSELVES EXCLUSIVELY WITH WHAT CONCERNS OURSELVES.



WHEN WE ARE FIXATED ON DOUBT, WE TAKE MORE PLEASURE IN LAVISHING SPECULATIONS UPON IT THAN IN PRACTICING IT.



IF YOU WANT TO KNOW A NATION, FREQUENT ITS SECOND-ORDER WRITERS: THEY ALONE REFLECT ITS TRUE NATURE. THE OTHERS DENOUNCE OR TRANSFIGURE THE NULLITY OF THEIR COMPATRIOTS, AND NEITHER CAN NOR WILL PUT THEMSELVES ON THE SAME LEVEL. THEY ARE SUSPECT WITNESSES.



IN MY YOUTH THERE WOULD BE WEEKS DURING WHICH I NEVER CLOSED MY EYES. I LIVED IN THE UNLIVED WORLD, I HAD THE SENSE THAT TIME, WITH ALL ITS MOMENTS, HAD CONCENTRATED ITSELF WITHIN ME, WHERE IT CULMINATED, WHERE IT TRIUMPHED. I MOVED IT ONWARD, OF COURSE, I WAS ITS PROMOTER AND BEARER, ITS CAUSE AND SUBSTANCE, AND IT WAS AS AN AGENT AND ACCOMPLICE THAT I PARTICIPATED IN ITS APOTHEOSIS. WHEN SLEEP DEPARTS FROM US, THE UNHEARD-OF BECOMES EVERYDAY, EASY: WE ENTER IT WITHOUT PREPARATIONS, INHABIT IT, WALLOW IN IT.



ASTOUNDING, THE NUMBER OF HOURS I HAVE WASTED ON ? THE “MEANING” OF WHAT EXISTS, OF WHAT HAPPENS…. BUT THAT “WHAT” HAS NO MEANING, AS ALL SERIOUS MINDS KNOW. HENCE THEY DEVOTE THEIR TIME AND THEIR ENERGY TO MORE USEFUL UNDERTAKINGS.



MY AFFINITIES WITH RUSSIAN BYRONISM, FROM PECHORIN TO STAVRO-GIN, MY BOREDOM AND MY PASSION FOR BOREDOM.



X, WHOM I DO NOT PARTICULARLY APPRECIATE, WAS TELLING A STORY SO STUPID THAT I WAKENED WITH A START: THOSE WE DON’T LIKE RARELY SHINE IN OUR DREAMS.



FOR LACK OF OCCUPATION, THE OLD SEEM TO BE TRYING TO SOLVE SOMETHING VERY COMPLICATED, DEVOTING TO IT ALL THE CAPACITIES THEY STILL POSSESS. PERHAPS THIS IS WHY THEY DO NOT COMMIT SUICIDE EN MASSE, AS THEY OUGHT WERE THEY EVEN A TRIFLE LESS ABSORBED.



LOVE AT ITS MOST IMPASSIONED DOES NOT BRING TWO HUMAN BEINGS SO CLOSE TOGETHER AS CALUMNY. INSEPARABLE, SLANDERER AND SLANDERED CONSTITUTE A “TRANSCENDENT” UNITY, FOREVER WELDED ONE TO THE OTHER. NOTHING CAN SEPARATE THEM. ONE INFLICTS HARM, THE OTHER ENDURES IT, BUT IF HE ENDURES IT, IT IS BECAUSE HE IS ACCUSTOMED TO DOING SO, CAN NO LONGER DO WITHOUT IT, EVEN INSISTS UPON IT. HE KNOWS THAT HIS WISHES WILL BE GRATIFIED, THAT HE WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN, THAT WHATEVER HAPPENS HE WILL BE ETERNALLY PRESENT IN THE MIND OF HIS INDEFATIGABLE BENEFACTOR.



THE MONK-ERRANT, THE WANDERING FRIAR—SO FAR, THE SUPREME ACHIEVEMENT. TO REACH THE POINT OF NO LONGER HAVING ANYTHING TO RENOUNCE! SUCH MUST BE THE DREAM OF ANY DISABUSED MIND.



SOBBING NEGATION—THE ONLY TOLERABLE FORM OF NEGATION.



LUCKY JOB, WHO WAS NOT OBLIGED TO ANNOTATE HIS LAMENTATIONS!



LATE AT NIGHT I FEEL LIKE FALLING INTO A FRENZY, DOING SOME UNPRECEDENTED THING TO RELEASE MYSELF, BUT I DON’T SEE AGAINST WHOM, AGAINST WHAT …



MME D’HEUDICOURT, SAINT-SIMON OBSERVES, HAD NEVER SPOKEN GOOD OF ANYONE IN HER LIFE WITHOUT ADDING SOME CRUSHING “BUT’S.” A WONDERFUL DEFINITION, NOT OF BACKBITING BUT OF CONVERSATION IN GENERAL.



EVERYTHING THAT LIVES MAKES NOISE. WHAT AN ARGUMENT FOR THE MINERAL KINGDOM!



BACH WAS QUARRELSOME, LITIGIOUS, SELF-SERVING, GREEDY FOR TITLES AND HONORS, ETC. SO WHAT! A MUSICOLOGIST LISTING THE CANTATAS WHOSE THEME IS DEATH HAS REMARKED THAT NO MORTAL EVER HAD SUCH A NOSTALGIA FOR IT. WHICH IS ALL THAT COUNTS. THE REST HAS TO DO WITH BIOGRAPHY.



THE MISFORTUNE OF BEING INCAPABLE OF NEUTRAL STATES EXCEPT BY REFLECTION AND EFFORT. WHAT AN IDIOT ACHIEVES AT THE OUTSET, WE MUST STRUGGLE NIGHT AND DAY TO ATTAIN, AND ONLY BY FITS AND STARTS!



I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED WITH THE VISION OF A HOST OF MOMENTS MARCHING AGAINST ME. TIME WILL HAVE BEEN MY BIRNAM WOOD.



PAINFUL OR WOUNDING QUESTIONS ASKED BY THE UNCOUTH DISTRESS AND ANGER US, AND MAY HAVE THE SAME EFFECT AS CERTAIN TECHNIQUES OF ORIENTAL MEDITATION. WHO KNOWS IF A DENSE, AGGRESSIVE STUPIDITY MIGHT NOT PROVOKE ILLUMINATION? IT IS CERTAINLY WORTH AS MUCH AS A RAP ON THE HEAD WITH A STICK.



KNOWLEDGE IS NOT POSSIBLE, AND EVEN IF IT WERE, WOULD SOLVE NOTHING. SUCH IS THE DOUBTER’S POSITION. WHAT DOES HE WANT, THEN—WHAT IS HE LOOKING FOR? NEITHER HE NOR ANYONE WILL EVER KNOW. SKEPTICISM IS THE RAPTURE OF IMPASSE.



BESIEGED BY OTHERS, I TRY TO MAKE MY ESCAPE, WITHOUT MUCH SUCCESS, IT MUST BE CONFESSED. YET I MANAGE TO WANGLE MYSELF, DAY BY DAY, A FEW SECONDS’ AUDIENCE WITH THE MAN I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE.



BY A CERTAIN AGE, WE SHOULD CHANGE NAMES AND HIDE OUT SOMEWHERE, LOST TO THE WORLD, IN NO DANGER OF SEEING FRIENDS OR ENEMIES AGAIN, LEADING THE PEACEFUL LIFE OF AN OVERWORKED MALEFACTOR.



WE CANNOT REFLECT AND BE MODEST. ONCE THE MIND IS SET TO WORK, IT REPLACES GOD AND ANYTHING ELSE. IT IS INDISCRETION, ENCROACHMENT, PROFANATION. IT DOES NOT BUILD, IT DISLOCATES. THE TENSION ITS METHODS BETRAY REVEALS ITS BRUTAL, IMPLACABLE CHARACTER: WITHOUT A GOOD DOSE OF FEROCITY, WE COULD NOT FOLLOW A THOUGHT TO ITS CONCLUSION.



MOST SUBVERTERS, VISIONARIES, AND SAVIORS HAVE BEEN EITHER EPILEPTICS OR DYSPEPTICS. THERE IS UNANIMITY AS TO THE VIRTUES OF EPILEPSY; GASTRIC UPHEAVALS ARE REGARDED, ON THE OTHER HAND, AS LESS MERITORIOUS. YET NOTHING IS MORE CONDUCIVE TO SUBVERSION THAN A DIGESTION WHICH REFUSES TO BE FORGOTTEN.



MY MISSION IS TO SUFFER FOR ALL THOSE WHO SUFFER WITHOUT KNOWING IT. I MUST PAY FOR THEM, EXPIATE THEIR UNCONSCIOUSNESS, THEIR LUCK TO BE IGNORANT OF HOW UNHAPPY THEY ARE.



EACH TIME TIME TORMENTS ME, I TELL MYSELF THAT ONE OF US MUST BACK DOWN, THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS CRUEL CONFRONTATION TO GO ON INDEFINITELY.



WHEN WE ARE IN THE DEPTHS OF DEPRESSION, EVERYTHING WHICH FEEDS IT, AFFORDS IT FURTHER SUBSTANCE, ALSO RAISES IT TO A LEVEL WHERE WE CAN NO LONGER FOLLOW AND THEREBY RENDERS IT TOO GREAT, EXCESSIVE: SCARCELY SURPRISING THAT WE SHOULD REACH THE POINT OF NO LONGER REGARDING IT AS OUR OWN.



A FORETOLD MISFORTUNE, WHEN AT LAST IT OCCURS, IS TEN, IS A HUNDRED TIMES HARDER TO ENDURE THAN ONE WE DID NOT EXPECT. ALL DURING OUR APPREHENSIONS, WE LIVED THROUGH IT IN ADVANCE, AND WHEN IT HAPPENS THESE PAST TORMENTS ARE ADDED TO THE PRESENT ONES, AND TOGETHER THEY FORM A MASS WHOSE WEIGHT IS INTOLERABLE.



OBVIOUSLY GOD WAS A SOLUTION, AND OBVIOUSLY NONE SO SATISFACTORY WILL EVER BE FOUND AGAIN.



I SHALL NEVER UTTERLY ADMIRE ANYONE EXCEPT A MAN DISHONORED—AND HAPPY. THERE IS A MAN, I SHOULD SAY, WHO DEFIES THE OPINION OF HIS FELLOWS AND WHO FINDS CONSOLATION AND HAPPINESS IN HIMSELF ALONE.



THE MAN OF THE RUBICON, AFTER PHARSALUS, HAD FORGIVEN TOO MANY. SUCH MAGNANIMITY SEEMED OFFENSIVE TO THOSE OF HIS FRIENDS WHO HAD BETRAYED HIM AND WHOM HE HAD HUMILIATED BY TREATING THEM WITHOUT RANCOR. THEY FELT DIMINISHED, FLOUTED, AND PUNISHED HIM FOR HIS CLEMENCY OR FOR HIS DISDAIN: HE HAD REFUSED TO STOOP TO RESENTMENT! HAD HE BEHAVED AS A TYRANT, THEY WOULD HAVE SPARED HIM. BUT THEY COULD NOT FORGIVE HIM, SINCE HE HAD NOT DEIGNED TO FRIGHTEN THEM ENOUGH.



EVERYTHING THAT IS ENGENDERS, SOONER OR LATER, NIGHTMARES. LET US TRY, THEREFORE, TO INVENT SOMETHING BETTER THAN BEING.



PHILOSOPHY, WHICH HAD MADE IT ITS BUSINESS TO UNDERMINE BELIEFS, WHEN IT SAW CHRISTIANITY SPREADING AND ON THE POINT OF PREVAILING, MADE COMMON CAUSE WITH PAGANISM, WHOSE SUPERSTITIONS SEEMED PREFERABLE TO THE TRIUMPHANT INSANITIES. BY ATTACKING AND DEMOLISHING THE GODS, PHILOSOPHY HAD INTENDED TO FREE MEN’S MINDS; IN REALITY, IT HANDED THEM OVER TO A NEW SERVITUDE, WORSE THAN THE OLD ONE, FOR THE GOD WHO WAS TO REPLACE THE GODS HAD NO PARTICULAR WEAKNESS FOR EITHER TOLERANCE OR IRONY.

PHILOSOPHY, IT WILL BE OBJECTED, IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADVENT OF THIS GOD, INDEED THIS WAS NOT THE GOD PHILOSOPHY RECOMMENDED. NO DOUBT, BUT IT SHOULD HAVE SUSPECTED THAT WE DO NOT SUBVERT THE GODS WITH IMPUNITY, THAT OTHERS WOULD COME TO TAKE THEIR PLACE, AND THAT IT HAD NOTHING TO GAIN BY THE EXCHANGE.



FANATICISM IS THE DEATH OF CONVERSATION. WE DO NOT GOSSIP WITH A CANDIDATE FOR MARTYRDOM. WHAT ARE WE TO SAY TO SOMEONE WHO REFUSES TO PENETRATE OUR REASONS AND WHO, THE MOMENT WE DO NOT BOW TO HIS, WOULD RATHER DIE THAN YIELD? GIVE US DILETTANTES AND SOPHISTS, WHO AT LEAST ESPOUSE ALL REASONS….



WE INVEST OURSELVES WITH AN ABUSIVE SUPERIORITY WHEN WE TELL SOMEONE WHAT WE THINK OF HIM AND OF WHAT HE DOES. FRANKNESS IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH A DELICATE SENTIMENT, NOR EVEN WITH AN ETHICAL EXIGENCY.



MORE THAN ALL OTHERS, OUR RELATIVES ARE READY TO DOUBT OUR MERITS. IT IS A UNIVERSAL RULE: BUDDHA HIMSELF DID NOT ESCAPE IT—ONE OF HIS COUSINS OPPOSED HIM THE MOST, AND ONLY AFTERWARD MARA, THE DEVIL.



FOR THE VICTIM OF ANXIETY, THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUCCESS AND FIASCO. HIS REACTION TO THE ONE IS THE SAME AS TO THE OTHER: BOTH TROUBLE HIM EQUALLY.



WHEN I TORMENT MYSELF A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR NOT WORKING, I TELL MYSELF THAT I MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE DEAD AND THAT THEN I WOULD BE WORKING STILL LESS….



RATHER IN A GUTTER THAN ON A PEDESTAL.



THE ADVANTAGES OF A STATE OF ETERNAL POTENTIALITY SEEM TO ME SO CONSIDERABLE THAT WHEN I BEGIN LISTING THEM, I CAN’T GET OVER THE FACT THAT THE TRANSITION TO BEING COULD EVER HAVE OCCURRED.



EXISTENCE = TORMENT. THE EQUATION SEEMS OBVIOUS TO ME, BUT NOT TO ONE OF MY FRIENDS. HOW TO CONVINCE HIM? I CANNOT LEND HIM MY SENSATIONS; YET ONLY THEY WOULD HAVE THE POWER TO PERSUADE HIM, TO GIVE HIM THAT ADDITIONAL DOSE OF ILL-BEING HE HAS SO INSISTENTLY ASKED FOR ALL THIS TIME.



IF WE SEE THINGS BLACK, IT IS BECAUSE WE WEIGH THEM IN THE DARK, BECAUSE THOUGHTS ARE GENERALLY THE FRUIT OF SLEEPLESSNESS, CONSEQUENTLY OF DARKNESS. THEY CANNOT ADAPT TO LIFE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN THOUGHT WITH A VIEW TO LIFE. THE NOTION OF THE CONSEQUENCES THEY MIGHT INVOLVE DOESN’T EVEN OCCUR TO THE MIND. WE ARE BEYOND ALL HUMAN CALCULATION, BEYOND ANY NOTION OF SALVATION OR PERDITION, OF BEING OR NON-BEING, WE ARE IN A PARTICULAR SILENCE, A SUPERIOR MODALITY OF THE VOID.



NOT YET TO HAVE DIGESTED THE AFFRONT OF BEING BORN.



TO EXPEND ONESELF IN CONVERSATIONS AS MUCH AS AN EPILEPTIC IN HIS FITS.



IN ORDER TO CONQUER PANIC OR SOME TENACIOUS ANXIETY, THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IMAGINING YOUR OWN BURIAL. AN EFFECTIVE METHOD, READILY AVAILABLE TO ALL IN ORDER NOT TO HAVE TO RESORT TO IT TOO OFTEN IN THE COURSE OF A DAY, BEST TO EXPERIENCE ITS BENEFIT STRAIGHT OFF, WHEN YOU GET UP. OR ELSE USE IT ONLY AT EXCEPTIONAL MOMENTS, LIKE POPE INNOCENT IX, WHO, HAVING COMMISSIONED A PAINTING IN WHICH HE WAS SHOWN ON HIS DEATHBED, GLANCED AT IT EACH TIME HE HAD TO MAKE SOME IMPORTANT DECISION.



THERE IS NO NEGATOR WHO IS NOT FAMISHED FOR SOME CATASTROPHIC YES.



WE MAY BE SURE THAT MAN WILL NEVER REACH DEPTHS COMPARABLE TO THOSE HE KNEW DURING THE AGES OF EGOISTIC COLLOQUY WITH BIS GOD.



NOT ONE MOMENT WHEN I AM NOT EXTERNAL TO THE UNIVERSE! … NO SOONER HAVE I LAMENTED OVER MYSELF, PITYING MY WRETCHED CONDITION, THAN I REALIZE THAT THE TERMS IN WHICH I DESCRIBED MY MISFORTUNE WERE PRECISELY THOSE WHICH DEFINE THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC OF THE “SUPREME BEING.”



ARISTOTLE, AQUINAS, HEGEL—THREE ENSLAVERS OF THE MIND. THE WORST FORM OF DESPOTISM IS THE SYSTEM, IN PHILOSOPHY AND IN EVERYTHING.



GOD IS WHAT SURVIVES THE EVIDENCE THAT NOTHING DESERVES TO BE THOUGHT.



WHEN I WAS YOUNG, NO PLEASURE COMPARED WITH THE PLEASURE OF MAKING ENEMIES. NOW, WHENEVER I MAKE ONE, MY FIRST THOUGHT IS TO BE RECONCILED, SO THAT I WON’T HAVE TO BOTHER ABOUT HIM. HAVING ENEMIES IS A HEAVY RESPONSIBILITY. MY BURDEN IS SUFFICIENT, I NO LONGER CAN CARRY THAT OF OTHERS AS WELL.



JOY IS A LIGHT WHICH DEVOURS ITSELF, INEXHAUSTIBLY; IT IS THE SUN EARLY ON.



A FEW DAYS BEFORE HE DIED, CLAUDEL REMARKED THAT WE SHOULD NOT CALL GOD INFINITE BUT INEXHAUSTIBLE. AS IF IT DID NOT COME DOWN TO THE SAME THING, OR JUST ABOUT! ALL THE SAME, THIS CONCERN FOR EXACTITUDE, THIS VERBAL SCRUPLE AT THE MOMENT THAT HE WAS WRITING THAT HIS “LEASE” ON LIFE HAD NEARLY EXPIRED, IS MORE INSPIRING THAN A “SUBLIME” WORD OR GESTURE.



THE UNUSUAL IS NOT A CRITERION. PAGANINI IS MORE SURPRISING AND MORE UNPREDICTABLE THAN BACH.



WE SHOULD REPEAT TO OURSELVES, EVERY DAY: I AM ONE OF THE BILLIONS DRAGGING HIMSELF ACROSS THE EARTH’S SURFACE. ONE, AND NO MORE. THIS BANALITY JUSTIFIES ANY CONCLUSION, ANY BEHAVIOR OR ACTION: DEBAUCHERY, CHASTITY, SUICIDE, WORK, CRIME, SLOTH, OR REBELLION, … WHENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT EACH MAN IS RIGHT TO DO WHAT HE DOES.



TSIMTSUM. THIS SILLY-SOUNDING WORD DESIGNATES A MAJOR CONCEPT OF THE CABBALA. FOR THE WORLD TO EXIST, GOD, WHO WAS EVERYTHING AND EVERYWHERE, CONSENTED TO SHRINK, TO LEAVE A VACANT SPACE NOT INHABITED BY HIMSELF: IT IS IN THIS “HOLE” THAT THE WORLD OCCURRED.

THUS WE OCCUPY THE WASTELAND HE CONCEDED TO US OUT OF PITY OR WHIM. FOR US TO EXIST, HE CONTRACTED, HE LIMITED HIS SOVEREIGNTY. WE ARE THE PRODUCT OF HIS VOLUNTARY REDUCTION, OF HIS EFFACEMENT, OF HIS PARTIAL ABSENCE. IN HIS MADNESS HE HAS ACTUALLY AMPUTATED HIMSELF FOR US. IF ONLY HE HAD HAD THE GOOD SENSE AND THE GOOD TASTE TO REMAIN WHOLE!



IN THE “GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THE EGYPTIANS,” JESUS PROCLAIMS: “MEN WILL BE THE VICTIMS OF DEATH SO LONG AS WOMEN GIVE BIRTH.” AND HE SPECIFIES: “I AM COME TO DESTROY THE WORKS OF WOMAN.”

WHEN WE FREQUENT THE EXTREME TRUTHS OF THE GNOSTICS, WE SHOULD LIKE TO GO, IF POSSIBLE, STILL FURTHER, TO SAY SOMETHING NEVER SAID, WHICH PETRIFIES OR PULVERIZES HISTORY, SOMETHING OUT OF A COSMIC NERONIANISM, OUT OF A MADNESS ON THE SCALE OF MATTER.



TO EXPRESS AN OBSESSION IS TO PROJECT IT OUTSIDE YOURSELF, TO HUNT IT DOWN, TO EXORCISE IT. OBSESSIONS ARE THE DEMONS OF A WORLD WITHOUT FAITH.



MAN ACCEPTS DEATH BUT NOT THE HOUR OF HIS DEATH. TO DIE ANY TIME, EXCEPT WHEN ONE HAS TO DIE!



ONCE WE STEP INTO A CEMETERY, A FEELING OF UTTER MOCKERY DOES AWAY WITH ANY METAPHYSICAL CONCERN. THOSE WHO LOOK FOR “MYSTERY” EVERYWHERE DO NOT NECESSARILY GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THINGS. MOST OFTEN “MYSTERY,” LIKE “THE ABSOLUTE,” CORRESPONDS ONLY TO A MANNERISM OF THE MIND. IT IS A WORD WE SHOULD USE ONLY WHEN WE CANNOT DO OTHERWISE, IN REALLY DESPERATE CASES.



IF I RECAPITULATE MY PLANS WHICH HAVE REMAINED PLANS AND THOSE WHICH HAVE WORKED OUT, I HAVE EVERY REASON TO REGRET THAT THESE LATTER HAVE NOT SUFFERED THE FATE OF THE FORMER.



“HE WHO IS INCLINED TO LUST IS MERCIFUL AND TENDER-HEARTED; THOSE WHO ARE INCLINED TO PURITY ARE NOT SO” (SAINT JOHN CLIMACUS). IT TOOK A SAINT, NEITHER MORE NOR LESS, TO DENOUNCE SO DISTINCTLY AND SO VIGOROUSLY NOT THE LIES BUT THE VERY ESSENCE OF CHRISTIAN MORALITY, AND INDEED OF ALL MORALITY.



WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO ACCEPT THE NOTION OF AN UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP; ON THE OTHER HAND AN ETERNAL AWAKENING (IMMORTALITY, IF IT WERE CONCEIVABLE, WOULD BE JUST THAT) PLUNGES US INTO DREAD. UNCONSCIOUSNESS IS A COUNTRY, A FATHERLAND; CONSCIOUSNESS, AN EXILE.



ANY PROFOUND IMPRESSION IS VOLUPTUOUS OR FUNEREAL—OR BOTH AT ONCE.



NO ONE HAS BEEN SO CONVINCED AS I OF THE FUTILITY OF EVERYTHING; AND NO ONE HAS TAKEN SO TRAGICALLY SO MANY FUTILE THINGS.



ISHI, THE LAST AMERICAN INDIAN OF HIS TRIBE, AFTER HIDING FOR YEARS IN TERROR OF THE WHITE MEN, REDUCED TO STARVATION, SURRENDERED OF HIS OWN FREE WILL TO THE EXTERMINATORS OF HIS PEOPLE, BELIEVING THAT THE SAME TREATMENT WAS IN STORE FOR HIMSELF. HE WAS MADE MUCH OF. HE HAD NO POSTERITY, HE WAS TRULY THE LAST.

ONCE HUMANITY IS DESTROYED OR SIMPLY EXTINGUISHED, WE MAY IMAGINE A SOLE SURVIVOR WHO WOULD WANDER THE EARTH, WITHOUT EVEN HAVING ANYONE TO SURRENDER TO….



DEEP IN HIS HEART, MAN ASPIRES TO REJOIN THE CONDITION HE HAD BEFORE CONSCIOUSNESS. HISTORY IS MERELY THE DETOUR HE TAKES TO GET THERE.



ONLY ONE THING MATTERS: LEARNING TO BE THE LOSER.



EVERY PHENOMENON IS A CORRUPT VERSION OF ANOTHER, LARGER PHENOMENON: TIME, A DISEASE OF ETERNITY; HISTORY, A DISEASE OF TIME; LIFE, AGAIN, A DISEASE OF MATTER.

THEN WHAT IS NORMAL, WHAT IS HEALTHY? ETERNITY? WHICH ITSELF IS ONLY AN INFIRMITY OF GOD.

WITHOUT THE NOTION OF A FAILED UNIVERSE, THE SPECTACLE OF INJUSTICE IN EVERY SYSTEM WOULD PUT EVEN AN ABULIC INTO A STRAITJACKET.



ANNIHILATING AFFORDS A SENSE OF POWER, FLATTERS SOMETHING OBSCURE, SOMETHING ORIGINAL IN US. IT IS NOT BY ERECTING BUT BY PULVERIZING THAT WE MAY DIVINE THE SECRET SATISFACTIONS OF A GOD. WHENCE THE LURE OF DESTRUCTION AND THE ILLUSIONS IT PROVOKES AMONG THE FRENZIED OF ANY ERA.



EACH GENERATION LIVES IN THE ABSOLUTE: IT BEHAVES AS IF IT HAD REACHED THE APEX IF NOT THE END OF HISTORY.



ANY AND EVERY NATION, AT A CERTAIN MOMENT OF ITS CAREER, CONSIDERS ITSELF CHOSEN. IT IS AT THIS MOMENT THAT IT GIVES THE BEST AND THE WORST OF ITSELF.



NO ACCIDENT THAT THE TRAPPIST ORDER WAS FOUNDED IN FRANCE RATHER THAN IN ITALY OR SPAIN. GRANTED THE SPANISH AND THE ITALIANS TALK CEASELESSLY, BUT THEY DO NOT HEAR THEMSELVES TALK, WHEREAS THE FRENCHMAN RELISHES HIS ELOQUENCE, NEVER FORGETS HE IS TALKING, IS CONSUMMATELY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT HE ALONE COULD REGARD SILENCE AS AN ORDEAL, AS AN ASKESIS.



WHAT SPOILS THE FRENCH REVOLUTION FOR ME IS THAT IT ALL HAPPENS ON STAGE, THAT ITS PROMOTERS ARE BORN ACTORS, THAT THE GUILLOTINE IS MERELY A DECOR. THE HISTORY OF FRANCE, AS A WHOLE, SEEMS A BESPOKE HISTORY, AN ACTED HISTORY: EVERYTHING IN IT IS PERFECT FROM THE THEATRICAL POINT OF VIEW. IT IS A PERFORMANCE, A SERIES OF GESTURES AND EVENTS WHICH ARE WATCHED RATHER THAN SUFFERED, A SPECTACLE THAT TAKES TEN CENTURIES TO PUT ON. WHENCE THE IMPRESSION OF FRIVOLITY WHICH EVEN THE TERROR AFFORDS, SEEN FROM A DISTANCE.



PROSPEROUS SOCIETIES ARE FAR MORE FRAGILE THAN THE OTHERS, SINCE IT REMAINS FOR THEM TO ACHIEVE ONLY THEIR OWN RUIN, COMFORT NOT BEING AN IDEAL WHEN WE POSSESS IT, STILL LESS OF ONE WHEN IT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR GENERATIONS. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT NATURE HAS NOT INCLUDED WELL-BEING IN HER CALCULATIONS AND COULD NOT DO SO WITHOUT PERISHING HERSELF.



IF ALL PEOPLES TURNED APATHETIC AT ONCE, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE CONFLICTS, NO MORE WARS, NO MORE EMPIRES. BUT UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE YOUNG PEOPLES, AND INDEED YOUNG PEOPLE—A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO THE PHILANTHROPISTS’ DREAMS: TO BRING IT ABOUT THAT ALL MEN MIGHT REACH THE SAME DEGREE OF LASSITUDE OR INEFFECTUAL-ITY….



WE MUST SIDE WITH THE OPPRESSED ON EVERY OCCASION, EVEN WHEN THEY ARE IN THE WRONG, THOUGH WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FACT THAT THEY ARE MOLDED OF THE SAME CLAY AS THEIR OPPRESSORS.



CHARACTERISTIC OF DYING REGIMES: TO PERMIT A CONFUSED MIXTURE OF BELIEFS AND DOCTRINES, AND TO GIVE THE ILLUSION, AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THE MOMENT OF CHOICE CAN BE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED …

THIS IS THE SOURCE—THE SOLE SOURCE—OF THE CHARM OF PRE-REVOLUTIONARY PERIODS.



ONLY FALSE VALUES PREVAIL, BECAUSE EVERYONE CAN ASSIMILATE THEM, COUNTERFEIT THEM (FALSE THEREBY TO THE SECOND DEGREE). AN IDEA THAT SUCCEEDS IS NECESSARILY A PSEUDO-IDEA.



REVOLUTIONS ARE THE SUBLIME OF BAD LITERATURE.



THE UNFORTUNATE THING ABOUT PUBLIC MISFORTUNES IS THAT EVERYONE REGARDS HIMSELF AS QUALIFIED TO TALK ABOUT THEM.



THE RIGHT TO SUPPRESS EVERYONE THAT BOTHERS US SHOULD RANK FIRST IN THE CONSTITUTION OF THE IDEAL STATE.



THE ONLY THING THE YOUNG SHOULD BE TAUGHT IS THAT THERE IS VIRTUALLY NOTHING TO BE HOPED FOR FROM LIFE. ONE DREAMS OF A CATALOGUE OF DISAPPOINTMENTS WHICH WOULD INCLUDE ALL THE DISILLUSIONMENTS RESERVED FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US, TO BE POSTED IN THE SCHOOLS.



ACCORDING TO THE PRINCESS PALATINE, MME DE MAINTENON WAS IN THE HABIT OF REPEATING, DURING THE YEARS AFTER THE KING’S DEATH WHEN SHE HAD NO FURTHER ROLE TO PLAY: “FOR SOME TIME NOW, THERE HAS PREVAILED A SPIRIT OF VERTIGO WHICH IS SPREADING EVERYWHERE.’ THIS “SPIRIT OF VERTIGO” IS WHAT THE LOSERS HAVE ALWAYS NOTICED, CORRECTLY MOREOVER, AND WE MIGHT WELL RECONSIDER ALL HISTORY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THIS FORMULA.



PROGRESS IS THE INJUSTICE EACH GENERATION COMMITS WITH REGARD TO ITS PREDECESSOR.



THE SURFEITED HATE THEMSELVES—NOT SECRETLY BUT PUBLICLY, AND LONG TO BE SWEPT AWAY, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. THEY PREFER, IN ANY CASE, THAT THE SWEEPING BE ACCOMPLISHED WITH THEIR OWN COOPERATION. THIS IS THE MOST CURIOUS, THE MOST ORIGINAL ASPECT OF A REVOLUTIONARY SITUATION.



A NATION GENERATES ONLY ONE REVOLUTION. THE GERMANS HAVE NEVER REPEATED THE EXPLOIT OF THE REFORMATION, OR RATHER, THEY HAVE REPEATED BUT NOT EQUALED IT. FRANCE HAS REMAINED AN ETERNAL TRIBUTARY OF ‘89. EQUALLY TRUE OF RUSSIA AND OF ALL NATIONS, THIS TENDENCY TO PLAGIARIZE ONESELF IN REGARD TO REVOLUTIONS IS AT ONCE REASSURING AND DISTRESSING.



ROMANS OF THE DECADENCE ENJOYED ONLY WHAT THEY CALLED GREEK LEISURE (OTIUM GRAECUM), THE THING THEY HAD MOST DESPISED IN THE PERIOD OF THEIR VIGOR. THE ANALOGY WITH TODAY’S CIVILIZATIONS IS SO FLAGRANT IT WOULD BE INDECENT TO INSIST ON IT.



ALARIC CLAIMED THAT A “DEMON” DROVE HIM AGAINST ROME. EVERY EXHAUSTED CIVILIZATION AWAITS ITS BARBARIAN, AND EVERY BARBARIAN AWAITS HIS DEMON.



THE WEST: A SWEET-SMELLING ROTTENNESS, A PERFUMED CORPSE.



ALL THESE NATIONS WERE GREAT BECAUSE THEY HAD GREAT PREJUDICES. THEY NOW HAVE NONE. ARE THEY NATIONS STILL? AT MOST, DISINTEGRATED CROWDS.



THE WHITE RACE INCREASINGLY DESERVES THE NAME GIVEN BY THE AMERICAN INDIANS: PALEFACES.



IN EUROPE, HAPPINESS STOPS AT VIENNA. BEYOND, MISERY UPON MISERY, SINCE THE BEGINNING.



THE ROMANS, THE TURKS, AND THE BRITISH COULD FOUND LASTING EMPIRES BECAUSE, REFRACTORY TO ALL DOCTRINE, THEY IMPOSED NONE UPON THE SUBJECT NATIONS. THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE MANAGED TO WIELD SO LONG A HEGEMONY HAD THEY BEEN AFFLICTED WITH SOME MESSIANIC VICE UNHOPED-FOR OPPRESSORS, ADMINISTRATORS, AND PARASITES, LORDS WITHOUT CONVICTIONS, THEY HAD THE ART OF COMBINING AUTHORITY AND INDIFFERENCE, RIGOR AND ABANDON. IT IS THIS ART, THE SECRET OF THE TRUE MASTER, WHICH THE SPANIARDS OF OLD LACKED, AS IT IS LACKING IN THE CONQUERORS OF OUR OWN DAY.



SO LONG AS A NATION KEEPS THE AWARENESS OF ITS SUPERIORITY, IT IS FIERCE AND RESPECTED; ONCE IT LOSES THAT AWARENESS, A NATION BECOMES HUMANIZED, AND NO LONGER COUNTS.



WHEN I RAGE AGAINST THE AGE, I CAN CALM MYSELF MERELY BY THINKING OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN, OF THE RETROSPECTIVE JEALOUSY OF THOSE WHO COME AFTER US, IN CERTAIN RESPECTS, WE BELONG TO THE OLD HUMANITY, THE HUMANITY THAT COULD STILL REGRET PARADISE. BUT THOSE WHO COME AFTER US WILL NOT EVEN HAVE THE RECOURSE OF THAT REGRET, THEY WILL NOT EVEN HAVE AN IDEA OF IT, NOT EVEN THE WORD!



MY VISION OF THE FUTURE IS SO EXACT THAT IF I HAD CHILDREN, I SHOULD STRANGLE THEM HERE AND NOW.



WHEN WE THINK OF THE BERLIN SALONS IN THE ROMANTIC PERIOD, OF THE ROLE PLAYED IN THEM BY A HENRIETTA HERZ OR A RACHEL LEVIN, OF THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE LATTER AND CROWN PRINCE LOUIS-FERDINAND; AND WHEN WE THEN THINK THAT IF SUCH WOMEN HAD LIVED IN THIS CENTURY THEY WOULD HAVE DIED IN SOME GAS CHAMBER, WE CANNOT HELP CONSIDERING THE BELIEF IN PROGRESS AS THE FALSEST AND STUPIDEST OF SUPERSTITIONS.



HESIOD WAS THE FIRST TO ELABORATE A PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. AND ALSO LAUNCHED THE NOTION OF DECADENCE. BY DOING SO, WHAT A LIGHT HE CASTS ON HISTORICAL PROCESS! IF, AT THE VERY OUTSET, IN THE HEART OF THE POST-HOMERIC WORLD, HE DECIDED THAT HUMANITY WAS IN ITS IRON AGE, WHAT WOULD HE HAVE SAID A FEW CENTURIES LATER—WHAT WOULD HE SAY TODAY?

EXCEPT IN PERIODS CLOUDED OVER BY FRIVOLITY OR UTOPIA, MAN HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED HIMSELF ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE WORST. KNOWING WHAT HE KNEW, BY WHAT MIRACLE COULD HE HAVE UNCEASINGLY VARIED HIS DESIRES AND HIS TERRORS?



WHEN, JUST AFTER THE FIRST WORLD WAR, ELECTRICITY WAS INSTALLED IN THE VILLAGE WHERE I WAS BORN, THERE WAS A GENERAL MURMUR OF PROTEST, THEN MUTE DESOLATION. BUT WHEN ELECTRICITY WAS INSTALLED IN THE CHURCHES (THERE WERE THREE), EVERYONE WAS CONVINCED THE ANTICHRIST HAD COME AND, WITH HIM, THE END OF TIME.

THESE CARPATHIAN PEASANTS HAD SEEN CLEARLY, HAD SEEN FAR: EMERGING FROM PREHISTORY, THEY KNEW ALREADY, IN THAT DAY AND AGE, WHAT “CIVILIZED” MEN HAVE KNOWN ONLY RECENTLY.



IT IS MY PREJUDICE AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT TURNS OUT WELL THAT HAS GIVEN ME A TASTE FOR READING HISTORY.

IDEAS ARE UNSUITED TO A FINAL AGONY; THEY DIE, OF COURSE, BUT WITHOUT KNOWING HOW TO DIE, WHEREAS AN EVENT EXISTS ONLY WITH A VIEW TO ITS END. A SUFFICIENT REASON TO PREFER THE COMPANY OF HISTORIANS TO THAT OF PHILOSOPHERS.



DURING HIS FAMOUS EMBASSY TO ROME IN THE SECOND CENTURY B.C., CARNEADES TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE OCCASION TO SPEAK THE FIRST DAY IN FAVOR OF THE IDEA OF JUSTICE, AND ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AGAINST IT. FROM THAT MOMENT, PHILOSOPHY, HITHERTO NONEXISTENT IN THAT COUNTRY OF HEALTHY CONDUCT, BEGAN TO PERPETRATE ITS RAVAGES. WHAT IS PHILOSOPHY, THEN? THE WORM IN THE FRUIT….

CATO THE CENSOR, WHO HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE GREEK’S DIALECTICAL PERFORMANCES, WAS ALARMED BY THEM AND ASKED THE SENATE TO SATISFY THE ATHENIAN DELEGATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, SO HARMFUL AND EVEN DANGEROUS DID HE CONSIDER THEIR PRESENCE. ROMAN YOUTH WAS NOT TO FREQUENT MINDS SO DESTRUCTIVE.

ON THE MORAL LEVEL, CARNEADES AND HIS COMPANIONS WERE AS FORMIDABLE AS THE CARTHAGINIANS ON THE MILITARY. RISING NATIONS FEAR ABOVE ALL THE ABSENCE OF PREJUDICES AND PROHIBITIONS, THE INTELLECTUAL SHAMELESSNESS WHICH CONSTITUTES THE ALLURE OF DECLINING CIVILIZATIONS.



HERCULES WAS PUNISHED FOR HAVING SUCCEEDED IN ALL HIS UNDERTAKINGS. SIMILARLY TROY, TOO HAPPY, HAD TO PERISH.

PONDERING THIS VISION SHARED BY THE TRAGIC POETS, WE CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THE SO-CALLED FREE WORLD, UPON WHICH EVERY FORTUNE HAS BEEN LAVISHED, WILL INEVITABLY SUFFER ILION’S FATE, FOR THE JEALOUSY OF THE GODS SURVIVES THEIR DISAPPEARANCE.



“THE FRENCH DON’T WANT TO WORK ANY MORE, THEY ALL WANT TO WRITE, MY CONCIERGE TOLD ME, UNAWARE THAT SHE WAS THEN AND THERE PASSING JUDGMENT ON ALL OLD CIVILIZATIONS.



A SOCIETY IS DOOMED WHEN IT NO LONGER HAS THE FORCE TO BE LIMITED. HOW, WITH AN OPEN MIND—TOO OPEN—CAN IT PROTECT ITSELF AGAINST THE EXCESSES, THE MORTAL RISKS OF FREEDOM?



IDEOLOGICAL DISPUTES REACH THE POINT OF PAROXYSM ONLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE MEN HAVE FOUGHT EACH OTHER OVER WORDS, WHERE THEY HAVE GONE TO DEATH FOR WORDS …, IN THE COUNTRIES, IN SHORT, WHICH HAVE KNOWN WARS OF RELIGION.



A NATION WHICH HAS EXHAUSTED ITS MISSION IS LIKE AN AUTHOR WHO REPEATS HIMSELF—NO, WHO HAS NOTHING LEFT TO SAY. FOR TO REPEAT YOURSELF IS TO PROVE THAT YOU STILL BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, AND IN WHAT YOU HAVE SAID. BUT A DECLINING NATION NO LONGER HAS EVEN THE STRENGTH TO MOUTH ITS OLD MOTTOES, WHICH ONCE HAD ASSURED IT ITS PREEMINENCE AND ITS PRIDE.



FRENCH HAS BECOME A PROVINCIAL LANGUAGE. THE NATIVES DON’T MIND. ONLY THE FOREIGNER IS INCONSOLABLE ON ITS ACCOUNT—HE ALONE GOES INTO MOURNING FOR NUANCE….



THEMISTOCLES, BY A UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED DECREE, HAD THE INTERPRETER OF XERXES’ AMBASSADORS PUT TO DEATH “FOR HAVING DARED USE THE GREEK LANGUAGE TO EXPRESS THE ORDERS OF A BARBARIAN.”

A PEOPLE COMMITS SUCH AN ACT ONLY AT THE PEAK OF ITS CAREER. IT IS DECADENT, IT IS DYING, WHEN IT NO LONGER BELIEVES IN ITS LANGUAGE, WHEN IT STOPS BELIEVING THAT ITS LANGUAGE IS THE SUPREME FORM OF EXPRESSION, THE LANGUAGE.



A NINETEENTH-CENTURY PHILOSOPHER MAINTAINED, IN HIS INNOCENCE, THAT LA ROCHEFOUCAULD WAS RIGHT FOR THE PAST, BUT THAT HE WOULD BE INVALIDATED BY THE FIXTURE. THE IDEA OF PROGRESS DISHONORS THE INTELLECT.



THE FURTHER MAN PROCEEDS, THE LESS HE IS IN A POSITION TO SOLVE HIS PROBLEMS, AND WHEN, AT THE APEX OF HIS BLINDNESS, HE WILL BE CONVINCED HE IS ON THE POINT OF SUCCESS, THEN THE UNHEARD-OF WILL OCCUR.



I WOULD BESTIR MYSELF, AT BEST, FOR THE APOCALYPSE, BUT FOR A REVOLUTION … TO COLLABORATE WITH AN ENDING OR A GENESIS, AN ULTIMATE OR INITIAL CALAMITY, YES, BUT NOT WITH A CHANGE FOR SOME BETTER OR WORSE….



WE HAVE CONVICTIONS ONLY IF WE HAVE STUDIED NOTHING THOROUGHLY.



IN THE LONG RUN, TOLERANCE BREEDS MORE ILLS THAN INTOLERANCE. IF THIS IS TRUE, IT CONSTITUTES THE MOST SERIOUS ACCUSATION THAT CAN BE MADE AGAINST MAN.



ONCE THE ANIMALS NO LONGER NEED TO FEAR EACH OTHER, THEY FALL INTO A DAZE AND TAKE ON THAT DUMBFOUNDED LOOK THEY HAVE IN ZOOS. INDIVIDUALS AND’ NATIONS WOULD AFFORD THE SAME SPECTACLE IF SOME DAY THEY MANAGED TO LIVE IN HARMONY, NO LONGER TREMBLING OPENLY OR IN SECRET.



WITH SUFFICIENT PERSPECTIVE, NOTHING IS GOOD OR BAD. THE HISTORIAN WHO VENTURES TO JUDGE THE PAST IS WRITING JOURNALISM IN ANOTHER CENTURY.



IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS (LET US BE PRECISE!), THE SURVIVORS OF THE OVERLY FORTUNATE NATIONS WILL BE PUT ON RESERVATIONS AND VISITED, CONTEMPLATED WITH DISGUST, COMMISERATION, OR STUPOR, AND WITH A MALICIOUS ADMIRATION AS WELL.



MONKEYS LIVING IN GROUPS REJECT, APPARENTLY, THOSE WHICH IN SOME FASHION HAVE CONSORTED WITH HUMANS. HOW ONE REGRETS THAT SWIFT NEVER KNEW SUCH A DETAIL!



ARE WE TO EXECRATE OUR AGE—OR ALL AGES?

DO WE THINK OF BUDDHA WITHDRAWING FROM THE WORLD ON ACCOUNT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES?



IF HUMANITY HAS SUCH LOVE FOR SAVIORS, THOSE FANATICS WHO SO SHAMELESSLY BELIEVE IN THEMSELVES, IT IS BECAUSE HUMANITY SUPPOSES THEY BELIEVE IN IT.



THE STRENGTH OF THIS STATESMAN IS TO BE VISIONARY AND CYNICAL. A DREAMER WITHOUT SCRUPLES.



THE WORST CRIMES ARE COMMITTED OUT OF ENTHUSIASM, A MORBID STATE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DISASTERS.



THE FUTURE APPEALS TO YOU? ALL YOURS! MYSELF I PREFER TO KEEP TO THE INCREDIBLE PRESENT AND THE INCREDIBLE PAST. I LEAVE IT TO YOU TO FACE THE INCREDIBLE ITSELF.



“YOU’RE AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT’S BEEN DONE SINCE THE LAST WAR,” SAID THE VERY UP-TO-DATE LADY.

“YOU’VE GOT THE WRONG DATE: I’M AGAINST EVERYTHING THAT’S BEEN DONE SINCE ADAM.”



HITLER IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE MOST SINISTER CHARACTER IN HISTORY. AND THE MOST PATHETIC. HE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE PRECISELY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT HE WANTED, HE DESTROYED HIS IDEAL POINT BY POINT. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT HE IS A MONSTER IN A CLASS BY HIMSELF—THAT IS, A MONSTER TWICE OVER, FOR EVEN HIS PATHOS IS MONSTROUS.



ALL GREAT EVENTS HAVE BEEN SET IN MOTION BY MADMEN, BY MEDIOCRE MADMEN. WHICH WILL BE TRUE, WE MAY BE SURE, OF THE “END OF THE WORLD” ITSELF.



THE ZOHAR TEACHES THAT THOSE WHO DO EVIL ON EARTH WERE NO BETTER IN HEAVEN, THAT THEY WERE IMPATIENT TO LEAVE IT, AND, RUSHING TO THE MOUTH OF THE ABYSS, THAT THEY “ARRIVED AHEAD OF THE TIME WHEN THEY WERE TO DESCEND INTO THIS WORLD.”

ONE READILY DISCERNS THE PROFUNDITY OF THIS VISION OF THE PRE-EXISTENCE OF SOULS, AND ITS USEFULNESS WHEN WE ARE TO EXPLAIN THE ASSURANCE AND THE TRIUMPH OF THE “WICKED,” THEIR SOLIDITY AND THEIR COMPETENCE. HAVING PREPARED THEIR ENDEAVORS SO FAR AHEAD, IT IS NOT ASTONISHING THAT THEY SHOULD POSSESS THE EARTH: THEY CONQUERED IT BEFORE THEY WERE HERE …, AN ETERNITY AGO, AND FOR ALL ETERNITY, AS A MATTER OF FACT.



WHAT DISTINGUISHES THE TRUE PROPHET FROM THE REST IS THAT HE STANDS AT THE ORIGIN OF MOVEMENTS AND DOCTRINES WHICH EXCLUDE AND OPPOSE EACH OTHER.



IN A METROPOLIS AS IN A HAMLET, WHAT WE STILL LOVE BEST IS TO WATCH THE FALL OF ONE OF OUR KIND.



THE APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION IS SO DEEPLY ANCHORED WITHIN US THAT NO ONE MANAGES TO EXTIRPATE IT. IT BELONGS TO OUR CONSTITUTION, FOR THE VERY BASIS OF OUR BEING IS DEMONIAC.

THE SAGE IS A PACIFIED, WITHDRAWN DESTROYER. THE OTHERS ARE DESTROYERS IN PRACTICE.



MISFORTUNE IS A PASSIVE, ENDURED STATE, WHILE MALEDICTION SUPPOSES AN ELECTION À REBOURS, CONSEQUENTLY A NOTION OF MISSION, OF INNER POWER, WHICH IS NOT IMPLIED IN MISFORTUNE. AN ACCURSED INDIVIDUAL OR NATION NECESSARILY OUTCLASSES AN UNFORTUNATE INDIVIDUAL OR NATION.



STRICTLY SPEAKING, HISTORY DOCS NOT REPEAT ITSELF, BUT SINCE THE ILLUSIONS MAN IS CAPABLE OF ARE LIMITED IN NUMBER, THEY ALWAYS RETURN IN ANOTHER DISGUISE, THEREBY GIVING SOME ULTRADECREPIT FILTH A LOOK OF NOVELTY AND A TRAGIC GLAZE.



I READ SOME PAGES ON JOVINIAN, SAINT BASIL, AND SEVERAL OTHERS. THE CONFLICT, DURING THE FIRST CENTURIES OF CHRISTIANITY, BETWEEN ORTHODOXY AND HERESY SEEMS NO MORE INSANE THAN THE ONE TO WHICH MODERN IDEOLOGIES HAVE ACCUSTOMED US. THE MODALITIES OF THE CONTROVERSY, THE PASSIONS AT WORK, THE FOLLIES AND THE ABSURDITIES, ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL. IN BOTH CASES, EVERYTHING TURNS ON THE UNREAL AND THE UNVERIFIABLE, WHICH FORM THE VERY BASIS OF EITHER RELIGIOUS OR POLITICAL DOGMAS. HISTORY WOULD BE TOLERABLE ONLY IF WE ESCAPED BOTH KINDS. TRUE, IT WOULD THEN CEASE ALTOGETHER, FOR THE GREAT GOOD OF EVERYONE—THOSE WHO ENDURE IT AS WELL AS THOSE WHO MAKE IT.



WHAT MAKES DESTRUCTION SUSPECT IS ITS FACILITY: ANYONE WHO COMES ALONG CAN EXCEL IN IT. BUT IF TO DESTROY IS EASY, TO DESTROY ONESELF IS LESS SO. SUPERIORITY OF THE OUTCAST OVER THE AGITATOR OR THE ANARCHIST.



HAD I LIVED IN THE EARLY PERIOD OF CHRISTIANITY, I TOO, I FEAR, WOULD HAVE YIELDED TO ITS SEDUCTION. AND I HATE THAT SYMPATHIZER, THAT HYPOTHETICAL FANATIC: I CANNOT FORGIVE MYSELF THAT CONVERSION OF TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO….



TOM BETWEEN VIOLENCE AND DISILLUSIONMENT, I SEEM TO MYSELF A TERRORIST WHO, GOING OUT IN THE STREET TO PERPETRATE SOME OUTRAGE, STOPS ON THE WAY TO CONSULT ECCLESIASTES OR EPICTETUS.



ACCORDING TO HEGEL, MAN WILL BE COMPLETELY FREE ONLY “BY SURROUNDING HIMSELF WITH A WORLD ENTIRELY CREATED BY HIMSELF.”

BUT THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT HE HAS DONE, AND MAN HAS NEVER BEEN SO ENCHAINED, SO MUCH A SLAVE AS NOW.



LIFE WOULD BECOME ENDURABLE ONLY AMONG A HUMANITY WHICH WOULD NO LONGER HAVE ANY ILLUSIONS IN RESERVE, A HUMANITY COMPLETELY DISABUSED AND DELIGHTED TO BE SO.



EVERYTHING I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FEEL AND TO THINK COINCIDES WITH AN EXERCISE IN ANTI-UTOPIA.



MAN WILL NOT LAST. AMBUSHED BY EXHAUSTION, HE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR HIS TOO-ORIGINAL CAREER. FOR IT WOULD BE INCONCEIVABLE AND CONTRA NATURAM THAT HE DRAG ON MUCH LONGER AND COME TO A GOOD END. THIS PROSPECT IS DEPRESSING, HENCE LIKELY.



“ENLIGHTENED DESPOTISM”: THE ONLY REGIME THAT CAN ATTRACT A DISABUSED MIND, ONE INCAPABLE OF BEING THE ACCOMPLICE OF REVOLUTIONS SINCE IT IS NOT EVEN THE ACCOMPLICE OF HISTORY.



NOTHING MORE PAINFUL THAN TWO CONTEMPORARY PROPHETS. ONE MUST WITHDRAW, MUST DISAPPEAR IF HE IS UNWILLING TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO RIDICULE. UNLESS BOTH ARE THUS EXPOSED, WHICH WOULD BE THE MOST EQUITABLE SOLUTION.



I AM STIRRED, EVEN OVERWHELMED EACH TIME I HAPPEN UPON AN INNOCENT PERSON. WHERE DOES HE COME FROM? WHAT IS HE AFTER? DOESN’T SUCH AN APPARITION HERALD SOME DISASTER? IT IS A VERY SPECIAL DISTURBANCE WE SUFFER IN THE PRESENCE OF SOMEONE THERE IS NO WAY OF CALLING OUR KIND.



WHEREVER CIVILIZED MEN APPEARED FOR THE FIRST TIME, THEY WERE REGARDED BY THE NATIVES AS DEVILS, AS GHOSTS, SPECTERS. NEVER AS LIVING MEN! UNEQUALED INTUITION, A PROPHETIC INSIGHT, IF EVER THERE WAS ONE.



IF EVERYONE HAD SEEN THROUGH EVERYTHING, IF EVERYONE HAD “UNDERSTOOD,” HISTORY WOULD HAVE CEASED LONG SINCE. BUT WE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY, BIOLOGICALLY UNSUITED TO “UNDERSTAND.” AND EVEN IF EVERYONE UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT FOR ONE, HISTORY WOULD BE PERPETUATED BECAUSE OF THAT ONE, BECAUSE OF HIS BLINDNESS. BECAUSE OF A SINGLE ILLUSION!



X MAINTAINS WE ARE AT THE END OF A “COSMIC CYCLE” AND THAT SOON EVERYTHING WILL FALL APART. AND HE DOES NOT DOUBT THIS FOR ONE MOMENT.

AT THE SAME TIME, HE IS THE FATHER OF A—NUMEROUS—FAMILY. WITH CERTITUDES LIKE HIS, WHAT ABERRATION HAS DELUDED HIM INTO BRINGING INTO A DOOMED WORLD ONE CHILD AFTER THE NEXT? IF WE FORESEE THE END, IF WE ARE SURE IT WILL BE COMING SOON, IF WE EVEN ANTICIPATE IT, BETTER TO DO SO ALONE. ONE DOES NOT PROCREATE ON PATMOS.



MONTAIGNE, A SAGE, HAS HAD NO POSTERITY. ROUSSEAU, AN HYSTERIC, STILL STIRS NATIONS. I LIKE ONLY THE THINKERS WHO HAVE INSPIRED NO TRIBUNE OF THE PEOPLE.



IN 1441, THE COUNCIL OF FLORENCE DECREED THAT PAGANS, JEWS, HERETICS, AND SCHISMATICS WILL HAVE NO PART IN “ETERNAL LIFE” AND THAT ALL, UNLESS THEY EMBRACE, BEFORE DYING, THE TRUE RELIGION, WILL GO STRAIGHT TO HELL.

IN THE DAYS WHEN THE CHURCH PROFESSED SUCH ENORMITIES IT WAS TRULY THE CHURCH. AN INSTITUTION IS VITAL AND STRONG ONLY IF IT REJECTS EVERYTHING WHICH IS NOT ITSELF. UNFORTUNATELY THE SAME IS TRUE OF A NATION OR OF A REGIME.



A SERIOUS, HONEST MIND UNDERSTANDS—AND CAN UNDERSTAND—NOTHING OF HISTORY. HISTORY IN RETURN IS MARVELOUSLY SUITED TO DELIGHT AN ERUDITE CYNIC.



EXTRAORDINARY PLEASURE AT THE THOUGHT THAT, BEING HUMAN, ONE IS BORN UNDER AN ACCURSED STAR, AND THAT WHATEVER ONE HAS UNDERTAKEN AND WHATEVER ONE IS GOING TO UNDERTAKE WILL BE FONDLED BY MISCHANCE.



PLOTINUS BEFRIENDED A ROMAN SENATOR WHO HAD FREED HIS SLAVES, RENOUNCED HIS WEALTH, AND WHO ATE AND SLEPT AT THE HOUSES OF FRIENDS, FOR HE NO LONGER OWNED ANYTHING. THIS SENATOR, FROM THE “OFFICIAL” POINT OF VIEW, WAS DERANGED, AND HIS CASE WOULD BE REGARDED AS DISTRESSING, WHICH INDEED IT WAS: A SAINT IN THE SENATE…. HIS PRESENCE, EVEN HIS POSSIBILITY—WHAT AN OMEN! THE HORDES WERE NOT FAR….



A MAN WHO HAS COMPLETELY VANQUISHED SELFISHNESS, WHO RETAINS NO TRACE OF IT WHATEVER, CANNOT LIVE LONGER THAN TWENTY-ONE DAYS, ACCORDING TO ONE MODERN VEDANTIST SCHOOL. NO WESTERN MORALIST, NOT EVEN THE GRIMMEST, WOULD HAVE DARED VENTURE AN OBSERVATION ON HUMAN NATURE SO STARTLING, SO REVEALING.



WE INVOKE “PROGRESS” LESS AND LESS AND “MUTATION” MORE AND MORE, AND ALL THAT WE ALLEGE TO ILLUSTRATE THE LATTER’S ADVANTAGES IS MERELY ONE SYMPTOM AFTER ANOTHER OF AN UNRIVALED CATASTROPHE.



WE CAN BREATHE—AND BRAWL—ONLY IN A CORRUPT REGIME. BUT WE REALIZE AS MUCH ONLY AFTER HAVING CONTRIBUTED TO ITS DESTRUCTION, AND WHEN NOTHING IS LEFT BUT OUR CAPACITY TO REGRET IT.



WHAT WE CALL THE CREATIVE INSTINCT IS MERELY A DEVIATION, MERELY A PERVERSION OF OUR NATURE: WE HAVE NOT BEEN BROUGHT INTO THE WORLD IN ORDER TO INNOVATE, TO REVOLUTIONIZE, BUT TO ENJOY OUR SEMBLANCE OF BEING, IN ORDER TO LIQUIDATE IT QUIETLY AND TO VANISH AFTERWARD WITHOUT A FUSS.



THE AZTECS WERE RIGHT TO BELIEVE THE GODS MUST BE APPEASED, TO OFFER THEM HUMAN BLOOD EVERY DAY IN ORDER TO KEEP THE UNIVERSE FROM SINKING BACK INTO CHAOS.

WE LONG SINCE CEASED TO BELIEVE IN THE GODS, AND WE NO LONGER OFFER THEM SACRIFICES. YET THE WORLD IS STILL HERE. NO DOUBT. ONLY WE NO LONGER HAVE THE GOOD LUCK TO KNOW WHY IT DOES NOT COLLAPSE ON THE SPOT.

WE PURSUE WHATEVER WE PURSUE OUT OF TORMENT—A NEED FOR TORMENT. OUR VERY QUEST FOR SALVATION IS A TORMENT, THE SUBTLEST, THE BEST CAMOULAGED OF ALL



IF IT IS TRUE THAT BY DEATH WE ONCE MORE BECOME WHAT WE WERE BEFORE BEING, WOULD IT NOT HAVE BEEN TETTER TO ABIDE BY THAT PURE POSSIBILITY, NOT TO STIR FROM IT? WHAT USE WAS THIS DETOUR, WHEN WE MIGHT HAVE REMAINED FOREVER IN AN UNREALIZED PLENITUDE?



ONCE MY BODY GIVES ME THE SLIP, HOW, I WONDER, WITH SUCH CARRION ON MY HANDS, WILL I COMBAT THE CAPITULATION OF MY ORGANS?



THE ANCIENT GODS RIDICULED MEN, ENVIED THEM, HUNTED THEM DOWN ON OCCASION, HARRIED THEM. THE GOD OF THE GOSPELS WAS LESS MOCKING AND LESS JEALOUS, AND MORTAL MEN DID NOT EVEN ENJOY, IN THEIR MISERIES, THE CONSOLATION OF BEING ABLE TO ACCUSE HIM. WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE ABSENCE OR THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF A CHRISTIAN AESCHYLUS. A GOOD GOD HAS KILLED TRAGEDY. ZEUS DESERVED DIFFERENTLY OF LITERATURE.



HAUNTED, OBSESSED BY ABDICATION, AS FAR BACK AS I CAN REMEMBER. BUT ABDICATION OF WHAT? IF I ONCE LONGED TO BE “SOMEONE,” IT WAS ONLY FOR THE SATISFACTION OF SOMEDAY BEING ABLE TO SAY, LIKE CHARLES V AT YUSTE: “I AM NO LONGER ANYTHING.”



SOME OF THE PROVINCIAL LETTERS WERE REWRITTEN AS MANY AS SEVENTEEN TIMES. ASTOUNDING THAT PASCAL COULD HAVE EXPENDED SO MUCH TIME AND ENERGY WHOSE INTEREST SEEMS MINIMAL TO US NOW. EVERY POLEMIC DATES—EVERY POLEMIC WITH MEN. IN THE PENSÉES, THE DEBATE WAS WITH GOD. THIS STILL CONCERNS US SOMEWHAT.



SAINT SERAPHIM OF SAROV, IN HIS FIFTEEN YEARS OF COMPLETE SECLUSION, OPENED HIS CELL DOOR TO NO ONE, NOT EVEN TO THE BISHOP WHO OCCASIONALLY VISITED THE HERMITAGE. “SILENCE,” HE WOULD SAY, “BRINGS MAN CLOSER TO GOD AND MAKES HIM, ON EARTH, LIKE UNTO THE ANGELS.”

WHAT THE SAINT SHOULD HAVE ADDED IS THAT SILENCE IS NEVER DEEPER THAN IN THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PRAYER….



MODERN MAN HAS LOST THE SENSE OF FATE AND THEREBY THE SAVOR OF LAMENTATION. IN THE THEATER WE SHOULD REINSTATE THE CHORUS AT ONCE, AND AT FUNERALS, THE MOURNERS….



IN ANXIETY, A MAN CLINGS TO WHATEVER CAN REINFORCE, CAN STIMULATE HIS PROVIDENTIAL DISCOMFORT: TO TRY TO CURE HIM OF IT IS TO DESTROY HIS EQUILIBRIUM, ANXIETY BEING THE BASIS OF HIS EXISTENCE AND HIS PROSPERITY. THE CUNNING CONFESSOR KNOWS IT IS NECESSARY, KNOWS THAT WE CANNOT DO WITHOUT ANXIETY ONCE WE HAVE KNOWN IT. SINCE HE DARES NOT PROCLAIM ITS BENEFITS, HE EMPLOYS A DETOUR—HE VAUNTS REMORSE, AN ADMITTED, AN HONORABLE ANXIETY. HIS CUSTOMERS ARE GRATEFUL; HENCE HE MANAGES TO KEEP THEM READILY ENOUGH, WHEREAS HIS LAY COLLEAGUES STRUGGLE AND GROVEL TO KEEP THEIRS.



YOU ONCE TOLD ME DEATH DID NOT EXIST. AGREED, PROVIDED YOU ADD THAT NOTHING EXISTS. TO GRANT REALITY TO ANYTHING AND TO DENY IT TO WHAT SEEMS SO MANIFESTLY REAL IS SHEER EXTRAVAGANCE.



WHEN WE HAVE COMMITTED THE FOLLY OF CONFIDING A SECRET TO SOMEONE, THE ONLY WAY OF BEING SURE HE WILL KEEP IT TO HIMSELF IS TO KILL HIM ON THE SPOT.



“SICKNESSES, SOME BY DAY, OTHERS BY NIGHT, IN THEIR FASHION, VISIT MEN, BEARING SUFFERING TO MORTALS—IN SILENCE, FOR WISE ZEUS HAS DENIED THEM SPEECH” (HESIOD).

FORTUNATELY, FOR, BEING MUTE, THEY ARE ALREADY EXCRUCIATING—WHAT WOULD THEY BE IF THEY WERE GARRULOUS AS WELL? CAN WE IMAGINE EVEN ONE PROCLAIMING ITSELF? INSTEAD OF SYMPTOMS, DECLARATIONS! ZEUS, FOR ONCE, HAS SHOWN SIGNS OF DELICACY.



IN PERIODS OF STERILITY, ONE SHOULD HIBERNATE, SLEEP DAY AND NIGHT TO PRESERVE ONE’S STRENGTH, INSTEAD OF WASTING IT IN MORTIFICATION AND RAGE.



WE CAN ADMIRE SOMEONE ONLY IF HE IS THREE-QUARTERS IRRESPONSIBLE—ADMIRATION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RESPECT.



THE NOT AT ALL NEGLIGIBLE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING GREATLY HATED MEN IS THAT ONE COMES TO ENDURE THEM BY THE EXHAUSTION OF THIS VERY HATRED.



ONCE THE SHUTTERS ARE CLOSED, I STRETCH OUT IN THE DARK. THE OUTER WORLD, A FADING MURMUR, DISSOLVES. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS MYSELF AND … THERE’S THE RUB. HERMITS HAVE SPENT THEIR LIVES IN DIALOGUE WITH WHAT WAS MOST HIDDEN WITHIN THEM. IF ONLY, FOLLOWING THEIR EXAMPLE, I COULD GIVE MYSELF UP TO THAT EXTREME EXERCISE, IN WHICH ONE UNITES WITH THE INTIMACY OF ONE’S OWN BEING! IT IS THIS SELF-INTERVIEW, THIS INWARD TRANSITION WHICH MATTERS, AND WHICH HAS NO VALUE UNLESS CONTINUALLY RENEWED, SO THAT THE SELF IS FINALLY ABSORBED BY ITS ESSENTIAL VERSION.



EVEN IN GOD’S COMPANY, DISCONTENT WAS BREWING, AS THE REVOLT OF THE ANGELS TESTIFIES—THE FIRST ON RECORD. APPARENTLY ON EVERY LEVEL OF CREATION, NO ONE IS FORGIVEN HIS SUPERIORITY. WE MIGHT EVEN CONCEIVE OF AN ENVIOUS FLOWER.



THE VIRTUES HAVE NO FACE. IMPERSONAL, ABSTRACT, CONVENTIONAL, THEY WEAR OUT FASTER THAN THE VICES, WHICH, MORE POWERFULLY CHARGED WITH VITALITY, DEFINE THEMSELVES AND BECOME ACCENTUATED WITH AGE.



“EVERYTHING IS FILLED WITH GODS,” SAID THAÏES, AT THE DAWN OF PHILOSOPHY; AT THE OTHER END, AT THIS TWILIGHT WE HAVE COME TO, WE CAN PROCLAIM, NOT ONLY OUT OF A NEED FOR SYMMETRY BUT EVEN MORE OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE EVIDENCE, THAT “EVERYTHING IS EMPTIED OF GODS,” ‘



I WAS ALONE IN THAT CEMETERY OVERLOOKING THE VILLAGE WHEN A PREGNANT WOMAN CAME IN. I LEFT AT ONCE, IN ORDER NOT TO LOOK AT THIS CORPSE-BEARER AT CLOSE RANGE, NOR TO RUMINATE UPON THE CONTRAST BETWEEN AN AGGRESSIVE WOMB AND THE TIME-WORN TOMBS—BETWEEN A FALSE PROMISE AND THE END OF ALL PROMISES.



THE DESIRE TO PRAY HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FAITH. IT EMANATES FROM A SPECIAL DESPONDENCY, AND LASTS AS LONG, EVEN WHILE THE GODS AND THEIR VERY MEMORY MAY VANISH AWAY FOREVER.



“NO LANGUAGE CAN HOPE FOR ANYTHING BUT ITS OWN DEFEAT” (GREGORY PALAMAS).

SO RADICAL A CONDEMNATION OF ALL LITERATURE COULD COME ONLY FROM A MYSTIC—FROM A PROFESSIONAL OF THE INEXPRESSIBLE.



IN ANTIQUITY, ONE RESORTED READILY, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE PHILOSOPHERS, TO VOLUNTARY ASPHYXIA—ONE HELD ONE’S BREATH UNTIL … ONE DIED. SO ELEGANT AND YET SO PRACTICAL A MODE OF BEING DONE WITH IT HAS COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED, AND IT IS ANYTHING BUT CERTAIN IT CAN EVER REAPPEAR.



IT HAS BEEN SAID AND SAID AGAIN: THE CONCEPT OF DESTINY, WHICH SUPPOSES CHANGE, HISTORY, DOES NOT APPLY TO AN IMMUTABLE BEING. HENCE WE CANNOT SPEAK OF GOD’S “DESTINY.”

DOUBTLESS WE CANNOT, IN THEORY. IN PRACTICE, WE DO NOTHING BUT, PARTICULARLY IN THE PERIODS WHEN BELIEFS ARE DISSOLVING, WHEN FAITH IS SHAKY, WHEN NOTHING SEEMS ABLE TO WITHSTAND TIME, WHEN GOD HIMSELF IS SWEPT INTO THE GENERAL DELIQUESCENCE.



ONCE WE BEGIN TO WANT, WE FALL UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE DEVIL.



LIFE IS NOTHING; DEATH, EVERYTHING. YET THERE IS NOTHING WHICH IS DEATH, INDEPENDENT OF LIFE. IT IS PRECISELY THIS ABSENCE OF AUTONOMOUS, DISTINCT REALITY WHICH MAKES DEATH UNIVERSAL; IT HAS NO REALM OF ITS OWN, IT IS OMNIPRESENT, LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH LACKS IDENTITY, LIMIT, AND BEARING: AN INDECENT INFINITUDE.



EUPHORIA. INCAPABLE OF ARTICULATING MY HABITUAL MOODS AND THE REFLECTIONS THEY ENGENDER, IMPELLED BY SOME UNKNOWN POWER, I EXULTED WITHOUT MOTIVE, AND IT IS JUST SUCH JUBILATION, OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN, I REMINDED MYSELF, WHICH IS THE EXPERIENCE OF THOSE WHO DO AND STRIVE, THOSE WHO PRODUCE. THEY NEITHER CAN NOR WILL REFLECT ON WHAT DENIES THEM. AND IF THEY DID, IT WOULD BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE, AS WAS THE CASE FOR ME THAT MEMORABLE DAY.



WHY EMBROIDER UPON WHAT EXCLUDES COMMENTARY? A TEXT EXPLAINED IS NO LONGER A TEXT. WE LIVE WITH AN IDEA, WE DON’T DISSECT IT; WE STRUGGLE WITH IT, WE DON’T DESCRIBE THE STAGES OF THE CONFLICT. THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY IS THE NEGATION OF PHILOSOPHY.



A SUSPECT SCRAPIE LED ME TO WONDER EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS BY WHICH I WAS FATIGUED, AND I BEGAN DRAWING UP THE LIST: THOUGH INCOMPLETE, IT APPEARED SO LONG, AND SO DEPRESSING, THAT I DECIDED TO FALL BACK ON FATIGUE IN ITSELF A FLATTERING FORMULA WHICH, THANKS TO ITS PHILOSOPHICAL INGREDIENT, MIGHT RESTORE A PLAGUE VICTIM.



DESTRUCTION AND EXPLOSION OF SYNTAX, VICTORY OF AMBIGUITY AND APPROXIMATION. ALL VERY WELL. BUT JUST TRY TO DRAW UP A WILL, AND YOU’LL SEE IF THE DEFUNCT RIGOR WAS SO CONTEMPTIBLE.



AN APHORISM? FIRE WITHOUT FLAMES. UNDERSTANDABLE THAT NO ONE TRIES TO WARM HIMSELF AT IT.



EVEN IF I WERE TO LOSE MY REASON, I COULD NEVER BRING MYSELF TO THAT “UNINTERRUPTED PRAYER” ADVOCATED BY THE HESYCHASTS. ALL I UNDERSTAND ABOUT PIETY IS ITS EXCESSES, ITS SUSPECT OUTRAGES, AND ASKESIS WOULD NOT INTEREST ME A MOMENT IF ONE DID NOT ENCOUNTER THERE ALL THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE THE LOT OF THE BAD MONK: INDOLENCE, GLUTTONY, THE THIRST FOR DESOLATION, GREED, AND AVERSION FOR THE WORLD, VACILLATION BETWEEN TRAGEDY AND THE EQUIVOCAL, HOPE OF AN INNER COLLAPSE….



I FORGET WHICH FATHER RECOMMENDS MANUAL LABOR AGAINST ACEDIA. ADMIRABLE ADVICE, WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS FOLLOWED SPONTANEOUSLY: NO DEPRESSION, THAT SECULAR ACEDIA, CAN RESIST PUTTERING.



YEARS NOW WITHOUT COFFEE, WITHOUT ALCOHOL, WITHOUT TOBACCO, … LUCKILY, THERE IS ANXIETY, WHICH USEFULLY REPLACES THE STRONGEST STIMULANTS.



THE WORST REPROACH TO BE MADE AGAINST POLICE STATES IS THAT THEY OBLIGE—FOR PRUDENCE’S SAKE—THE DESTRUCTION OF LETTERS AND DIARIES, I.E., WHAT IS LEAST FALSE IN LITERATURE.



TO KEEP THE MIND ALERT, SLANDER TURNS OUT TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS DISEASE: THE SAME VIGILANCE, THE SAME FIXED ATTENTION, THE SAME INSECURITY, THE SAME FLAGELLATING HYSTERIA, THE SAME MORTAL ENRICHMENT



I AM NOTHING, OBVIOUSLY, BUT SINCE FOR SO LONG I WANTED TO BE SOMETHING, I FAIL TO SMOTHER THAT ASPIRATION, THAT WILL: IT EXISTS BECAUSE IT HAS EXISTED, IT BELABORS ME AND PREVAILS, THOUGH I REJECT IT. TRY AS I DO TO RELEGATE IT TO MY PAST, IT KICKS UP AGAIN AND TORMENTS ME: NEVER HAVING BEEN SATISFIED, IT HAS MAINTAINED ITSELF INTACT, AND HAS NO INTENTION OF YIELDING TO MY ORDERS. CAUGHT BETWEEN MY WILL AND MYSELF, WHAT CAN I DO?



IN BIS LADDER OF PARADISE, SAINT JOHN CLIMACUS NOTES THAT A PROUD MONK HAS NO NEED TO BE PERSECUTED BY THE DEVIL—HE IS HIMSELF HIS OWN DEVIL.

I THINK OF X, WHOSE LIFE IN THE MONASTERY WAS A FAILURE. NO ONE WAS TETTER CONSTITUTED TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF IN THE WORLD AND TO SHINE THERE. UNSUITED TO HUMILITY, TO OBEDIENCE, HE CHOSE SOLITUDE AND BOGGED DOWN IN IT. THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIM TO BECOME, ACCORDING TO THE SAME SAINT’S EXPRESSION, “THE LOVER OF GOD.” OUT OF IRONY ONE CAN NEITHER CREATE ONE’S OWN SALVATION NOR HELP OTHERS CREATE THEIRS; ONE CAN MERELY DISGUISE ONE’S WOUNDS, IF NOT ONE’S DISTASTES.



IT IS A GREAT FORCE, AND A GREAT FORTUNE, TO BE ABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT ANY AMBITION WHATEVER. I ASPIRE TO IT, BUT THE VERY FACT OF SO ASPIRING STILL PARTICIPATES IN AMBITION.



THE BLANK TIME OF MEDITATION IS, IN TRUTH, THE ONLY “FOIL” TIME. WE SHOULD NEVER BLUSH TO ACCUMULATE VACANT MOMENTS—VACANT IN APPEARANCE, FILLED IN FACT. TO MEDITATE IS A SUPREME LEISURE, WHOSE SECRET HAS BEEN LOST.



NOBLE GESTURES ARE ALWAYS SUSPECT. EACH TIME, WE REGRET HAVING COMMITTED THEM. SOMETHING FALSE ABOUT THEM, SOMETHING THEATRICAL, ATTITUDINIZING. IT IS TRUE THAT WE REGRET IGNOBLE GESTURES ALMOST AS MUCH.



IF I REFLECT ON ANY MOMENT OF MY LIFE, THE MOST FEVERISH OR THE MOST NEUTRAL, WHAT REMAINS?—AND WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THERE NOW BETWEEN THEM? EVERYTHING HAVING BECOME THE SAME, WITHOUT RELIEF AND WITHOUT REALITY, IT IS WHEN I FELT NOTHING THAT I WAS CLOSEST TO THE TRUTH, I MEAN TO MY PRESENT STATE IN WHICH I AM RECAPITULATING MY EXPERIENCES. WHAT IS THE USE OF HAVING FELT ANYTHING AT ALL? THERE IS NO “ECSTASY” WHICH EITHER MEMORY OR IMAGINATION CAN RESUSCITATE!



NO ONE, BEFORE HIS LAST MOMENT, MANAGES TO USE UP HIS DEATH ALTOGETHER: EVEN FOR THE BORN MORIBUND, DEATH HAS A TOUCH OF NOVELTY.



ACCORDING TO THE CABBALA, GOD CREATED SOULS AT THE BEGINNING, AND THEY WERE ALL BEFORE HIM IN THE FORM THEY WOULD LATER TAKE IN THEIR INCARNATION. EACH SOUL, WHEN ITS TIME HAS COME, RECEIVES THE ORDER TO JOIN THE BODY DESTINED FOR IT, BUT EACH TO NO AVAIL IMPLORES ITS CREATOR TO SPARE IT THIS BONDAGE AND THIS CORRUPTION.

THE MORE I THINK OF WHAT COULD NOT HAVE FAILED TO HAPPEN WHEN MY OWN SOUL’S TURN CAME, THE MORE I REALIZE THAT IF THERE WAS ONE SOUL WHICH MORE THAN THE REST MUST HAVE RESISTED INCARNATION, IT WAS MINE.



WE DISMISS THE SKEPTIC, WE SPEAK OF AN “AUTOMATISM OF DOUBT,” WHILE WE NEVER SAY OF A BELIEVER THAT HE HAS FALLEN INTO AN “AUTOMATISM OF FAITH.” YET FAITH IS MUCH MORE MECHANICAL THAN DOUBT, WHICH HAS THE EXCUSE OF PROCEEDING FROM SURPRISE TO SURPRISE—INSIDE PERPLEXITY, IT IS TRUE.



THAT FAINT LIGHT IN EACH OF US WHICH DATES BACK TO BEFORE OUR BIRTH, TO BEFORE ALL BIRTHS, IS WHAT MUST BE PROTECTED IF WE WANT TO REJOIN THAT REMOTE GLORY FROM WHICH WE SHALL NEVER KNOW WHY WE WERE SEPARATED.



I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A SINGLE SENSATION OF FULFILLMENT, OF TRUE HAPPINESS, WITHOUT THINKING THAT IT WAS THE MOMENT WHEN—NOW OR NEVER—I SHOULD DISAPPEAR FOR GOOD.



A MOMENT COMES WHEN IT SEEMS FUTILE TO HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN METAPHYSICS AND AMATEURISM, BETWEEN THE UNFATHOMABLE AND THE ANECDOTE.



TO MEASURE ACCURATELY THE DECLINE CHRISTIANITY REPRESENTS IN RELATION TO PAGANISM, WE NEED MERELY COMPARE THE PATHETIC REMARKS OF THE CHURCH FATHERS ON SUICIDE WITH THE OPINIONS OFFERED ON THE SAME SUBJECT BY A PLINY, A SENECA, AND EVEN A CICERO.



WHAT IS THE POINT OF WHAT WE SAY? IS THERE ANY MEANING TO THIS SERIES OF PROPOSITIONS WHICH CONSTITUTES OUR TALK? AND DO THESE PROPOSITIONS, TAKEN ONE BY ONE, HAVE ANY OBJECT? WE CAN TALK ONLY IF WE SET ASIDE THIS QUESTION, OR IF WE RAISE IT AS INFREQUENTLY AS POSSIBLE.



“TO HELL WITH EVERYTHING’—IF THESE WORDS HAVE BEEN UTTERED, EVEN ONLY ONCE, COLDLY, WITH COMPLETE AWARENESS OF WHAT THEY MEAN, HISTORY IS JUSTIFIED AND, WITH IT, ALL OF US.



“WOE UNTO YOU, WHEN ALL MEN SPEAK WELL OF YOU!” CHRIST WAS HERE FORETELLING HIS OWN END. ALL MEN NOW SPEAK WELL OF HIM, EVEN THE MOST HARDENED UNBELIEVERS—THEY ABOVE ALL. JESUS KNEW PERFECTLY WELL THAT HE WOULD ONE DAY SUCCUMB TO UNIVERSAL APPROBATION.

CHRISTIANITY IS LOST IF IT DOES NOT SUFFER PERSECUTIONS AS PITILESS AS THOSE IT WAS SUBJECTED TO AT ITS BEGINNING. IT MUST PROVOKE ENEMIES AT ALL COSTS, PREPARE GREAT CALAMITIES FOR ITSELF. ONLY A NEW NERO MIGHT STILL BE ABLE TO SAVE IT.



I BELIEVE SPEECH TO BE A RECENT INVENTION, AND FIND IT HARD TO IMAGINE A DIALOGUE THAT DATES BACK BEYOND TEN THOUSAND YEARS. AND EVEN HARDER, A DIALOGUE THAT WILL OCCUR IN NOT TEN THOUSAND BUT EVEN A THOUSAND YEARS FROM NOW.



IN A WORK OF PSYCHIATRY, ONLY THE PATIENTS’ REMARKS INTEREST ME; IN A WORK OF CRITICISM, ONLY THE QUOTATIONS.



NO ONE CAN DO ANYTHING FOR THIS POLISH WOMAN, WHO IS BEYOND SICKNESS AND HEALTH, EVEN BEYOND LIVING AND DYING. A PHANTOM CANNOT BE CURED, STILL LESS AN ENLIGHTENED MIND. WE CAN CURE ONLY THOSE WHO BELONG TO THE EARTH AND STILL HAVE THEIR ROOTS IN IT, HOWEVER SUPERFICIAL.



THE PERIODS OF STERILITY WE PASS THROUGH COINCIDE WITH AN EXACERBATION OF OUR DISCERNMENT—WITH THE ECLIPSE OF THE MADMAN IN US.



TO PROCEED TO THE EXTREMITIES OF ONE’S ART AND, EVEN FURTHER, OF ONE’S BEING: SUCH IS THE LAW OF ANY MAN WHO REGARDS HIMSELF TO ANY DEGREE AS CHOSEN.



IT IS BECAUSE OF SPEECH THAT MEN GIVE THE ILLUSION OF BEING FREE. IF THEY DID—WITHOUT A WORD—WHAT THEY DO, WE WOULD TAKE THEM FOR ROBOTS. BY SPEAKING, THEY DECEIVE THEMSELVES, AS THEY DECEIVE OTHERS: BECAUSE THEY SAY WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO, WHO COULD SUSPECT THEY ARE NOT MASTERS OF THEIR ACTIONS?



DEEP INSIDE, EACH MAN FEELS—AND BELIEVES—HIMSELF TO BE IMMORTAL, EVEN IF HE KNOWS HE WILL PERISH THE NEXT MOMENT. WE CAN UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING, ADMIT EVERYTHING, REALIZE EVERYTHING, EXCEPT OUR DEATH, EVEN WHEN WE PONDER IT UNREMITTINGLY AND EVEN WHEN WE ARE RESIGNED TO IT.



IN THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE THAT MORNING, I WATCHED THE CATTLE BEING LED TO THEIR DEATH. ALMOST EVERY ANIMAL, AT THE LAST MOMENT, REFUSED TO MOVE FORWARD. TO MAKE THEM DO SO, A MAN HIT THEM ON THE HIND LEGS.

THIS SCENE OFTEN COMES TO MIND WHEN, EJECTED FROM SLEEP, I LACK THE STRENGTH TO CONFRONT THE DAILY TORTURE OF TIME.



I PRIDE MYSELF ON MY CAPACITY TO PERCEIVE THE TRANSITORY CHARACTER OF EVERYTHING. AN ODD GIFT WHICH HAS SPOILED ALL MY JOYS; BETTER: ALL MY SENSATIONS.



EVERYONE EXPIATES HIS FIRST MOMENT.



FOR AN INSTANT, I THINK I EXPERIENCED WHAT ABSORPTION INTO BRAHMA MIGHT SIGNIFY FOR AN ADEPT OF THE VEDANTA. HOW MUCH I LONGED FOR THAT INSTANT TO BE EXTENSIBLE—INFINITELY !



I SOUGHT IN DOUBT A REMEDY FOR ANXIETY. THE REMEDY ENDED BY MAKING COMMON CAUSE WITH THE DISEASE.



“IF A DOCTRINE SPREADS, IT IS BECAUSE HEAVEN HAS SO DESIRED” (CONFUCIUS).

… AS I SHOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE EACH TIME THAT, FACED WITH SOME VICTORIOUS ABERRATION, MY RAGE BORDERS ON APOPLEXY.



THE NUMBER OF FANATICS, EXTREMISTS, AND DEGENERATES I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ADMIRE! A RELIEF BORDERING ON ORGASM AT THE NOTION THAT ONE WILL NEVER AGAIN EMBRACE A CAUSE, ANY CAUSE …



AN ACROBAT? AN ORCHESTRA CONDUCTOR CAUGHT UP BY THE IDEA? HE RUSHES IN, THEN CALMS DOWN, ALTERNATES THE ALLEGRO WITH THE ANDANTE, A MASTER OF HIMSELF LIKE THE FAKIRS OR THE SWINDLERS. WHILE HE IS TALKING, HE SEEMS TO BE SEEKING SOMETHING, BUT ONE NEVER KNOWS WHAT: AN EXPERT IN THE ART OF COUNTERFEITING THE THINKER. IF HE WERE TO SAY A SINGLE THING THAT WAS PERFECTLY CLEAR, HE WOULD BE LOST. SINCE HE IS AS IGNORANT AS HIS HEARERS OF WHAT HE WANTS TO SAY OR WHAT HE WANTS, HE CAN GO ON FOR HOURS WITHOUT EXHAUSTING THE AMAZEMENT OF THE PUPPETS LISTENING TO HIM.



A PRIVILEGE TO LIVE IN CONFLICT WITH ONE’S TIMES. AT EVERY MOMENT ONE IS AWARE ONE DOES NOT THINK LIKE THE OTHERS. THIS STATE OF ACUTE DISSIMILARITY, HOWEVER INDIGENT OR STERILE IT APPEARS, NONETHELESS POSSESSES A PHILOSOPHICAL STATUS WHICH ONE WOULD BE AT A LOSS TO SEEK IN COGITATIONS ATTUNED TO EVENTS.



“THERE’S NO HELP FOR IT,” THE NONAGENARIAN KEPT REPEATING TO WHATEVER I SAID, TO WHATEVER I SHOUTED INTO HER EAR CONCERNING THE PRESENT, THE FUTURE, THE MARCH OF EVENTS….

IN THE HOPE OF GETTING SOME OTHER RESPONSE FROM HER, I WENT ON WITH MY APPREHENSIONS, MY GRIEVANCES, MY COMPLAINTS. OBTAINING ONLY THE SEMPITERNAL “NO HELP FOR IT,” I CAME TO THE END OF MY PATIENCE AND LEFT, IRRITATED WITH MYSELF, IRRITATED WITH HER. WHAT FOLLY, TO CONFIDE IN AN IDIOT!

OUTSIDE, COMPLETE REVERSAL: “BUT THE OLD WOMAN’S RIGHT. HOW COULD I FAIL TO REALIZE RIGHT AWAY THAT HER REFRAIN HAD A TRUTH IN IT, DOUBTLESS THE MOST IMPORTANT TRUTH OF ALL, SINCE EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS PROCLAIMS IT AND EVERYTHING IN OURSELVES REJECTS IT?”

TWO KINDS OF INTUITIONS: ORIGINAL (HOMER, UPANISHADS, FOLKLORE) AND BELATED (MAHAYANA BUDDHISM, ROMAN STOICISM, ALEXANDRIAN GNOSIS). FIRST FLASHES AND FADING GLOWS. THE WAKENING OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE LASSITUDE OF BEING AWAKENED.



IF IT IS TRUE THAT WHAT PERISHES HAS NEVER EXISTED, BIRTH, SOURCE OF THE PERISHABLE, EXISTS AS LITTLE AS THE REST



BEWARE OF EUPHEMISMS! THEY AGGRAVATE THE HORROR THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO DISGUISE. TO USE, AS THE FRENCH DO, “THE DISAPPEARED” INSTEAD OF THE DECEASED OR THE DEAD MAN, SEEMS TO ME PREPOSTEROUS, EVEN INSANE.



WHEN MAN FORGETS HE IS MORTAL, HE FEELS INCLINED TO DO GREAT THINGS, AND SOMETIMES SUCCEEDS. THIS OBLIVION, FRUIT OF EXCESS, IS AT THE SAME TIME THE CAUSE OF HIS WOES. “MORTAL, THINK AS A MORTAL.” ANTIQUITY INVENTED A TRAGIC MODESTY.



OF ALL THE EQUESTRIAN STATUES OF ROMAN EMPERORS, THE ONLY ONE TO SURVIVE THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS AND THE EROSION OF THE AGES IS THAT OF MARCUS AURELIUS—THE LEAST “EMPEROR” OF ALL AND THE ONE WHO WOULD HAVE ADAPTED HIMSELF TO ANY OTHER CONDITION.



GETTING UP WITH MY HEAD FULL OF PLANS, I WOULD BE WORKING, I WAS SURE OF IT, ALL MORNING LONG. NO SOONER HAD I SAT DOWN AT MY DESK THAN THE ODIOUS, VILE, AND PERSUASIVE REFRAIN: “WHAT DO YOU EXPECT OF THIS WORLD?” STOPPED ME SHORT. AND I RETURNED, AS USUAL, TO MY BED WITH THE HOPE OF FINDING SOME ANSWER, OF GOING BACK TO SLEEP. …



WE MAKE CHOICES, DECISIONS, AS LONG AS WE KEEP TO THE SURFACE OF THINGS; ONCE WE REACH THE DEPTHS, WE CAN NEITHER CHOOSE NOR DECIDE, WE CAN DO NOTHING BUT REGRET THE SURFACE….



THE FEAR OF BEING DECEIVED IS THE VULGAR VERSION OF THE QUEST FOR TRUTH.



WHEN YOU KNOW YOURSELF WELL AND DO NOT DESPISE YOURSELF UTTERLY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU ARE TOO EXHAUSTED TO INDULGE IN EXTREME FEELINGS.



IT IS A WITHERING PROCESS TO FOLLOW A DOCTRINE, A BELIEF, A SYSTEM—FOR A WRITER ESPECIALLY; UNLESS HE LIVES, AS OFTEN HAPPENS, IN CONTRADICTION WITH THE IDEAS TO WHICH HE APPEALS. THIS CONTRADICTION, OR THIS TREASON, STIMULATES HIM AND KEEPS HIM IN A STATE OF INSECURITY, EMBARRASSMENT, SHAME—CONDITIONS FAVORABLE TO PRODUCTION.



PARADISE WAS THE PLACE WHERE EVERYTHING WAS KNOWN BUT WHERE NOTHING WAS EXPLAINED. THE UNIVERSE BEFORE SIN—BEFORE COMMENTARY …



I HAVE NO FAITH, LUCKILY. IF I HAD, I SHOULD LIVE IN CONSTANT FEAR OF LOSING IT. HENCE, FAR FROM HELPING ME, IT WOULD DO NOTHING BUT INJURE ME.



AN IMPOSTOR, A “HUMBUG,” CONSCIOUS OF BEING SO AND THEREFORE A SELF-SPECTATOR, IS NECESSARILY MORE ADVANCED IN KNOWLEDGE THAN A STEADY MIND ‘FULL OF MERITS AND ALL OF A PIECE.



ANYONE POSSESSING A BODY IS ENTITLED TO BE CALLED A REPROBATE. IF HE IS AFFLICTED WITH A “SOUL” AS WELL, THERE IS NO ANATHEMA TO WHICH HE CANNOT LAY CLAIM.



HOW ARE WE TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE WHO HAS LOST EVERYTHING? WHAT LANGUAGE SHALL WE USE? THE MOST DIFFUSE, THE VAGUEST, WILL ALWAYS BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE.



SUPREMACY OF REGRET: THE ACTIONS WE HAVE NOT PERFORMED CONSTITUTE, BY THE VERY FACT THAT THEY PURSUE US AND THAT WE CONTINUALLY THINK ABOUT THEM, THE SOLE CONTENTS OF OUR CONSCIOUSNESS.



SOMETIMES I WISH I WERE A CANNIBAL—LESS’FOR THE PLEASURE OF EATING SOMEONE THAN FOR THE PLEASURE OF VOMITING HIM.”



NO LONGER WANTING TO BE A MAN …, DREAMING OF ANOTHER FORM OF FAILURE.



EACH TIME YOU FIND YOURSELF AT A TURNING-POINT, THE BEST THING IS TO LIE DOWN AND LET THE HOURS PASS. RESOLUTIONS MADE STANDING UP ARE WORTHLESS: THEY ARE DICTATED EITHER BY PRIDE OR BY FEAR. PRONE, WE STILL KNOW THESE TWO SCOURGES, BUT IN A MORE ATTENUATED, MORE INTEMPORAL FORM.



WHEN SOMEONE COMPLAINS THAT HIS LIFE HAS COME TO NOTHING, WE NEED MERELY REMIND HIM THAT LIFE ITSELF IS IN AN ANALOGOUS SITUATION, IF NOT WORSE.



WORKS DIE: FRAGMENTS, NOT HAVING LIVED, CANNOT DIE EITHER.



HORROR OF THE ACCESSORY PARALYZES ME. NOW, THE ACCESSORY IS THE ESSENCE OF COMMUNICATION (AND HENCE OF THOUGHT), IT IS THE FLESH AND BLOOD OF SPEECH AND WRITING. TRYING TO RENOUNCE IT IS LIKE FORNICATING WITH A SKELETON.



THE SATISFACTION WE TAKE FROM PERFORMING A TASK (ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE NO BELIEF IN THE TASK AND EVEN DISDAIN IT) SHOWS TO WHAT DEGREE WE STILL BELONG TO THE RABBLE.



MY MERIT IS NOT TO BE TOTALLY INEFFECTUAL BUT TO HAVE WANTED TO BE.



IF I DO NOT DENY MY ORIGINS, IT IS BECAUSE IT IS ULTIMATELY BETTER TO BE NOTHING AT ALL THAN A PRETENSE OF SOMETHING.



A MIXTURE OF AUTOMATISM AND WHIM, MAN IS A ROBOT WITH DEFECTS, A ROBOT OUT OF ORDER. IF ONLY HE REMAINS SO, AND IS NOT SOME DAY PUT RIGHT!



WHAT EVERY MAN, WHETHER HE HAS PATIENCE OR NOT, HAS ALWAYS EXPECTED IS, OF COURSE, DEATH. BUT HE KNOWS THIS ONLY WHEN DEATH COMES …, WHEN IT IS TOO LATE TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY IT.



MAN CERTAINLY BEGAN PRAYING LONG BEFORE HE KNEW HOW TO SPEAK, FOR THE PANGS HE MUST HAVE SUFFERED UPON LEAVING ANIMALITY, UPON DENYING IT, COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENDURED WITHOUT GRUNTS AND GROANS, PRÉFIGURATIONS, PREMONITORY SIGNS OF PRAYER.



IN ART AND IN EVERYTHING, THE COMMENTATOR IS GENERALLY BETTER INFORMED AND MORE LUCID THAN THE SUBJECT OF COMMENTARY. THIS IS THE ADVANTAGE THE MURDERER HAS OVER HIS VICTIM.



“LET US OFFER OUR THANKS TO THE GODS, WHO KEEP NO ONE IN THIS LIFE BY FORCE.” SENECA (WHOSE STYLE, ACCORDING TO CALIGULA, LACKS CEMENT) IS OPEN TO THE ESSENTIAL, AND THIS NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE OF HIS AFFILIATION WITH STOICISM AS BECAUSE OF HIS EIGHT-YEARS’ EXILE IN CORSICA, PARTICULARLY DESOLATE AT THE TIME. THIS ORDEAL CONFERRED UPON A FRIVOLOUS WRITER A DIMENSION HE WOULD NOT HAVE ACQUIRED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF EVENTS; IT RELIEVED HIM OF THE AID OF A SICKNESS.



MINE STILL, THIS MOMENT PASSES BY, ESCAPES ME, AND IS BURIED FOREVER. AM I GOING TO COMMIT MYSELF WITH THE NEXT? I MAKE UP MY MIND: IT IS HERE, IT BELONGS TO ME—AND ALREADY IS LONG SINCE PAST. FROM MORNING TO NIGHT, FABRICATING THE PAST!



AFTER HAVING, TO NO AVAIL, TRIED EVERYTHING AMONG THE MYSTICS, HE HAD ONLY ONE RECOURSE: TO FOUNDER IN WISDOM….



ONCE YOU ASK YOURSELF SO-CALLED PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTIONS AND EMPLOY THE INEVITABLE JARGON, YOU ASSUME A SUPERIOR, AGGRESSIVE MANNER, AND THIS IN A REALM WHERE, THE INSOLUBLE BEING DE RIGUEUR, HUMILITY SHOULD BE ALSO. THIS ANOMALY IS MERELY APPARENT: THE MORE FORMIDABLE THE QUESTIONS YOU CONFRONT, THE MORE YOU LOSE YOUR HEAD: ULTIMATELY YOU BESTOW ON YOURSELF THE DIMENSIONS THEY POSSESS. IF THE PRIDE OF THEOLOGIANS “STINKS” EVEN MORE THAN THAT’OF THE PHILOSOPHERS, IT IS BECAUSE ONE DECS NOT CONCERN ONESELF WITH GOD WITH IMPUNITY: ONE REACHES THE POINT OF ARROGATING TO ONESELF CERTAIN OF HIS ATTRIBUTES—THE WORST, OF COURSE.



AT PEACE WITH ITSELF AND THE WORLD, THE MIND ATROPHIES. IT FLOURISHES AT THE SLIGHTEST CONTRARIETY. THOUGHT IS REALLY NO MORE THAN THE SHAMELESS EXPLOITATION OF OUR EMBARRASSMENTS AND OUR DISGRACES.



THIS BODY, ONCE LOYAL, DISAVOWS ME, NO LONGER FOLLOWS ME, HAS CEASED TO BE MY ACCOMPLICE. REJECTED, BETRAYED, DISCARDED, WHAT WOULD BECOME OF ME IF OLD INFIRMITIES, TO PROVE THEIR ALLEGIANCE, DIDN’T COME TO KEEP ME COMPANY AT EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY AND NIGHT?



“DISTINGUISHED” PEOPLE DO NOT INVENT IN MATTERS OF LANGUAGE. ON THE CONTRARY, THE ONES WHO EXCEL THERE ARE THOSE WHO IMPROVISE OUT OF BOASTFULNESS OR WHO WALLOW IN A SENTIMENTAL COARSENESS. SUCH MEN ARE “NATURES,” THEY LIVE ON THE LEVEL OF WORDS. IS VERBAL GENIUS, THEN, THE CONCOMITANT OF LOW HAUNTS? IN ANY CASE, IT REQUIRES A CERTAIN MINIMUM OF ODIUM.



WE SHOULD KEEP TO A SINGLE LANGUAGE, AND DEEPEN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF IT AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. FOR A WRITER, GOSSIPING WITH A CONCIERGE IN HIS OWN IS MUCH MORE PROFITABLE THAN ARGUING WITH A SCHOLAR IN A FOREIGN TONGUE.



“… THE FEELING OF BEING EVERYTHING AND THE EVIDENCE OF BEING NOTHING.” I HAPPENED ACROSS THIS PHRASE IN MY YOUTH, AND WAS OVERWHELMED BY IT. EVERYTHING I FELT IN THOSE DAYS, AND EVERYTHING I WOULD FEEL FROM THEN ON, WAS SUMMED UP IN THIS EITRAORDINARY BANAL FORMULA, THE SYNTHESIS OF EXPANSION AND FAILURE, ECSTASY AND IMPASSE. MOST OFTEN IT IS NOT IN A PARADOX BUT IN A TRUISM THAT A REVELATION APPEARS.



POETRY EXCLUDES CALCULATION AND PREMEDITATION: IT IS INCOMPLETION, FOREBODING, ABYSS. NEITHER A SINGSONG GEOMETRY, NOR A SUCCESSION OF BLOODLESS ADJECTIVES. WE ARE TOO DEEPLY WOUNDED AND TOO DESPONDENT, TOO WEARY AND TOO BARBAROUS IN OUR WEARINESS, TO APPRECIATE, YET, THE CRAFT.



WE CANNOT DO WITHOUT THE NOTION OF PROGRESS, YET IT DOES NOT DESERVE OUR ATTENTION. IT IS LIKE THE “MEANING” OF LIFE. LIFE MUST HAVE ONE. BUT IS THERE ANY WHICH DOES NOT TURN OUT, UPON EXAMINATION, TO BE LUDICROUS?



TREES ARE MASSACRED, HOUSES GO UP—FACES, FACES EVERYWHERE. MAN IS SPREADING. MAN IS THE CANCER OF THE EARTH.



THERE IS SOMETHING ENVELOPING AND VOLUPTUOUS ABOUT THE NOTION OF FATALITY: IT KEEPS YOU WARM.



A TROGLODYTE THAT WILL HAVE PASSED THROUGH ALL THE NUANCES OF SATIETY….



THE PLEASURE OF SLANDERING YOURSELF GREATLY EXCEEDS THAT OF BEING SLANDERED.



BETTER THAN ANYONE I KNOW THE DANGER OF BEING BORN WITH A THIRST FOR EVERYTHING. A POISONED GIFT, A VENGEANCE OF PROVIDENCE. THUS ENCUMBERED, I COULD GET NOWHERE, ON THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL, OF COURSE, THE ONLY ONE THAT MATTERS. ANYTHING BUT ACCIDENTAL, MY FAILURE IS IDENTIFIED WITH MY ESSENCE.



THE MYSTICS AND THEIR “COLLECTED WORKS.” WHEN ONE ADDRESSES ONESELF TO GOD, AND TO GOD ALONE, AS THEY CLAIM TO DO, ONE SHOULD BE CAREFUL NOT TO WRITE. GOD DOESN’T READ….



EACH TIME I THINK OF THE ESSENTIAL, I SEEM TO GLIMPSE IT IN SILENCE OR EXPLOSION, IN STUPOR OR EXCLAMATION. NEVER IN SPEECH.



WHEN YOU MEDITATE ALL DAY ON THE INOPPORTUNENESS OF BIRTH, EVERYTHING YOU PLAN AND EVERYTHING YOU PERFORM SEEMS PATHETIC, FUTILE. YOU ARE LIKE A MADMAN WHO, CURED, DOES NOTHING BUT THINK OF THE CRISIS FROM WHICH HE HAS EMERGED, THE “DREAM” HE HAS LEFT BEHIND; HE KEEPS HARKING BACK TO IT, SO THAT HIS CURE IS OF NO BENEFIT TO HIM WHATEVER.



THE APPETITE FOR TORMENT IS FOR SOME WHAT THE LURE OF GAIN IS FOR OTHERS.



MAN STARTED OUT ON THE WRONG FOOT. THE MISADVENTURE IN PARADISE WAS THE FIRST CONSEQUENCE. THE REST HAD TO FOLLOW.



I SHALL NEVER UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN LIVE KNOWING THAT WE ARE NOT—TO SAY THE LEAST!—ETERNAL.



THE IDEAL BEING? AN ANGEL RAVAGED BY HUMOR.



WHEN, AFTER A SERIES OF QUESTIONS ABOUT DESIRE, DISGUST, AND SERENITY, BUDDHA WAS ASKED: “WHAT IS THE GOAL, THE FINAL MEANING OF NIRVANA?” HE DID NOT ANSWER. HE SMILED. THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF COMMENTARY ON THAT SMILE, INSTEAD OF SEEING IT AS A NORMAL REACTION TO A POINTLESS QUESTION. IT IS WHAT WE DO WHEN CONFRONTED BY A CHILD’S WHY. WE SMILE, BECAUSE NO ANSWER IS CONCEIVABLE, BECAUSE THE ANSWER WOULD BE EVEN MORE MEANINGLESS THAN THE QUESTION. CHILDREN ADMIT NO LIMITS TO ANYTHING; THEY ALWAYS WANT TO SEE BEYOND, TO SEE WHAT THERE IS AFTERWARD. BUT THERE IS NO AFTERWARD. NIRVANA IS A LIMIT, THE LIMIT IT IS ITERATION, SUPREME IMPASSE….



EXISTENCE MIGHT WELL HAVE HAD SOME ATTRACTION BEFORE THE ADVENT OF NOISE—LET US SAY, BEFORE THE NEOLITHIC AGE. WHEN WILL HE COME, THE MAN WHO CAN RID US OF ALL MEN?



FOR ALL WE TELL OURSELVES’ ABOUT NOT OUTLIVING A STILLBORN BABE, INSTEAD OF CLEARING OUT AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY, WE CLING, WITH LUNATIC ENERGY, TO ONE DAY MORE.



LUCIDITY DOCS NOT EXTIRPATE THE DESIRE TO LIVE—FAR FROM IT, LUCIDITY MERELY MAKES US UNSUITED TO LIFE.



GOD: A DISEASE WE IMAGINE WE ARE CURED OF BECAUSE NO ONE DIES OF IT NOWADAYS.



UNCONSCIOUSNESS IS THE SECRET, THE “VITAL PRINCIPLE” OF LIFE…. IT IS THE SOLE RECOURSE AGAINST THE SELF, AGAINST THE DISEASE OF BEING INDIVIDUALIZED, AGAINST THE DEBILITATING EFFECT OF THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS, A STATE SO FORMIDABLE, SO DEMANDING, THAT IT MUST BE RESERVED FOR ATHLETES ALONE.



ANY SUCCESS, IN ANY REALM, INVOLVES AN INNER IMPOVERISHMENT IT MAKES US FORGET WHAT WE ARE, IT DEPRIVES US OF THE TORMENT OF OUR LIMITS.



I HAVE NEVER TAKEN MYSELF FOR A BEING. A NON-CITIZEN, A MARGINAL TYPE, A NOTHING WHO EXISTS ONLY BY THE EXCESS, BY THE SUPERABUNDANCE OF HIS NOTHINGNESS.



TO HAVE FOUNDERED SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE EPIGRAM AND THE SIGH!



SUFFERING OPENS OUR EYES, HELPS US TO SEE WHAT WE WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN OTHERWISE. HENCE IT IS USEFUL ONLY TO KNOWLEDGE AND, EXCEPT FOR THAT, SERVES ONLY TO POISON EXISTENCE. WHICH, ONE MAY ADD IN PASSING, FAVORS KNOWLEDGE FURTHER. “HE HAS SUFFERED—HENCE HE HAS UNDERSTOOD.” THIS IS ALL WE CAN SAY OF A VICTIM OF DISEASE, INJUSTICE, OR OF ANY KIND OF MISFORTUNE. SUFFERING IMPROVES NO ONE (EXCEPT THOSE WHO WERE ALREADY GOOD), IT IS FORGOTTEN AS ALL THINGS ARE FORGOTTEN, IT DOES NOT ENTER INTO “HUMANITY’S PATRIMONY” NOR PRESERVE ITSELF IN ANY WAY AT ALL—IT WASTES ITSELF AS EVERYTHING IS WASTED. ONCE AGAIN, IT SERVES ONLY TO OPEN OUR EYES.



MAN HAS SAID WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. HE SHOULD REST NOW. BUT REFUSES, AND THOUGH HE HAS ENTERED INTO HIS “SURVIVOR” PHASE, HE FIDGETS AS IF HE WERE ON THE THRESHOLD OF AN ASTONISHING CAREER.



A CRY MEANS SOMETHING ONLY IN A CREATED UNIVERSE. IF THERE IS NO CREATOR, WHAT IS THE GOOD OF CALLING ATTENTION TO YOURSELF?



NERVAL: “HAVING REACHED THE PLACE DE LA CONCORDE, MY THOUGHT WAS TO KILL MYSELF” NOTHING IN ALL FRENCH LITERATURE HAS HAUNTED ME AS MUCH AS THAT.



IN EVERYTHING, ONLY THE BEGINNING AND THE OUTCOME MATTER, DOING AND UNDOING. THE WAY TOWARD BEING AND THE WAY OUT OF BEING—THAT IS BREATHING, WHEREAS BEING AS SUCH IS MERELY AN ASPHYXIATOR.



WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME, I AM CONVINCED THAT MY FIRST YEARS WERE A PARADISE. BUT I AM UNDOUBTEDLY MISTAKEN. IF THERE WAS EVER A PARADISE, I MUST LOOK FOR IT EARLIER THAN ALL MY YEARS.



A GOLDEN RULE: TO LEAVE AN INCOMPLETE IMAGE OF ONESELF …



THE MORE MAN IS MAN, THE MORE HE LOSES IN REALITY: IT IS THE PRICE HE MUST PAY FOR HIS DISTINCT ESSENCE. IF HE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE THE LIMITS OF HIS SINGULARITY, IF HE WERE TO BECOME MAN TOTALLY, ABSOLUTELY, THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE ANYTHING IN HIM WHICH WOULD SUGGEST ANY KIND OF EXISTENCE AT ALL.

SILENCE IN THE FACE OF THE DECREES OF FATE, THE REDISCOVERY, AFTER CENTURIES OF THUNDERING PRAYER, OF THE ANCIENT BE STILL—THERE IS OUR ASPIRATION, THERE OUR STRUGGLE, IF SUCH A WORD IS APPROPRIATE TO A FORESEEN AND ACCEPTED DEFEAT.



EVERY SUCCESS IS IGNOMINIOUS; WE NEVER GET OVER IT—IN OUR OWN EYES, OF COURSE.



THE PANGS OF TRUTH ABOUT OURSELVES ARE MORE THAN WE CAN ENDURE. HOW PITIABLE THE MAN (IF SUCH A BEING EXISTS) WHO NO LONGER LIES TO HIMSELF!



I SHALL NO LONGER READ THE SAGES—THEY HAVE DONE ME TOO MUCH HARM. I SHOULD HAVE SURRENDERED TO MY INSTINCTS, LET MY MADNESS FLOURISH. I HAVE DONE JUST THE OPPOSITE, I HAVE PUT ON THE MASK OF REASON, AND THE MASK HAS ENDED BY REPLACING MY FACE AND USURPING ALL THE REST.



IN MY MOMENTS OF MEGALOMANIA, I TELL MYSELF THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE MY DIAGNOSES SHOULD BE MISTAKEN, THAT I HAVE ONLY TO BE PATIENT, TO WAIT UNTIL THE END, UNTIL THE ADVENT OF THE LAST MAN, THE ONE BEING IN A POSITION TO SUBSTANTIATE ME….



THE NOTION THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER NEVER TO EXIST IS AMONG THOSE WHICH MEET WITH THE MOST OPPOSITION. EVERY MAN, INCAPABLE OF SEEING HIMSELF EXCEPT FROM INSIDE, REGARDS HIMSELF AS NECESSARY, EVEN INDISPENSABLE, EVERY MAN FEELS AND PERCEIVES HIMSELF AS AN ABSOLUTE REALITY, AS A WHOLE, AS THE WHOLE. THE MOMENT WE IDENTIFY OURSELVES ENTIRELY WITH OUR OWN BEING, WE REACT LIKE GOD, WE ARE GOD.

IT IS ONLY WHEN WE LIVE AT ONCE WITHIN AND ON THE MARGINS OF OURSELVES THAT WE CAN CONCEIVE, QUITE CALMLY, THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PREFERABLE THAT THE ACCIDENT WE ARE SHOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED.



IF I FOLLOWED MY NATURAL INCLINATION, I SHOULD BLOW UP THE WORLD. AND IT IS BECAUSE I LACK THE COURAGE TO FOLLOW IT THAT, OUT OF PENITENCE, I TRY TO STUPEFY MYSELF WITH THE COMPANY OF THOSE WHO HAVE FOUND PEACE.



A WRITER HAS LEFT HIS MARK ON US NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE READ HIM A GREAT DEAL BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE THOUGHT OF HIM MORE THAN IS WARRANTED. I HAVE NOT FREQUENTED BAUDELAIRE OR PASCAL PARTICULARLY, BUT I HAVE NOT STOPPED THINKING OF THEIR MISERIES, WHICH HAVE ACCOMPANIED ME EVERYWHERE AS FAITHFULLY AS MY OWN.



AT EACH AGE, MORE OR LESS DISTINCT SIGNS WARN US THAT IT IS TIME TO DECAMP. WE HESITATE, WE PROCRASTINATE, CONVINCED THAT, ONCE OLD AGE HAS COME AT LAST, THESE SIGNS WILL BECOME SO CLEAR THAT ANY FURTHER VACILLATION WOULD BE UNSUITABLE. CLEAR THEY ARE, INDEED, BUT WE LACK SUFFICIENT VIGOR TO PERFORM THE ONE DECENT ACTION A LIVING MAN CAN COMMIT.



OUR PHYSIOLOGICAL MISERIES HELP US TO ENVISAGE THE FUTURE WITH SOME CONFIDENCE: THEY DISPENSE US FROM TORMENTING OURSELVES OVERMUCH, THEY DO THEIR TEST SO THAT NONE OF OUR LONG-RANGE PROJECTS HAS TIME TO WEAR OUT ALL OUR AVAILABLE ENERGIES.



THE EMPIRE WAS FALLING, THE BARBARIANS WERE ON THE MOVE…. WHAT WAS TO BE DONE, EXCEPT TO ESCAPE THE AGE? HAPPY MOMENT, WHEN THERE WAS STILL SOMEWHERE TO GO, WHEN THE EMPTY PLACES WERE ACCESSIBLE AND WELCOMING! WE HAVE BEEN DISPOSSESSED OF EVERYTHING, EVEN THE DESERT.



FOR THE MAN WHO HAS GOT IN THE NASTY HABIT OF UNMASKING APPEARANCES, EVENT AND MISUNDERSTANDING ARE SYNONYMS. TO MAKE FOR THE ESSENTIAL IS TO THROW UP THE GAME, TO ADMIT ONE IS DEFEATED.



X IS UNDOUBTEDLY RIGHT TO COMPARE HIMSELF TO A “VOLCANO,” BUT WRONG TO GO INTO DETAILS.



THE POOR, BY THINKING UNCEASINGLY OF MONEY, REACH THE POINT OF LOSING THE SPIRITUAL ADVANTAGES OF NON-POSSESSION, THEREBY SINKING AS LOW AS THE RICH.



THE EARLY GREEKS REGARDED THE PSYCHE AS NO MORE THAN AIR, WIND, OR AT TEST SMOKE, AND ONE READILY AGREES WITH THEM EVERY TIME ONE WEARIES OF FORAGING IN ONE’S OWN EGO OR THAT OF OTHERS, SEARCHING FOR STRANGE AND, IF POSSIBLE, SUSPECT DEPTHS.



THE FINAL STEP TOWARD INDIFFERENCE IS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE VERY NOTION OF INDIFFERENCE.



WALKING IN A FOREST BETWEEN TWO HEDGES OF FERNS TRANSFIGURED BY AUTUMN—THAT IS A TRIUMPH. WHAT ARE OVATIONS AND APPLAUSE BESIDE IT?



TO DEPRECATE YOUR OWN KIND, TO VILIFY AND PULVERIZE THEM, TO ATTACK THEIR FOUNDATIONS, TO UNDERMINE YOUR VERY BASIS, TO DESTROY YOUR POINT OF DEPARTURE, TO PUNISH YOUR ORIGINS …, TO CURSE ALL THOSE NON-ELECT, LESSER BREEDS, TORN BETWEEN IMPOSTURE AND ELEGY, WHOSE SOLE MISSION IS NOT TO HAVE ONE …



HAVING DESTROYED ALL MY CONNECTIONS, BURNED MY BRIDGES, I SHOULD FEEL A CERTAIN FREEDOM, AND IN FACT I DO, ONE SO INTENSE I AM AFRAID TO REJOICE IN IT.



WHEN THE HABIT OF SEEING THINGS AS THEY ARE TURNS INTO A MANIA, WE LAMENT THE MADMAN WE HAVE BEEN AND ARE NO LONGER.

SOMEONE WE REGARD HIGHLY COMES CLOSER TO US WHEN HE PERFORMS AN ACTION UNWORTHY OF HIM—THEREBY HE RELEASES US FROM THE CALVARY OF VENERATION. AND STARTING FROM THAT MOMENT WE FEEL A TRUE ATTACHMENT TO HIM.



NOTHING IS WORSE THAN THE COARSENESS AND MEANNESS WE PERPETRATE OUT OF TIMIDITY.



FACED WITH THE NILE AND THE PYRAMIDS, FLAUBERT THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT NORMANDY, ACCORDING TO ONE WITNESS—NOTHING BUT THE LANDSCAPES AND MANNERS OF THE FUTURE MADAME BOVARY. NOTHING BUT THAT SEEMED TO EXIST FOR HIM. TO IMAGINE IS TO LIMIT ONESELF, TO EXCLUDE: WITHOUT AN EXCESSIVE CAPACITY FOR REJECTION, NO PLAN, NO WORK, NO WAY OF REALIZING ANYTHING.



WHAT IN ANY WAY RESEMBLES A VICTORY SEEMS TO ME SO DISHONORABLE THAT I CAN DO BATTLE, IN WHATEVER CIRCUMSTANCE, ONLY WITH THE FIRM INTENTION OF GAINING THE UNDER HAND. I HAVE PASSED THE STAGE WHERE BEINGS MATTER, AND I SEE NO REASON TO STRUGGLE IN KNOWN WORLDS.



PHILOSOPHY IS TAUGHT ONLY IN THE AGORA, IN A GARDEN, OR AT HOME. THE LECTURE CHAIR IS THE GRAVE OF PHILOSOPHY, THE DEATH OF ANY LIVING THOUGHT, THE DAIS IS THE MIND IN MOURNING.



THAT I CAN STILL DESIRE PROVES THAT I LACK AN EXACT PERCEPTION OF REALITY, THAT I AM DISTRACTED, THAT I AM A THOUSAND MILES FROM THE TRUTH. “MAN,” WE READ IN THE DHAMMAPADA, “IS PREY TO DESIRE ONLY BECAUSE HE DOES NOT SEE THINGS AS THEY ARE.”



I WAS SHAKING WITH RAGE: MY HONOR WAS AT STAKE. THE HOURS PASSED, DAWN WAS APPROACHING. WAS I GOING TO RUIN MY NIGHT BECAUSE OF A TRIFLE? TRY AS I WOULD TO MINIMIZE THE INCIDENT, THE REASONS I INVENTED TO CALM MYSELF REMAINED INEFFECTUAL. THAT ANYONE WOULD DARE DO SUCH A THING TO ME! I WAS ON THE POINT OF OPENING THE WINDOW AND SCREAMING LIKE A MADMAN, WHEN THE IMAGE OF OUR PLANET SPINNING LIKE A TOP SUDDENLY SEIZED MY MIND. MY ANGER SUBSIDED AT ONCE.



DEATH IS NOT ALTOGETHER USELESS: AFTER ALL, IT IS BECAUSE OF DEATH THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO RECUPERATE THE PRENATAL SPACE, OUR ONLY SPACE….



HOW RIGHT IT WAS TO BEGIN THE DAY, AS MEN ONCE DID, WITH A PRAYER, A CALL FOR HELP! IGNORANT OF WHOM TO ADDRESS OURSELVES TO, WE WILL END BY GROVELING BEFORE THE FIRST CRACKED GOD TO COME ALONG.



ACUTE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HAVING A BODY—THAT IS THE ABSENCE OF HEALTH…. WHICH IS AS MUCH AS TO SAY THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN WELL



EVERYTHING IS DECEPTION—I’VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT YET THIS CERTITUDE HAS AFFORDED ME NO RELIEF, EXCEPT AT THE MOMENTS WHEN IT WAS VIOLENTLY PRESENT TO MY MIND….



THE PERCEPTION OF THE PRECARIOUS RAISED TO THE LEVEL OF VISION, OF MYSTICAL EXPERIENCE.



THE ONLY WAY OF ENDURING ONE DISASTER AFTER THE NEXT IS TO LOVE THE VERY IDEA OF DISASTER: IF WE SUCCEED, THERE ARE NO FURTHER SURPRISES, WE ARE SUPERIOR TO WHATEVER OCCURS, WE ARE INVINCIBLE VICTIMS.



IN VERY POWERFUL SENSATIONS OF PAIN, MUCH MORE THAN IN VERY SLIGHT ONES, WE OBSERVE OURSELVES, WE DIVIDE INTO AN EXTERNAL WITNESS AND THE MOANING, SCREAMING SUFFERER. EVERYTHING WHICH BORDERS ON TORMENT WAKENS THE PSYCHOLOGIST IN EACH OF US, AS WELL AS THE EXPERIMENTER: WE WANT TO SEE HOW FER WE CAN GO IN THE INTOLERABLE.



WHAT IS INJUSTICE COMPARED TO DISEASE? TRUE, WE MAY FIND IT UNJUST TO BE SICK. MOREOVER THAT IS HOW EACH OF US REACTS, WITHOUT TROUBLING AS TO WHETHER HE IS RIGHT OR WRONG. SICKNESS IS: NOTHING MORE REAL THAN DISEASE. IF WE CALL IT UNJUST, WE MUST DARE TO DO AS MUCH WITH BEING ITSELF—WE MUST SPEAK, THEN, OF THE INJUSTICE OF EXISTING.



THE CREATION, AS IT WAS, AMOUNTED TO LITTLE ENOUGH; TINKERED WITH, IT WAS WORTH STILL LESS. IF ONLY IT HAD TEEN LEFT TO ITS TRUTH, ITS PRIMAL NULLITY! THE MESSIAH TO COME—THE REAL ONE—IS UNDERSTANDABLY SLOW ABOUT PUTTING IN AN APPEARANCE. THE TASK THAT AWAITS HIM IS NOT GOING TO TE AN EASY ONE: HOW WILL HE MANAGE TO DELIVER HUMANITY FROM THE MANIA OF AMELIORATION?



WHEN, GETTING TOO USED TO OURSELVES, WE BEGIN TO LOATHE OURSELVES, WE SOON REALIZE THAT WE ARE WORSE OFF, THAT SELF HATRED ACTUALLY STRENGTHENS SELF ATTACHMENT



I DO NOT INTERRUPT HIM, I LET HIM WEIGH EACH MAN’S MERITS, WAITING FOR HIM TO TELL ME OFF…. HIS INCOMPREHENSION OF OTHERS IS ASTOUNDING. SUBTLE AND INGENUOUS BOTH, HE JUDGES YOU AS IF YOU WERE AN ENTITY OR A CATEGORY. TIME HAVING HAD NO HOLD OVER HIM, HE CANNOT ADMIT THAT I AM OUTSIDE OF WHATEVER HE FORBIDS, THAT NOTHING OF WHAT HE FAVORS STILL CONCERNS ME. DIALOGUE BECOMES POINTLESS WITH SOMEONE WHO ESCAPES THE PROCESSION OF THE YEARS. I ASK THOSE I LOVE TO BE KIND ENOUGH TO GROW OLD.



PANIC IN THE FACE OF ANYTHING—OF PRESENCE, OF THE VOID, OF ANYTHING. ORIGINAL PANIC.



GOD IS, EVEN IF HE ISN’T.



D IS INCAPABLE OF ASSIMILATING EVIL. HE ACKNOWLEDGES ITS EXISTENCE, BUT CANNOT INCORPORATE IT INTO HIS MIND. IF HE WERE TO EMERGE FROM HELL HE WOULD BE OBLIVIOUS OF HIS WHEREABOUTS, SO REMOTE IS HE IN HIS THINKING FROM WHAT FALLS AFOUL…. NOT THE FAINTEST TRACE OF ALL HE HAS ENDURED IN HIS IDEAS. OCCASIONALLY HE HAS REFLEXES—NO MORE THAN THAT—THE REFLEXES OF A WOUNDED MAN. CLOSED TO THE NEGATIVE, HE DOES NOT DISCERN THAT ALL WE POSSESS IS MERELY A CAPITAL OF NON-BEING. YET MORE THAN ONE OF HIS GESTURES REVEALS A DEMONIC SPIRIT—DEMONIC UNAWARES. HE IS A DESTROYER OBSCURED AND STERILIZED BY GOOD.



CURIOSITY TO MEASURE OUR PROGRESS INTO FAILURE IS THE ONLY REASON WE HAVE TO GROW OLDER. WC THOUGHT WE HAD REACHED THE LIMIT, WE THOUGHT THE HORIZON WAS BLOCKED FOREVER, WE LAMENTED IN THE THRALL OF OUR DISCOURAGEMENT AND NOW WE REALIZE THAT WE CAN FALL STILL LOWER, THAT THERE IS SOMETHING NEW, THAT ALL HOPE IS NOT LOST, THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO SINK A LITTLE FURTHER AND THUS TO POSTPONE THE DANGER OF GETTING STUCK, EVEN PARALYZED….



“LIFE SEEMS GOOD ONLY TO THE MADMAN,” OBSERVED HEGESIAS, A CYRCNAIC PHILOSOPHER, SOME TWENTY-THREE CENTURIES AGO. THESE ARE ALMOST THE ONLY WORDS OF HIS WE HAVE…. OF ALL OEUVRES TO REINVENT, HIS COMES FIRST ON MY LIST.



NO ONE APPROACHES THE CONDITION OF A SAGE IF HE HAS NOT HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO BE FORGOTTEN IN HIS LIFETIME.



TO THINK IS TO UNDERMINE—TO UNDERMINE ONESELF. ACTION INVOLVES FEWER RISKS, FOR IT FILLS THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THINGS AND OURSELVES, WHEREAS REFLECTION DANGEROUSLY WIDENS IT.

… SO LONG AS I GIVE MYSELF UP TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE, MANUAL LABOR, I AM HAPPY, FULFILLED; ONCE I STOP, I AM SEIZED BY DIZZINESS, AND I CAN THINK OF NOTHING BUT GIVING UP FOR GOOD.



AT THE LOWEST POINT OF OURSELVES, WHEN WE TOUCH BOTTOM AND FEEL THE ABYSS, WE ARE SUDDENLY RAISED UP—DEFENSE-REACTION OR ABSURD PRIDE—BY THE SENSE OF BEING SUPERIOR TO GOD. THE GRANDIOSE AND IMPURE ASPECT OF THE TEMPTATION TO BE DONE WITH IT ALL.



A BROADCAST ABOUT WOLVES, WITH RECORDINGS OF THEIR HOWLS. WHAT A LANGUAGE! THE MOST HEARTRENDING I KNOW, AND I SHALL NEVER FORGET IT. FROM NOW ON, IN MOMENTS OF EXCESSIVE SOLITUDE, I NEED MERELY RECALL THOSE SOUNDS TO HAVE THE SENSE OF BELONGING TO A COMMUNITY.



FROM THE MOMENT DEFEAT WAS IN SIGHT, HITLER SPOKE OF NOTHING BUT VICTORY. HE BELIEVED IN IT—HE BEHAVED, IN ANY CASE, AS IF HE BELIEVED IN IT—AND REMAINED TO THE END WALLED UP IN HIS OPTIMISM, HIS FAITH. EVERYTHING WAS CRUMBLING AROUND HIM, EVERY DAY BELIED HIS HOPES BUT, PERSISTING IN HIS TRUST IN THE IMPOSSIBLE, BLINDING HIMSELF AS ONLY THE INCURABLE CAN, HE HAD THE STRENGTH TO GO ON TO THE END, TO INVENT ONE HORROR AFTER THE NEXT, AND TO CONTINUE BEYOND HIS MADNESS, EVEN BEYOND HIS DESTINY. WHICH IS WHY WE CAN SAY OF HIM—OF THE MAN WHO FAILED SO UTTERLY—THAT HE REALIZED HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MORTAL.



“APRÀ MOI LE DÉLUGE” IS THE UNAVOWED MOTTO OF EVERY PERSON: IF WE ADMIT THAT OTHERS SURVIVE US, IT IS IN THE HOPE THAT THEY WILL BE PUNISHED FOR IT.



A ZOOLOGIST WHO OBSERVED GORILLAS IN THEIR NATIVE HABITAT WAS AMAZED BY THE UNIFORMITY OF THEIR LIFE AND THEIR VAST IDLENESS. HOURS AND HOURS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING … WAS BOREDOM UNKNOWN TO THEM?

THIS IS INDEED A QUESTION RAISED BY A HUMAN, A BUSY APE. FAR FROM FLEEING MONOTONY, ANIMALS CRAVE IT, AND WHAT THEY MOST DREAD IS TO SEE IT END. FOR IT ENDS ONLY TO BE REPLACED BY FEAR, THE CAUSE OF ALL ACTIVITY.

INACTION IS DIVINE; YET IT IS AGAINST INACTION THAT MAN HAS REBELLED. MAN ALONE, IN NATURE, IS INCAPABLE OF ENDURING MONOTONY, MAN ALONE WANTS SOMETHING TO HAPPEN AT ALL COSTS—SOMETHING, ANYTHING…. THEREBY HE SHOWS HIMSELF UNWORTHY OF HIS ANCESTOR: THE NEED FOR NOVELTY IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF AN ALIENATED GORILLA.



WE COME CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE UNBREATHABLE. WHEN WE HAVE REACHED IT, THAT WILL BE THE GREAT DAY. ALAS, WE ARE ONLY ON THE EVE. …



A NATION ACHIEVES AND RETAINS PRE-EMINENCE AS LONG AS IT ACCEPTS CONVENTIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARILY CLUMSY, AS LONG AS IT IS GIVEN OVER TO PREJUDICES WITHOUT REGARDING THEM AS SUCH. ONCE IT CALLS THEM BY THEIR NAME, EVERYTHING IS UNMASKED, EVERYTHING IS COMPROMISED.

TO SEEK TO RULE, TO TAKE A ROLE, TO MAKE THE LAW—SUCH THINGS CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT A POWERFUL DOSE OF STUPIDITY: HISTORY, IN ITS ESSENCE, IS STUPID. … IT CONTINUES, IT ADVANCES, BECAUSE THE NATIONS LIQUIDATE THEIR PREJUDICES ONE AFTER THE OTHER. IF THEY WERE TO BE RID OF THEM ALL AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING LEFT BUT A BLESSED UNIVERSAL DISINTEGRATION.



ONE CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT MOTIVES. I HAVE NO MOTIVES LEFT, AND I AM LIVING.



I WAS IN PERFECT HEALTH, I FELT BETTER THAN EVER. SUDDENLY I WAS COLD, SO COLD THAT I WAS SURE THERE WAS NO CURE FOR IT. WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO ME? YET THIS WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAD BEEN IN THE GRIP OF SUCH A SENSATION. BUT IN THE PAST I HAD ENDURED IT WITHOUT TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. THIS TIME I WANTED TO KNOW, AND NOW. … I ABANDONED ONE HYPOTHESIS AFTER THE NEXT: IT COULD NOT BE SICKNESS; NOT THE SHADOW OF A SYMPTOM TO CLING TO. WHAT WAS I TO DO? I WAS BAFFLED, INCAPABLE OF FINDING EVEN THE TRACE OF AN EXPLANATION, WHEN AN IDEA OCCURRED TO ME—AND THIS WAS A REAL RELIEF—THAT WHAT I WAS FEELING WAS MERELY A VERSION OF THE GREAT, FINAL COLD—THAT IT WAS SIMPLY DEATH EXERCISING, REHEARSING….



IN PARADISE, OBJECTS AND BEINGS, ASSAULTED BY LIGHT FROM ALL SIDES, CAST NO SHADOW. WHICH IS TO SAY THAT THEY LACK REALITY, LIKE ANYTHING THAT IS UNBROACHED BY DARKNESS AND DESERTED BY DEATH.



OUR FIRST INTUITIONS ARE THE TRUE ONES. WHAT I THOUGHT OF SO MANY THINGS IN MY FIRST YOUTH SEEMS TO ME INCREASINGLY RIGHT, AND AFTER SO MANY DETOURS AND DISTRACTIONS, I NOW COME BACK TO IT, AGGRIEVED THAT I COULD HAVE ERECTED MY EXISTENCE ON THE RUIN OF THOSE REVELATIONS.



I REMEMBER A PLACE I HAVE BEEN ONLY IF I HAVE HAD THE LUCK TO EXPERIENCE UTTER MISERY THERE.



AT THE STREET FAIR, WATCHING A TUMBLER GRIMACING, SHOUTING, EXHAUSTING HIMSELF, I TOLD MYSELF THAT HE WAS DOING HIS DUTY, WHEREAS I WAS EVADING MINE….



TO MANIFEST ONESELF, TO PRODUCE IN ANY REALM IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF A MORE OR LESS CAMOUFLAGED FANATIC. IF WE DO NOT REGARD OURSELVES AS ENTRUSTED WITH A MISSION, EXISTENCE IS DIFFICULT; ACTION, IMPOSSIBLE.



THE CERTITUDE THAT THERE IS NO SALVATION IS A FORM OF SALVATION, IN FACT IT IS SALVATION. STARTING FROM HERE, WE MIGHT ORGANIZE OUR OWN LIFE AS WELL AS CONSTRUCT A PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY: THE INSOLUBLE AS SOLUTION, AS THE ONLY WAY OUT….



MY WEAKNESSES HAVE SPOILED MY EXISTENCE, BUT IT IS THANKS TO THEM THAT I EXIST, THAT I IMAGINE I EXIST.



MAN INTERESTS ME ONLY SINCE HE HAS CEASED TO BELIEVE IN HIMSELF. WHILE HE WAS IN HIS ASCENDING PHASE, HE DESERVED NO MORE THAN INDIFFERENCE. NOW HE PROVOKES A NEW SENTIMENT, A SPECIAL SYMPATHY: COMPASSIONATE HORROR.



FOR ALL THE SUPERSTITIONS AND SHACKLES I HAVE RID MYSELF OF, I CANNOT REGARD MYSELF AS A FREE MAN, REMOTE FROM EVERYTHING. A MANIA FOR DESISTANCE, HAVING SURVIVED THE OTHER PASSIONS, REFUSES TO LEAVE ME: IT TORMENTS ME, IT PERSEVERES, IT DEMANDS THAT I CONTINUE RENOUNCING, WITHDRAWING. BUT FROM WHAT? WHAT IS LEFT TO REJECT? I PONDER THE QUESTION. MY ROLE IS OVER, MY CAREER FINISHED, AND YET NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN MY LIFE, I AM AT THE SAME POINT IN IT, I MUST STILL DESIST, STILL AND FOREVER.

NO POSITION IS SO FALSE AS HAVING UNDERSTOOD AND STILL REMAINING ALIVE.



WHEN WE CONSIDER COLDLY THAT PORTION OF DURATION GRANTED TO EACH OF US, IT SEEMS EQUALLY SATISFACTORY AND EQUALLY LUDICROUS, WHETHER IT LASTS A DAY OR A CENTURY.

“I’VE HAD MY TIME”—NO EXPRESSION CAN BE UTTERED MORE APPROPRIATELY AT ANY MOMENT OF LIFE, INCLUDING THE FIRST.



DEATH IS THE PROVIDENCE OF THOSE WHO WILL HAVE HAD THE TASTE AND THE TALENT FOR FIASCO—THE RECOMPENSE OF ALL WHO HAVE COME TO NOTHING, WHO WANTED NOT TO…. IT WARRANTS THEM, IT IS THEIR WAY OF WINNING. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOR THE OTHERS, THOSE WHO HAVE LABORED TO SUCCEED, AND WHO HAVE SUCCEEDED: WHAT A DENIAL, WHAT A SLAP IN THE FACE!



AN EGYPTIAN MONK, AFTER FIFTEEN YEARS OF COMPLETE SOLITUDE, RECEIVED A PACKET OF LETTERS FROM HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS. HE DID NOT OPEN THEM, HE FLUNG THEM INTO THE FIRE IN ORDER TO ESCAPE THE ASSAULT OF MEMORY. WE CANNOT SUSTAIN COMMUNION WITH OURSCLF AND OUR THOUGHTS IF WE ALLOW GHOSTS TO APPEAR, TO PREVAIL. THE DESERT SIGNIFIES NOT SO MUCH A NEW LIFE AS THE DEATH OF THE PAST: AT LAST WE HAVE ESCAPED OUR OWN HISTORY. IN SOCIETY, NO LESS THAN IN THE THEBAID, THE LETTERS WE WRITE, AND THOSE WE RECEIVE, TESTIFY TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE IN CHAINS, THAT WE HAVE BROKEN NONE OF THE BONDS, THAT WE ARE MERELY SLAVES AND DESERVE TO BE SO.



A LITTLE PATIENCE AND THE MOMENT WILL COME WHEN NOTHING MORE WILL BE POSSIBLE, WHEN HUMANITY, THROWN BACK ON ITSELF, CANNOT TAKE A SINGLE STEP IN ANY DIRECTION. THOUGH WE MAY MANAGE A GENERAL SENSE OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED SPECTACLE, WE SHOULD LIKE DETAILS. … AND WE ARE AFRAID WE WILL MISS THE FESTIVITIES, NOT BEING YOUNG ENOUGH TO HAVE THE LUCK TO ATTEND.



WHETHER IT IS SPOKEN BY A GROCER OR A PHILOSOPHER, THE WORD BEING, APPARENTLY SO RICH, SO TEMPTING, SO CHARGED WITH SIGNIFICANCE, IN FACT MEANS NOTHING AT ALL; INCREDIBLE THAT A MAN IN HIS RIGHT MIND CAN USE IT ON ANY OCCASION WHATEVER.



GETTING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, I WALKED AROUND MY ROOM WITH THE CERTAINTY OF BEING CHOSEN AND CRIMINAL, A DOUBLE PRIVILEGE NATURAL TO THE SLEEPLESS, REVOLTING OR INCOMPREHENSIBLE FOR THE CAPTIVES OF DAYTIME LOGIC.



IT IS NOT GIVEN TO EVERYONE TO HAVE HAD AN UNHAPPY CHILDHOOD. MINE WAS MUCH MORE THAN HAPPY—IT WAS CROWNED. I CANNOT FIND A BETTER ADJECTIVE TO DESIGNATE WHAT WAS TRIUMPHANT ABOUT EVEN ITS PANGS. THAT HAD TO BE PAID FOR, THAT COULD NOT GO UNPUNISHED.



IF I AM SO FOND OF DOSTOEVSKY’S CORRESPONDENCE, IT IS BECAUSE HE SPEAKS IN IT OF NOTHING BUT SICKNESS AND MONEY, THE ONLY “BURNING” SUBJECTS. ALL THE REST IS MERELY FLOURISHES AND CHAFF.



IN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS, IT APPEARS THAT ENGLAND WILL BE ENTIRELY SUBMERGED. IF I WERE AN ENGLISHMAN I SHOULD LAY DOWN MY ARMS AT ONCE.

EACH OF US HAS HIS UNIT OF TIME. FOR ONE IT IS THE DAY, THE WEEK, THE MONTH, OR THE YEAR; FOR ANOTHER, IT IS A DECADE, OR A CENTURY…. THESE UNITS, STILL ON THE HUMAN SCALE, ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY PLAN, ANY TASK.

THERE ARE SOME, HOWEVER, WHO TAKE TIME ITSELF FOR THEIR UNIT, AND SOMETIMES RAISE THEMSELVES ABOVE IT: FOR THEM, WHAT TASK, WHAT PLAN DESERVES TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY? A MAN WHO SEES TOO FAR, WHO IS CONTEMPORARY WITH THE WHOLE FUTURE, CAN NO LONGER ACT OR EVEN MOVE….



AN OBSESSION WITH THE PRECARIOUS ACCOMPANIES ME IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE: MAILING A LETTER THIS MORNING, I TOLD MYSELF IT WAS ADDRESSED TO A MORTAL.



ONE ABSOLUTE EXPERIENCE, APROPOS OF ANYTHING, AND YOU SEEM, IN YOUR OWN EYES, A SURVIVOR.



I HAVE ALWAYS LIVED WITH THE AWARENESS OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF LIVING. AND WHAT HAS MADE EXISTENCE ENDURABLE TO ME IS MY CURIOSITY AS TO HOWL WOULD GET FROM ONE MINUTE, ONE DAY, ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT.



THE FIRST CONDITION FOR BECOMING A SAINT IS TO LOVE BORES, TO ENDURE VISITS….



TO SHAKE PEOPLE UP, TO WAKE THEM FROM THEIR SLEEP, WHILE KNOWING YOU ARE COMMITTING A CRIME AND THAT IT WOULD TE A THOUSAND TIMES TETTER TO LEAVE THEM ALONE, SINCE WHEN THEY WAKE, TOO, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO OFFER THEM….



PORT-ROYAL. IN THAT GREEN VALE, SO MANY CONFLICTS AND LACERATIONS ON ACCOUNT OF A FEW BAGATELLES! ANY BELIEF, AFTER A CERTAIN TIME, SEEMS GRATUITOUS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE, AS DOES THE COUNTER-BELIEF WHICH HAS DESTROYED IT. ONLY THE STUPEFACTION WHICH BOTH PROVOKE REMAINS.



A POOR WRETCH WHO FEELS TIME, WHO IS ITS VICTIM, ITS MARTYR, WHO EXPERIENCES NOTHING ELSE, WHO IS TIME AT EACH MOMENT, KNOWS WHAT A METAPHYSICIAN OR A POET DIVINES ONLY BY GRACE OF A COLLAPSE OR A MIRACLE.



THOSE INNER RUMBLINGS WHICH COME TO NOTHING, AND BY WHICH WE ARE REDUCED TO THE STATE OF A GROTESQUE VOLCANO.



EACH TIME I AM GRIPPED BY A FIT OF RAGE, I BEGIN BY BEING AGGRIEVED AND DISGUSTED, THEN I TEIL MYSELF: WHAT LUCK, WHAT A WINDFALL! I AM STILL ALIVE, I AM STILL ONE OF THOSE FLESH-AND-BLOOD GHOSTS, …



THERE WAS NO END TO THE TELEGRAM I HAD JUST RECEIVED. ALL MY PRETENTIONS, ALL MY INADEQUACIES WERE IN IT. CERTAIN FAILINGS I MYSELF SCARCELY SUSPECTED WERE REVEALED, WERE PROCLAIMED! WHAT PRESCIENCE, AND WHAT DETAIL! AT THE END OF THE INTERMINABLE INDICTMENT, NO CLUE, NO TRACE THAT PERMITTED ME TO IDENTIFY THE SENDER. WHO COULD IT BE? AND WHY THIS HASTE, THIS UNACCUSTOMED MEANS OF COMMUNICATION? WHO EVER SPOKE HIS MIND WITH SUCH RIGOR IN HIS GRIEVANCE? WHERE DID HE COME FROM, THIS OMNISCIENT JUDGE WHO DARED NOT NAME HIMSELF, THIS COWARD IN POSSESSION OF ALL MY SECRETS, THIS INQUISITOR WHO ALLOWED NO EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES, NOT EVEN THE ONES GRANTED BY THE MOST HARDENED TORTURERS? I TOO MIGHT HAVE MADE A MISSTEP OR TWO, I TOO AM ENTITLED TO SOME INDULGENCE. I CRINGE BEFORE THE INVENTORY OF MY DEFECTS, I CHOKE, I CANNOT BEAR THIS PROCESSION OF TRUTHS…. CURSED TELEGRAM—I TEAR IT UP, AND AWAKEN….



TO HAVE OPINIONS IS INEVITABLE, IS NATURAL; TO HAVE CONVICTIONS IS LESS SO. EACH TIME I MEET SOMEONE WHO HAS CONVICTIONS, I WONDER WHAT INTELLECTUAL VICE, WHAT FLAW HAS CAUSED HIM TO ACQUIRE SUCH A THING. HOWEVER LEGITIMATE THIS QUESTION, MY HABIT OF RAISING IT SPOILS THE PLEASURE OF CONVERSATION FOR ME, GIVES ME A BAD CONSCIENCE, MAKES ME HATEFUL IN MY OWN EYES.



ONCE UPON A TIME WRITING SEEMED IMPORTANT TO ME. OF ALL MY SUPERSTITIONS, THIS ONE SEEMS THE MOST COMPROMISING AND THE MOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE.



I HAVE ABUSED THE WORD DISGUST. BUT WHAT OTHER CAN I USE TO INDICATE A STATE IN WHICH EXASPERATION IS CONTINUALLY CORRECTED BY LASSITUDE, AND LASSITUDE BY EXASPERATION?



ALL EVENING, HAVING TRIED TO DEFINE HIM, WE REVIEWED ALL THE EUPHEMISMS WHICH ALLOW US NOT TO PRONOUNCE, IN HIS REGARD, THE WORD PERFIDY. HE IS NOT PERFIDIOUS, HE IS MERELY TORTUOUS, DIABOLICALLY TORTUOUS, AND AT THE SAME TIME INNOCENT, NAÏVE, EVEN ANGELIC. IMAGINE, IF YOU CAN, A MIXTURE OF ALIOSHA AND SMERDYAKOV.



WHEN YOU NO LONGER BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, YOU STOP PRODUCING OR STRUGGLING, YOU EVEN STOP RAISING QUESTIONS OR ANSWERING THEM, WHEREAS IT IS THE CONTRARY WHICH SHOULD HAVE OCCURRED, SINCE IT IS PRECISELY AT THIS MOMENT THAT, BEING FREE OF ALL BONDS, YOU ARE LIKELY TO GRASP THE TRUTH, DISCERN WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS NOT. BUT ONCE YOUR BELIEF IN YOUR OWN ROLE, OR YOUR OWN LOT, HAS DRIED UP, YOU BECOME INCURIOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE, EVEN THE “TRUTH,” THOUGH YOU ARE CLOSER TO IT THAN EVER BEFORE.



IN PARADISE, I WOULD NOT LAST A “SEASON” OR EVEN A DAY; THEN HOW ACCOUNT FOR MY NOSTALGIA FOR IT? I DON’T ACCOUNT FOR IT, IT HAS INHABITED ME ALWAYS, IT WAS PART OF ME BEFORE I WAS.



ANYONE MAY NOW AND THEN HAVE THE SENSE OF OCCUPYING ONLY A POINT AND A MOMENT; TO HAVE SUCH A SENSE DAY AND NIGHT, HOUR BY HOUR, IS LESS FREQUENT, AND IT IS FROM THIS EXPERIENCE, THIS DATUM, THAT ONE TURNS TOWARD NIRVANA OR SARCASM—OR TOWARD BOTH AT ONCE.



ALTHOUGH I HAVE SWORN NEVER TO SIN AGAINST BLESSED CONCISION, I AM STILL IN COMPLICITY WITH WORDS, AND IF I AM SEDUCED BY SILENCE I DARE NOT ENTER IT, I MERELY PROWL ON ITS PERIPHERIES.



WE SHOULD ESTABLISH A RELIGION’S DEGREE OF TRUTH ACCORDING TO WHAT IT MAKES OF THE DEVIL: THE MORE EMINENT THE RANK IT ACCORDS HIM, THE MORE IT TESTIFIES THAT IT IS CONCERNED WITH REALITY, THAT IT REJECTS DECEIT AND LIES, THAT IT IS SERIOUS, THAT IT SETS MORE STORE BY VERIFICATION THAN BY DISTRACTION OR CONSOLATION.



NOTHING DESERVES TO BE UNDONE, DOUBTLESS BECAUSE NOTHING DESERVED TO BE DONE. HENCE WE BECOME DETACHED FROM EVERYTHING, FROM THE ORIGINAL AS WELL AS FROM THE ULTIMATE, FROM ADVENT AS WELL AS FROM COLLAPSE.



WE KNOW, WE FEEL THAT EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SAID, THAT THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO SAY. BUT WE FEEL LESS THAT THIS TRUTH AFFORDS LANGUAGE A STRANGE, EVEN UNSETTLING STATUS WHICH REDEEMS IT. WORDS ARE ULTIMATELY SAVED BECAUSE THEY HAVE CEASED LIVING.



THE ENORMOUS GOOD AND THE ENORMOUS HARM I HAVE DRAWN FROM MY RUMINATIONS ON THE’CONDITION OF THE DEAD.



THE UNDENIABLE ADVANTAGE OF GROWING OLD IS TO BE ABLE TO OBSERVE AT CLOSE RANGE THE SLOW AND METHODICAL DEGRADATION OF OUR ORGANS; THEY ARE ALL BEGINNING TO GO, SOME OBVIOUSLY, OTHERS DISCREETLY. THEY BECOME DETACHED FROM THE BODY, AS THE BODY BECOMES DETACHED FROM US: IT ESCAPES US, FLEES US, NO LONGER BELONGS TO US. IT IS A TRAITOR WE CANNOT EVEN DENOUNCE, SINCE IT STOPS NOWHERE AND PUTS ITSELF IN NO ONE’S SERVICE.



I NEVER TIRE OF READING ABOUT THE HERMITS, PREFERABLY ABOUT THOSE SAID TO BE “WEARY OF SEEKING GOD.” I AM DAZZLED BY THE FAILURES OF THE DESERT.



IF, SOMEHOW, RIMBAUD HAD BEEN ABLE TO GO ON (AS LIKELY AS IMAGINING THE DAY AFTER THE APOCALYPSE, OR A NIETZSCHE SCRIBBLING AWAY AFTER ECCE HOMO), HE WOULD HAVE ENDED BY REINING IN, CALMING DOWN, BY GLOSSING HIS OWN EXPLOSIONS, EXPLICATING THEM—AND HIMSELF. A SACRILEGE IN EVERY CASE, EXCESS OF CONSCIOUSNESS BEING ONLY A FORM OF PROFANATION.



I HAVE FOLLOWED ONLY ONE IDEA ALL THE WAY—THE IDEA THAT EVERYTHING MAN ACHIEVES NECESSARILY TURNS AGAINST HIM. THE IDEA IS NOT A NEW ONE, BUT I HAVE LIVED IT WITH A POWER OF CONVICTION, A DESPERATION WHICH NO FANATICISM, NO DELIRIUM HAS EVER APPROACHED. THERE IS NO MARTYRDOM, NO DISHONOR I WOULD NOT SUFFER FOR IT, AND I WOULD EXCHANGE IT FOR NO OTHER TRUTH, NO OTHER REVELATION.



TO GO STILL FURTHER THAN BUDDHA, TO RAISE ONESELF ABOVE NIRVANA, TO LEARN TO DO WITHOUT IT …, TO BE STOPPED BY NOTHING, NOT EVEN BY THE NOTION OF DELIVERANCE, REGARDING IT AS A MERE WAY-STATION, AN EMBARRASSMENT, AN ECLIPSE …



MY WEAKNESS FOR DOOMED DYNASTIES, FOR DECAYING EMPIRES, FOR THE MONTEZUMAS OF FOREVER, FOR THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN SIGNS, FOR THE LACERATED AND PURSUED, FOR THE DRUNKARDS OF THE INELUCTABLE, FOR THE JEOPARDIZED, THE DEVOURED, FOR ALL WHO ARE WAITING FOR THEIR EXECUTIONER …



I PASS WITHOUT STOPPING AT THE GRAVE OF THAT CRITIC WHOSE VITRIOLIC REMARKS I HAVE SO OFTEN PONDERED. NOR AT THE GRAVE OF THE POET WHO SPENT HIS LIFE DREAMING OF HIS ULTIMATE DISSOLUTION. OTHER NAMES PURSUE ME, ALIEN NAMES LINKED TO A PITILESS AND PACIFYING WISDOM, TO A VISION CALCULATED TO FREE THE MIND FROM ALL OBSESSIONS, EVEN FUNEREAL ONES. NAGARJUNA, CHANDRAKIRTI, SANTIDEVA—UNPARALLELED SWASHBUCKLERS, DIALECTICIANS BELABORED BY THE OBSESSION OF SALVATION, ACROBATS AND APOSTLES OF VACUITY FOR WHOM, SAGES AMONG THE SAGES, THE UNIVERSE WAS ONLY A WORD….



NO MATTER HOW MANY AUTUMNS I OBSERVE THE SPECTACLE OF THESE LEAVES SO EAGER TO FALL, IT STILL SURPRISES ME EACH TIME—A SURPRISE IN WHICH “A CHILL DOWN THE SPINE” WOULD PREVAIL WERE IT NOT FOR THE LAST-MINUTE EXPLOSION OF A GAIETY WHOSE ORIGIN I CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR.



THERE ARE CERTAIN MOMENTS WHEN, REMOTE AS WE ARE FROM ANY FAITH, WE CAN CONCEIVE OF ONLY GOD AS OUR INTERLOCUTOR. TO ADDRESS OURSELVES ELSEWHERE SEEMS AN IMPOSSIBILITY, A MADNESS. SOLITUDE, IN ITS EXTREME REACHES, REQUIRES A FORM OF CONVERSATION, ALSO EXTREME.



MAN GIVES OFF A SPECIAL ODOR: OF ALL THE ANIMALS, HE ALONE SMELLS OF THE CORPSE.



THE HOURS WOULD NOT PASS; DAWN SEEMED REMOTE, INCONCEIVABLE. ACTUALLY IT WAS NOT DAWN I WAS WAITING FOR BUT OBLIVION OF THOSE REFRACTORY HOURS WHICH REFUSED TO STIR. LUCKY THE MAN CONDEMNED TO DEATH, I TOLD MYSELF, WHO ON THE EVE OF HIS EXECUTION IS AT LEAST SURE OF HAVING ONE GOOD NIGHT!



WILL I BE ABLE TO STAND ANOTHER MINUTE? WILL I COLLAPSE? IF THERE IS ONE INTERESTING SENSATION, IT IS THE ONE WHICH GIVES US THE FORETASTE OF EPILEPSY.



A MAN WHO SURVIVES HIMSELF DESPISES HIMSELF WITHOUT ACKNOWLEDGING AS MUCH, SOMETIMES WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING AS MUCH.



WHEN YOU LIVE PAST THE AGE OF REBELLION, AND YOU STILL REBEL, YOU SEEM TO YOURSELF A KIND OF SENILE LUCIFER.



IF WE DID NOT TEAR THE STIGMATA OF LIFE, HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO STEAL AWAY, AND HOW WELL EVERYTHING WOULD GO BY ITSELF!



BETTER THAN ANYONE I AM ABLE TO FORGIVE ON THE SPOT. MY DESIRE FOR REVENGE COMES LATE, TOO LATE, WHEN MEMORY OF THE OFFENSE IS FADING AND WHEN, THE INCITATION TO ACTION HAVING BECOME VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT, I HAVE ONLY ONE RECOURSE: TO DEPLORE MY “GOOD FEELINGS.”



ONLY TO THE DEGREE THAT OUR MOMENTS AFFORD US SOME CONTACT WITH DEATH DO WE HAVE SOME CHANCE TO GLIMPSE ON WHAT INSANITY ALL EXISTENCE IS BASED.



ULTIMATELY, IT IS ENTIRELY A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE WHETHER WE ARE SOMETHING, EVEN IF WE ARE GOD. ON THIS, WITH A LITTLE PRESSURE, ALMOST EVERYONE MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO AGREE. BUT HOW DOES IT HAPPEN THEN THAT EVERYONE ASPIRES TO FURTHER LIFE, TO ADDITIONAL BEING, AND THAT THERE IS NO ONE WHO STRIVES TO SINK, TO DESCEND TOWARD THE IDEAL DEFAULT?



ACCORDING TO A BELIEF RATHER WIDESPREAD AMONG CERTAIN TRIBES, THE DEAD SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE AS THE LIVING, EXCEPT THAT FOR THEM WORDS HAVE A MEANING CONTRARY TO THE ONE THEY HAD: LARGE MEANS SMALL, NEAR FAR, BLACK WHITE….

DOES DYING COME DOWN TO THAT? STILL, BETTER THAN ANY FUNEREAL INVENTION, THIS COMPLETE REVERSAL OF LANGUAGE INDICATES WHAT IS UNWONTED, DUMBFOUNDING ABOUT DEATH….



I AM PERFECTLY WILLING TO BELIEVE IN MAN’S FUTURE, BUT HOW IS ONE TO MANAGE IT WHEN STILL, AFTER ALL, IN POSSESSION OF ONE’S FACULTIES? IT WOULD TAKE THEIR VIRTUALLY COMPLETE COLLAPSE, AND EVEN THEN …!



A THOUGHT WHICH IS NOT SECRETLY STAMPED BY FATALITY IS INTERCHANGEABLE, WORTHLESS, IS MERELY THOUGHT….



IN TURIN, AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS MADNESS, NIETZSCHE WOULD RUSH TO HIS MIRROR, LOOK AT HIMSELF, TURN AWAY, LOOK AGAIN. IN THE TRAIN THAT WAS TAKING HIM TO BASEL, THE ONE THING HE ALWAYS ASKED FOR WAS A MIRROR. HE NO LONGER KNEW WHO HE WAS, KEPT LOOKING FOR HIMSELF, AND THIS MAN, SO EAGER TO PROTECT HIS IDENTITY, SO THIRSTY FOR HIMSELF, HAD NO INSTRUMENT AT HAND BUT THE CLUMSIEST, THE MOST LAMENTABLE OF EXPEDIENTS.



NO ONE MORE USELESS, AND MORE UNUSABLE, THAN I: A DATUM I MUST QUITE SIMPLY ACCEPT, WITHOUT TAKING ANY PRIDE IN THE FACT WHATEVER. SO LONG AS THIS IS NOT THE CASE, THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MY USCLESSNESS WILL SERVE FOR NOTHING.



WHATEVER THE NIGHTMARE, ONE TAKES A ROLE IN IT, ONE IS THE PROTAGONIST, ONE IS SOMETHING. IT IS AT NIGHT THAT THE DISINHERITED MAN TRIUMPHS. IF WE WERE TO SUPPRESS BAD DREAMS, THERE WOULD BE MASS REVOLUTIONS.



TERROR OF THE FUTURE IS ALWAYS GRAFTED ONTO THE DESIRE TO EXPERIENCE THAT TERROR.



SUDDENLY I WAS ALONE WITH … I FELT, THAT AFTERNOON OF MY CHILDHOOD, THAT A VERY SERIOUS EVENT HAD JUST OCCURRED. IT WAS MY FIRST AWAKENING, THE FIRST INDICATION, THE PREMONITORY SIGN OF CONSCIOUSNESS. BEFORE THAT I HAD BEEN ONLY A BEING. FROM THAT MOMENT, I WAS MORE AND LESS THAN THAT. EACH BEGINS WITH A RIFT AND A REVELATION.



BIRTH AND CHAIN ARE SYNONYMS. TO SEE THE LIGHT OF DAY, TO SEE SHACKLES …



TO SAY “EVERYTHING IS ILLUSORY” IS TO COURT ILLUSION, TO ACCORD IT A HIGH DEGREE OF REALITY, THE HIGHEST IN FACT, WHEREAS ON THE CONTRARY ONE WANTED TO DISCREDIT IT. THE SOLUTION? TO STOP PROCLAIMING OR DENOUNCING IT, SERVING IT BY THINKING ABOUT IT. THE VERY IDEA THAT DISQUALIFIES ALL IDEAS IS A FETTER.



IF WE COULD SLEEP TWENTY-FOUR HOURS A DAY, WE WOULD SOON RETURN TO THE PRIMORDIAL SLIME, THE BEATITUDE OF THAT PERFECT TORPOR BEFORE GENESIS—THE DREAM OF EVERY CONSCIOUSNESS SICK OF ITSELF.



NOT TO BE BORN IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST PLAN OF ALL. UNFORTUNATELY IT IS WITHIN NO ONE’S REACH.



NO ONE HAS LOVED THIS WORLD MORE THAN I, AND YET IF IT HAD BEEN OFFERED TO ME, EVEN AS A CHILD, ON A PLATTER, I SHOULD HAVE SHRIEKED, “TOO LATE, TOO LATE!”



“WHAT’S WRONG—WHAT’S THE MATTER WITH YOU?” NOTHING, NOTHING’S THE MATTER, I’VE MERELY TAKEN A LEAP OUTSIDE MY FATE, AND NOW I DON’T KNOW WHERE TO TURN, WHAT TO RUN FOR….

BETWEEN THE GAPS, I WAS SWIMMING LAPS
GOT CLOSE TO SOME EPIPHANY
I'LL CONVINCE A FRIEND TO JOIN DEEP ENDS
HAVE YOUR TOES TOUCH THE LACK OF CEMENT?
GATHER TO ONE CORNER OF THE WOODS
ECHO CHAMBERS INSIDE A NEIGHBORHOOD
AND CENTERFOLD, HUMILITY SHOWN
YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT YOUR MAMA'S SEWN
AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT YOU RESIDE
IN A HELL AND IN DISGUISE?
NOBODY YET EVERYTHING
A POOL TO SHED YOUR MEMORY
COULD YOU SAY YOU EVEN TRIED?
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED YOUR FAMILY TWICE
I CAN HOPE TONIGHT GOES DIFFERENTLY
BUT I SHOW UP TO THE PARTY JUST TO LEAVE
BETWEEN THE GAPS, KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS
HOW I GOT TO SOME EPIPHANY
I'LL CONVINCE MYSELF WHEN IT TURNS TO TWELVE
THE PHOTOS KEEP THE SENTIMENT
GATHER TO ONE CORNER OF THE WOODS
ECHO CHAMBERS INSIDE A NEIGHBORHOOD
AND CENTERFOLD, HUMILITY SHOWN
YOU'RE NOT AS GOOD AS WHAT YOUR MAMA'S SEWN
AREN'T YOU GLAD THAT YOU RESIDE
IN A HELL AND IN DISGUISE?
NOBODY YET EVERYTHING
A POOL TO SHED YOUR MEMORY
COULD YOU SAY YOU EVEN TRIED?
YOU HAVEN'T CALLED YOUR FAMILY TWICE
I CAN HOPE TONIGHT GOES DIFFERENTLY
BUT I SHOW UP TO THE PARTY JUST TO LEAVE
PULLING BACK, I TRIED TO FIND
THE POINT OF WASTING PRECIOUS TIME
I SIP AND TOAST TO NORMALCY
A FOOL'S WAY INTO JEALOUSY
I MOCK AND IMITATE GOODBYES
WHEN I DIE, I CAN'T DENY
THAT I'LL BE HERE FOREVER WHILE
I'LL SHOW UP TO THE PARTY JUST TO LEAVE

HAS IT BEEN TOO LONG SINCE YOU LAST FELT LOVE FROM A LETTER? I HOPE 
IT HASN’T. FORGIVE ME NONETHELESS, FOR IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY AND I WISH I 
COULD GIVE YOU NOTHING BUT THE BEST AS USUAL. I AM WRITING THIS AROUND 
A MONTH BEFORE THE ACTUAL DATE; THE URGE TO WRITE TO YOU COMES OFTEN AT 
ODD TIMING AND OFTEN IN THE NIGHT. AND THERE IS MUCH TO WRITE.
FIRST OF ALL, THE LAST FIVE MONTHS HAVE MADE ME WISHED WE HAD SPENT 
MORE OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER. WE FOUND OUR WAY TOGETHER IN THE END, 
DIDN’T WE? THE UNIVERSE WORKS IN CURIOUS WAYS, BUT IT IS THE FORTUITIES 
IN LIFE THAT CREATE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF ENDINGS. 
WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAD HAPPENED IN DECEMBER, THE EMOTIONS 
WE FELT, THE WORDS THAT WERE SAID, IT FEELS BUT A DREAM THAT WE MADE IT 
THROUGH. I DO NOT WISH TO HARP ON THAT DREADFUL MONTH IN THE LETTER, 
BUT MY DEAR LOVE, THANK YOU FOR HOLDING ON. I DO FEEL LIKE I AM RUNNING 
OUT OF TIME ON BAD DAYS, AND FALLING BEHIND ON THOSE WHICH ARE WORSE. 
I SO MUCH WANT TO GIVE YOU ALL THAT YOU WANT, ALL THAT YOU DESERVE. THE 
LACK HAUNTS ME. BUT THANK YOU FOR LOVING ME SO PASSIONATELY, IT IS ALL I 
WILL EVER ASK FOR FROM YOU. 
I WILL NOT KNOW WHEN YOU WILL READ THIS, OR WHAT WE WILL DO ON THAT 
DAY. BUT EVERY MOMENT SPENT WITH YOU, I WILL REMEMBER AND TREASURE 
WITH EQUAL LOVE, BUT I HOPE THE TIME WE EVENTUALLY SPEND ON YOUR 
BIRTHDAY WILL COME CLOSE TO THE ONE WE HAD ON NEW YEAR’S DAY. NO 
MATTER HOW DISTANT WE MAY SEEM TO BE, WE REMAIN TOGETHER IN ORBIT 
AND CONVERGING EVENTUALLY. AND HOW MAGICAL THAT FEELING IS WHEN WE 
EVENTUALLY DO.
MAY WE CONTINUE TO LOVE AND GROW AS ONE FOR MUCH LONGER. I HOPE 
WE WILL EVENTUALLY LEARN TO BE KIND TO OURSELVES LIKE HOW WE ARE KIND TO 
EACH OTHER.

IT IS RAINING AND THE STREET LAMPS ARE LIT. THE ETERNAL VOICE THAT 
SHOUTS AT THE ARTIST: “CREATE, MAKE.”
WE NEED A SYMBOL TO REMIND US THAT THERE IS MORE TO... 297. ON 
THE LIFE OF THE ARTIST. YES, WE DO. BUT ONLY RARELY ENOUGH. TO START 
GIVING IS TO CONDEMN ONESELF FOR NOT GIVING ENOUGH, EVEN THOUGH 
ONE GIVES EVERYTHING. AND DO WE EVER GIVE EVERYTHING#AND NEVER ENOUGH.
AND NEVER ENOUGH. 4) WE ARE THE LAST TO RENOUNCE OUR CONDITION, 
SINCE WE ARE ITS FIRST VICTIMS. THE POINT IS TO LIVE OR DIE, AND NOT TO 
GROW OLD IN THE SPECTACLE OF THE ABSURD.
YOU SEE, I HAD HOPED FOR THE IMPOSSIBLE. I HAD EVEN CONTEMPLATED 
SUICIDE. I WAS WAITING, BREATHLESS, FOR A SIGN, A BECKONING FROM THE 
ABSURD. AND THEN, SECURITY, THE ONLY ATTENTION, THAT STRANGE FEELING 
OF NOT BELONGING TO THE BODY, THE ONLY THING THAT A HUMAN BEING 
CAN OFFER TO THE ABSURD—IT IS THE ONLY LASTING ATTENTION THAT AN 
ABSURD THOUGHT CAN HAVE.
APRIL 19
DO NOT LOSE HEART. I TELL MYSELF IT WILL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN AND 
THAT I MUST ACCEPT THE FACT THAT CERTAIN DAYS ARE WORSE THAN 
OTHERS. AS I GO DOWN THE RUE DEL GARD IN ORDER TO THROW LIGHT 
ON WHAT HAS BEEN DESTROYED IN THE PAST. A BIG HOUSE SITTING 
ALONE IN THE MIDST OF THE LAUREL. THE HOUSE FILLS ME WITH ITS 
OWN WEIGHT, WITH ITS OWN HEARTBEAT, WITH ITS OWN SINS, AND 
ITS PAST. IN A LAST EFFORT TO FIND THE LOVING MOTHER I NEVER HAD.

DO NOT HIDE THE NEW MADNESS

MAY 1
ONE DAY, YOU RECEIVE A LETTER: “MY DEAR,” THE OTHER SAID. “YOUR 
FATHER IS DEAD” YOU READ: IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN 
THE PAST. IT ALSO SAYS THAT YOU HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS WITH 
ME. AND IT IS TRUE THAT YOU HAVE SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS. BUT IT 
IS NOT ALWAYS SO. SOMETIMES IT’S JUST THE OPPOSITE. SOMETIMES IT IS 
NECESSARY TO BE VERY PRECISE AND VERY KIND IN ORDER TO BE WRONG. 
MY FATHER IS DEAD, AND I’M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY ANYTHING. BUT I 
WANT TO MAKE A SCENE, BELIEVE ME. IT’S NOT RIGHT, MAN, OR WOMAN, 
TO BE TYPING THIS IN A DARK AFTER CALLING A SUICIDE HOTLINE. IT’S TIME 
MY FATHER WENT, OR MY MOTHER TOOK HIS PLACE. THE PIGEONS WENT, 
AND THE SHOPKEEPER QUIT HIS JOB, TOO. SO THERE’S NO WAY TO GET MY 
FATHER BACK, OR ANYONE ELSE’S, FOR THAT MATTER. I’M NOT WRITING TO GET 
LAID, OR EVEN TO PASS THE TIME, OR TO BE REMEMBERED. I NEED PEOPLE, 
OR I’M NOT WRITING. I NEED A POET WITH A NAME, RECOGNITION, AND A 
POEM TO STAND ON. SOONER OR LATER, WE WILL ALL BE DEAD. AND ONE 
CAN ONLY FEEL MY TIME WILL SOON BE OVER.
MAY 3
HOW DO WE KNOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE IN A SUNLESS CEMETERY? 
THIS IS WHAT WE SEE ON ALL THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KILLED. 
THE CROWDS OF MEN AND THE STURDY BUT LIVID FACES OF THE PAST ARE 
WASHED AWAY IN THE PRESENT; THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KILLED 
HAVE TOO OFTEN CEASED TO HAVE A TEXTURE, TO HAVE SIGNIFICANCE. 
HOW DO WE KNOW WE ARE NOT GOING TO LIVE IN A SUNLESS CEMETERY? 
THIS IS WHAT WE SEE ON ALL THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KILLED. 
THE CROWDS OF MEN AND THE STURDY BUT LIVID FACES OF THE PAST ARE 
WASHED AWAY IN THE PRESENT; THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE WE HAVE KILLED 
HAVE TOO OFTEN CEASED TO HAVE A TEXTURE, TO HAVE SIGNIFICANCE.

MAY 15
THE CIVIL WAR WAS OVER
THE COUNTRY WE CALL OUR OWN
FILLED WITH HATRED FOR THE
WORLD, THAT MAKES US TURN IN PAIN
TO THINK OF THAT FAMOUS BREACH
BETWEEN THE WHITE HOUSES AND THE STREET
STRANGE NIGHT, THAT NEVER WAS
TO MEND, UNTIL NOW
SOMETHING IS DYING
AND MIGHTILY INSIST UPON ME
TO TELL WHAT I KNOW.
THE RED-ROSE-TREE STIFFENED
AS NIGHT GENTLY FALLS
AROUND THE GARDEN WALL;

I MUST BE DREAMING. I WANT TO THINK SO. I CAN FEEL MY LIFE EBBING AND FLOWING, 
DYING AND BEING REBORN, BEING RIPPED APART BY THE DISEASE AND BROKEN AND BORN 
AGAIN, AND NOTHING IS EVER REALLY THE SAME. I CANNOT DIE, OR I MUST NEVER DIE, AND 
I KEEP DREAMING AND GOING BACK AND FORTH. WE ARE BORN INTO THE END. WE DIE 
INTO THE BEGINNING. THE MOMENT IS NOW.
“GOODBYE,” I SAY TO IT.
“GO.”
 IF I WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAVE, I WOULD WALK AWAY ON FOOT; TO THOSE 
I LOVE AND TO THOSE I LOVE NOT, I WOULD SPEAK. I WOULD REACH OUT WITH EVERY FIBRE 
OF MY BEING, IF POSSIBLE. AND THEN: SEE IF YOU CAN LEARN TO IMAGINE WHAT IT IS 
LIKE TO BE ME.
I THINK I CAN HEAR THE BREEZE THAT IS OUTSIDE. IT IS COLD. AND STILL. THERE IS NO 
MOVEMENT. THERE IS NO NOISE.
YET WHAT KIND OF DELUDED YOUNG LOVERS ARE WE? WE WERE HAPPY. WE 
HAD NO NEED TO WORRY. AND WHAT’S HAPPENED TO US? THE LOVE AND LOSS IN 
THIS SYMPHONY ARE SO IMMEASURABLE, SO ENORMOUS. THIS IS THE START OF HOW 
IT ALL ENDS. AND HERE I AM, MORE ALONE AND EMPTY THAN BEFORE. IF I LOOK 
PAST THE DROOPING BRANCHES AND THE SHAKING LEAVES, I CAN SEE THE PERFECT, 
TWINKLING STARS. AND EVEN THOUGH I CAN’T MAKE OUT ANY INDIVIDUAL STARS, I 
SEE THAT THEY TWINKLE, CONSTANTLY. I THINK THAT’S WHAT MAKES ME CRY HARDER. 
YOU WON’T LOOK AT ME. YOU WON’T SMILE AT ME. YOU WON’T GREET ME. YOU 
WON’T. YOU WON’T.
MY FRIEND, PLEASE THINK ABOUT ME WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE FACES OF THE PEOPLE 
YOU’LL LOVE. ALL THE LITTLE PEOPLE. AND I’LL BE THERE FOR YOU.

HERE SIT WE, FORMING IMMORTALS. HATH, IN MAKING HIM, MADE OUR 
HOPE FOR LIFE A MISERY. WHAT, MAY I NOT ASK, HAS DRIVEN YOU ON?
MY TRAJECTORY IS COMPLETE, FROM LOGIC TO EPILEPSY. HERE IS THE TIME, 
THEN, WHEN I SHOULD TRY TO BECOME SOMETHING. TO BE A “THING.” I AM MORE 
THAN A WAR BETWEEN MAN AND GOD. WHAT HAS HE GOT TO GIVE US? DO YOU 
NOT KNOW? WE ASK OF GODS MORE THAN THEY CAN GIVE. FOR IT IS USELESS TO 
MAINTAIN THE CONTRARY. BUT WHAT A MISTAKE AND WHAT DESPAIR. AND MYSELF 
PERHAPS... WHAT A MISTAKE. 
YOU SAY I CANNOT CHANGE, BUT YOU FORGET.
YOU FORGET THAT I DO NOT HAVE TO DO THIS.
YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE SHOWN YOU.
YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE LIVED.
YOU FORGET THAT I HAVE BEEN TESTED. AND THAT I HAVE FAILED. 
THE LIGHT CANNOT BE BIRTHED. NO, THE BURDEN CAN NEVER BE LIT. IT IS A 
PATH THAT LEADS TO DEATH. THE PATH IS TO BE FOLLOWED, NOT ONLY BY THOSE WHO 
REFUSE TO FACE IT. THERE IS NOTHING AFTER LIFE, NOTHING AFTER DEATH. NOTHING. 
NOTHING. 
 OUR FANTASIES TAKE US DOWN ROADS IN WHICH WE ARE NO LONGER FREE. BUT 
NOT FOR MUCH LONGER.

WHEN WILL YOU LEAVE?

TWO MORE MINUTES?

NO IT WAS NOT LOVE OR GENEROSITY THAT AWAKENED ME WHEN I WAS IN DANGER OF BEING FORSAKEN, BUT MERELY THE DESIRE TO BE LOVED AND TO RECEIVE WHAT IN MY OPINION WAS DUE TO ME. THE MOMENT I WAS LOVED AND MY PARTNER AGAIN FORGOTTEN, I SHONE, I WAS AT THE TOP OF MY FORM, I BECAME LIKEABLE.

MEN ARE NEVER CONVINVED OF YOUR REASONS, OF YOUR SINCERITY, OF THE SERIOUSNESS OF YOUR SUFFERINGS, EXCEPT BY YOU DEATH. SO AS LONG AS YOU ARE ALIVE, YOUR CASE IS DOUBTFUL; YOU HAVE A RIGHT ONLY TO THEIR SKETICISM.

I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT TOMAS FOR MANY YEARS. BUT ONLY IN THE LIGHT OF THESE REFLECTIONS DID I SEE HIM CLEARLY. I SAW HIM STANDING AT THE WINDOW OF HIS FLAT AND LOOKING ACROSS THE COURTYARD AT THE OPPOSITE WALLS, NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO.

HE HAD FIRST MET TEREZA ABOUT THREE WEEKS EARLIER IN A SMALL CZECH TOWN. THEY HAD SPENT SCARCELY AN HOUR TOGETHER. SHE HAD ACCOMPANIED HIM TO THE STATION AND WAITED WITH HIM UNTIL HE BOARDED THE TRAIN. TEN DAYS LATER SHE PAID HIM A VISIT. THEY MADE LOVE THE DAY SHE ARRIVED. THAT NIGHT SHE CAME DOWN WITH A FEVER AND STAYED A WHOLE WEEK IN HIS FLAT WITH THE FLU.

HE HAD COME TO FEEL AN INEXPLICABLE LOVE FOR THIS ALL BUT COMPLETE STRANGER; SHE SEEMED A CHILD TO HIM, A CHILD SOMEONE HAD PUT IN A BULRUSH BASKET DAUBED WITH PITCH AND SENT DOWNSTREAM FOR TOMAS TO FETCH AT THE RIVERBANK OF HIS BED.

SHE STAYED WITH HIM A WEEK, UNTIL SHE WAS WELL AGAIN, THEN WENT BACK TO HER TOWN, SOME HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE MILES FROM PRAGUE. AND THEN CAME THE TIME I HAVE JUST SPOKEN OF AND SEE AS THE KEY TO HIS LIFE: STANDING BY THE WINDOW, HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE COURTYARD AT THE WALLS OPPOSITE HIM AND DELIBERATED.

SHOULD HE CALL HER BACK TO PRAGUE FOR GOOD? HE FEARED THE RESPONSIBILITY. IF HE INVITED HER TO COME, THEN COME SHE WOULD, AND OFFER HIM UP HER LIFE.


7

OR SHOULD HE REFRAIN FROM APPROACHING HER? THEN SHE WOULD REMAIN A WAITRESS IN A HOTEL RESTAURANT OF A PROVINCIAL TOWN AND HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN.

DID HE WANT HER TO COME OR DID HE NOT?

HE LOOKED OUT OVER THE COURTYARD AT THE OPPOSITE WALLS, SEEKING AN ANSWER.

HE KEPT RECALLING HER LYING ON HIS BED; SHE REMINDED HIM OF NO ONE IN HIS FORMER LIFE. SHE WAS NEITHER MISTRESS NOR WIFE. SHE WAS A CHILD WHOM HE HAD TAKEN FROM A BULRUSH BASKET THAT HAD BEEN DAUBED WITH PITCH AND SENT TO THE RIVERBANK OF HIS BED. SHE FELL ASLEEP. HE KNELT DOWN NEXT TO HER. HER FEVEROUS BREATH QUICKENED AND SHE GAVE OUT A WEAK MOAN. HE PRESSED HIS FACE TO HERS AND WHISPERED CALMING WORDS INTO HER SLEEP. AFTER A WHILE HE FELT HER BREATH RETURN TO NORMAL AND HER FACE RISE UNCONSCIOUSLY TO MEET HIS. HE SMELLED THE DELICATE AROMA OF HER FEVER AND BREATHED IT IN, AS IF TRYING TO GLUT HIMSELF WITH THE INTIMACY OF HER BODY. AND ALL AT ONCE HE FANCIED SHE HAD BEEN WITH HIM FOR MANY YEARS AND WAS DYING. HE HAD A SUDDEN CLEAR FEELING THAT HE WOULD NOT SURVIVE HER DEATH. HE WOULD LIE DOWN BESIDE HER AND WANT TO DIE WITH HER. HE PRESSED HIS FACE INTO THE PILLOW BESIDE HER HEAD AND KEPT IT THERE FOR A LONG TIME.

NOW HE WAS STANDING AT THE WINDOW TRYING TO CALL THAT MOMENT TO ACCOUNT. WHAT COULD IT HAVE BEEN IF NOT LOVE DECLARING ITSELF TO HIM?

BUT WAS IT LOVE? THE FEELING OF WANTING TO DIE BESIDE HER WAS CLEARLY EXAGGERATED: HE HAD SEEN HER ONLY ONCE BEFORE IN HIS LIFE! WAS IT SIMPLY THE HYSTERIA OF A MAN WHO, AWARE DEEP DOWN OF HIS INAPTITUDE FOR LOVE, FELT THE SELF-DELUDING NEED TO SIMULATE IT? HIS UNCONSCIOUS WAS SO COWARDLY THAT THE BEST PARTNER IT COULD CHOOSE FOR ITS LITTLE COMEDY WAS THIS MISERABLE PROVINCIAL WAITRESS WITH PRACTICALLY NO CHANCE AT ALL TO ENTER HIS LIFE!

LOOKING OUT OVER THE COURTYARD AT THE DIRTY WALLS, HE REALIZED HE HAD NO IDEA WHETHER IT WAS HYSTERIA OR LOVE.


8

AND HE WAS DISTRESSED THAT IN A SITUATION WHERE A REAL MAN WOULD INSTANTLY HAVE KNOWN HOW TO ACT, HE WAS VACILLATING AND THEREFORE DEPRIVING THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS HE HAD EVER EXPERIENCED (KNEELING AT HER BED AND THINKING HE WOULD NOT SURVIVE HER DEATH) OF THEIR MEANING.

HE REMAINED ANNOYED WITH HIMSELF UNTIL HE REALIZED THAT NOT KNOWING WHAT HE WANTED WAS ACTUALLY QUITE NATURAL.

WE CAN NEVER KNOW WHAT TO WANT, BECAUSE, LIVING ONLY ONE LIFE, WE CAN NEITHER COMPARE IT WITH OUR PREVIOUS LIVES NOR PERFECT IT IN OUR LIVES TO COME.

WAS IT BETTER TO BE WITH TEREZA OR TO REMAIN ALONE?

THERE IS NO MEANS OF TESTING WHICH DECISION IS BETTER, BECAUSE THERE IS NO BASIS FOR COMPARISON. WE LIVE EVERYTHING AS IT COMES, WITHOUT WARNING, LIKE AN ACTOR GOING ON COLD. AND WHAT CAN LIFE BE WORTH IF THE FIRST REHEARSAL FOR LIFE IS LIFE ITSELF? THAT IS WHY LIFE IS ALWAYS LIKE A SKETCH. NO, "SKETCH" IS NOT QUITE THE WORD, BECAUSE A SKETCH IS AN OUTLINE OF SOMETHING, THE GROUNDWORK FOR A PICTURE, WHEREAS THE SKETCH THAT IS OUR LIFE IS A SKETCH FOR NOTHING, AN OUTLINE WITH NO PICTURE.

EINMAL IST KEINMAL, SAYS TOMAS TO HIMSELF. WHAT HAPPENS BUT ONCE, SAYS THE GERMAN ADAGE, MIGHT AS WELL NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT ALL. IF WE HAVE ONLY ONE LIFE TO LIVE, WE MIGHT AS WELL NOT HAVE LIVED AT ALL.

BUT THEN ONE DAY AT THE HOSPITAL, DURING A BREAK BETWEEN OPERATIONS, A NURSE CALLED HIM TO THE TELEPHONE. HE HEARD TEREZA'S VOICE COMING FROM THE RECEIVER. SHE HAD PHONED HIM FROM THE RAILWAY STATION. HE WAS OVERJOYED. UNFORTUNATELY, HE HAD SOMETHING ON THAT EVENING AND COULD NOT INVITE HER TO HIS PLACE UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. THE MOMENT HE HUNG UP, HE REPROACHED HIMSELF FOR NOT TELLING HER TO GO STRAIGHT THERE. HE HAD TIME ENOUGH TO CANCEL HIS PLANS, AFTER ALL! HE TRIED TO IMAGINE WHAT TEREZA WOULD DO IN PRAGUE DURING THE THIRTY-SIX LONG HOURS BEFORE THEY WERE TO MEET, AND HAD HALF A MIND TO JUMP INTO HIS CAR AND DRIVE THROUGH THE STREETS LOOKING FOR HER.

SHE ARRIVED THE NEXT EVENING, A HANDBAG DANGLING FROM HER SHOULDER, LOOKING MORE ELEGANT THAN BEFORE. SHE HAD A THICK BOOK UNDER HER ARM. IT WAS ANNA KARENINA. SHE SEEMED IN A GOOD MOOD, EVEN A LITTLE BOISTEROUS, AND TRIED TO MAKE HIM THINK SHE HAD JUST HAPPENED TO DROP IN, THINGS HAD JUST WORKED OUT THAT WAY: SHE WAS IN PRAGUE ON BUSINESS, PERHAPS (AT THIS POINT SHE BECAME RATHER VAGUE) TO FIND A JOB.

LATER, AS THEY LAY NAKED AND SPENT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE BED, HE ASKED HER WHERE SHE WAS STAYING. IT WAS NIGHT BY THEN, AND HE OFFERED TO DRIVE HER THERE. EMBARRASSED, SHE ANSWERED THAT SHE STILL HAD TO FIND A HOTEL AND HAD LEFT HER SUITCASE AT THE STATION.

ONLY TWO DAYS AGO, HE HAD FEARED THAT IF HE INVITED HER TO PRAGUE SHE WOULD OFFER HIM UP HER LIFE. WHEN SHE TOLD HIM HER SUITCASE WAS AT THE STATION, HE IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT THE SUITCASE CONTAINED HER LIFE AND THAT SHE HAD LEFT IT AT THE STATION ONLY UNTIL SHE COULD OFFER IT UP TO HIM.

THE TWO OF THEM GOT INTO HIS CAR, WHICH WAS PARKED IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE, AND DROVE TO THE STATION. THERE HE CLAIMED THE

9


10


SUITCASE (IT WAS LARGE AND ENORMOUSLY HEAVY) AND TOOK IT AND HER HOME.

HOW HAD HE COME TO MAKE SUCH A SUDDEN DECISION WHEN FOR NEARLY A FORTNIGHT HE HAD WAVERED SO MUCH THAT HE COULD NOT EVEN BRING HIMSELF TO SEND A POSTCARD ASKING HER HOW SHE WAS?

HE HIMSELF WAS SURPRISED. HE HAD ACTED AGAINST HIS PRINCIPLES. TEN YEARS EARLIER, WHEN HE HAD DIVORCED HIS WIFE, HE CELEBRATED THE EVENT THE WAY OTHERS CELEBRATE A MARRIAGE. HE UNDERSTOOD HE WAS NOT BORN TO LIVE SIDE BY SIDE WITH ANY WOMAN AND COULD BE FULLY HIMSELF ONLY AS A BACHELOR. HE TRIED TO DESIGN HIS LIFE IN SUCH A WAY THAT NO WOMAN COULD MOVE IN WITH A SUITCASE. THAT WAS WHY HIS FLAT HAD ONLY THE ONE BED. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS WIDE ENOUGH, TOMAS WOULD TELL HIS MISTRESSES THAT HE WAS UNABLE TO FALL ASLEEP WITH ANYONE NEXT TO HIM, AND DRIVE THEM HOME AFTER MIDNIGHT. AND SO IT WAS NOT THE FLU THAT KEPT HIM FROM SLEEPING WITH TEREZA ON HER FIRST VISIT. THE FIRST NIGHT HE HAD SLEPT IN HIS LARGE ARMCHAIR, AND THE REST OF THAT WEEK HE DROVE EACH NIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL, WHERE HE HAD A COT IN HIS OFFICE.

BUT THIS TIME HE FELL ASLEEP BY HER SIDE. WHEN HE WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING, HE FOUND TEREZA, WHO WAS STILL ASLEEP, HOLDING HIS HAND. COULD THEY HAVE BEEN HAND IN HAND ALL NIGHT? IT WAS HARD TO BELIEVE.

AND WHILE SHE BREATHED THE DEEP BREATH OF SLEEP AND HELD HIS HAND (FIRMLY: HE WAS UNABLE TO DISENGAGE IT FROM HER GRIP), THE ENORMOUSLY HEAVY SUITCASE STOOD BY THE BED.

HE REFRAINED FROM LOOSENING HIS HAND FROM HER GRIP FOR FEAR OF WAKING HER, AND TURNED CAREFULLY ON HIS SIDE TO OBSERVE HER BETTER.

AGAIN IT OCCURRED TO HIM THAT TEREZA WAS A CHILD PUT IN A PITCH-DAUBED BULRUSH BASKET AND SENT DOWNSTREAM. HE COULDN'T VERY WELL LET A BASKET WITH A CHILD IN IT FLOAT DOWN A STORMY RIVER! IF THE PHARAOH'S DAUGHTER HADN'T SNATCHED THE BASKET CARRYING


11

LITTLE MOSES FROM THE WAVES, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO OLD TESTAMENT, NO CIVILIZATION AS WE NOW KNOW IT! HOW MANY ANCIENT MYTHS BEGIN WITH THE RESCUE OF AN ABANDONED CHILD! IF POLYBUS HADN'T TAKEN IN THE YOUNG OEDIPUS, SOPHOCLES WOULDN'T HAVE WRITTEN HIS MOST BEAUTIFUL TRAGEDY!

TOMAS DID NOT REALIZE AT THE TIME THAT METAPHORS ARE DANGEROUS. METAPHORS ARE NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH. A SINGLE METAPHOR CAN GIVE BIRTH TO LOVE.

5
HE LIVED A SCANT TWO YEARS WITH HIS WIFE, AND THEY HAD A SON. AT THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS, THE JUDGE AWARDED THE INFANT TO ITS MOTHER AND ORDERED TOMAS TO PAY A THIRD OF HIS SALARY FOR ITS SUPPORT. HE ALSO GRANTED HIM THE RIGHT TO VISIT THE BOY EVERY OTHER WEEK.

BUT EACH TIME TOMAS WAS SUPPOSED TO SEE HIM, THE BOY'S MOTHER FOUND AN EXCUSE TO KEEP HIM AWAY. HE SOON REALIZED THAT BRINGING THEM EXPENSIVE GIFTS WOULD MAKE THINGS A GOOD DEAL EASIER, THAT HE WAS EXPECTED TO BRIBE THE MOTHER FOR THE SON'S LOVE. HE SAW A FUTURE OF QUIXOTIC ATTEMPTS TO INCULCATE HIS VIEWS IN THE BOY, VIEWS OPPOSED IN EVERY WAY TO THE MOTHER'S. THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT EXHAUSTED HIM. WHEN, ONE SUNDAY, THE BOY'S MOTHER AGAIN CANCELED A SCHEDULED VISIT, TOMAS DECIDED ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT NEVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

WHY SHOULD HE FEEL MORE FOR THAT CHILD, TO WHOM HE WAS BOUND BY NOTHING BUT A SINGLE IMPROVIDENT NIGHT, THAN FOR ANY OTHER? HE WOULD BE SCRUPULOUS ABOUT PAYING SUPPORT; HE JUST


12                                                       

DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY MAKING HIM FIGHT FOR HIS SON IN THE NAME OF PATERNAL SENTIMENTS!

NEEDLESS TO SAY, HE FOUND NO SYMPATHIZERS. HIS OWN PARENTS CONDEMNED HIM ROUNDLY: IF TOMAS REFUSED TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN HIS SON, THEN THEY, TOMAS'S PARENTS, WOULD NO LONGER TAKE AN INTEREST IN THEIRS. THEY MADE A GREAT SHOW OF MAINTAINING GOOD RELATIONS WITH THEIR DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND TRUMPETED THEIR EXEMPLARY STANCE AND SENSE OF JUSTICE.

THUS IN PRACTICALLY NO TIME HE MANAGED TO RID HIMSELF OF WIFE, SON, MOTHER, AND FATHER. THE ONLY THING THEY BEQUEATHED TO HIM WAS A FEAR OF WOMEN. TOMAS DESIRED BUT FEARED THEM. NEEDING TO CREATE A COMPROMISE BETWEEN FEAR AND DESIRE, HE DEVISED WHAT HE CALLED "EROTIC FRIENDSHIP." HE WOULD TELL HIS MISTRESSES: THE ONLY RELATIONSHIP THAT CAN MAKE BOTH PARTNERS HAPPY IS ONE IN WHICH SENTIMENTALITY HAS NO PLACE AND NEITHER PARTNER MAKES ANY CLAIM ON THE LIFE AND FREEDOM OF THE OTHER.

TO ENSURE THAT EROTIC FRIENDSHIP NEVER GREW INTO THE AGGRESSION OF LOVE, HE WOULD MEET EACH OF HIS LONG-TERM MISTRESSES ONLY AT INTERVALS. HE CONSIDERED THIS METHOD FLAWLESS AND PROPAGATED IT AMONG HIS FRIENDS: "THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO ABIDE BY THE RULE OF THREES. EITHER YOU SEE A WOMAN THREE TIMES IN QUICK SUCCESSION AND THEN NEVER AGAIN, OR YOU MAINTAIN RELATIONS OVER THE YEARS BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE RENDEZVOUS ARE AT LEAST THREE WEEKS APART."

THE RULE OF THREES ENABLED TOMAS TO KEEP INTACT HIS LIAISONS WITH SOME WOMEN WHILE CONTINUING TO ENGAGE IN SHORT-TERM AFFAIRS WITH MANY OTHERS. HE WAS NOT ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD. THE WOMAN WHO UNDERSTOOD HIM BEST WAS SABINA. SHE WAS A PAINTER. "THE REASON I LIKE YOU," SHE WOULD SAY TO HIM, "IS YOU'RE THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF KITSCH. IN THE KINGDOM OF KITSCH YOU WOULD BE A MONSTER."

IT WAS SABINA HE TURNED TO WHEN HE NEEDED TO FIND A JOB FOR TEREZA IN PRAGUE. FOLLOWING THE UNWRITTEN RULES OF EROTIC


I3

FRIENDSHIP, SABINA PROMISED TO DO EVERYTHING IN HER POWER, AND BEFORE LONG SHE HAD IN FACT LOCATED A PLACE FOR TEREZA IN THE DARKROOM OF AN ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY. ALTHOUGH HER NEW JOB DID NOT REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR QUALIFICATIONS, IT RAISED HER STATUS FROM WAITRESS TO MEMBER OF THE PRESS. WHEN SABINA HERSELF INTRODUCED TEREZA TO EVERYONE ON THE WEEKLY, TOMAS KNEW HE HAD NEVER HAD A BETTER FRIEND AS A MISTRESS THAN SABINA.

6
THE UNWRITTEN CONTRACT OF EROTIC FRIENDSHIP STIPULATED THAT TOMAS SHOULD EXCLUDE ALL LOVE FROM HIS LIFE. THE MOMENT HE VIOLATED THAT CLAUSE OF THE CONTRACT, HIS OTHER MISTRESSES WOULD ASSUME INFERIOR STATUS AND BECOME RIPE FOR INSURRECTION.

ACCORDINGLY, HE RENTED A ROOM FOR TEREZA AND HER HEAVY SUITCASE. HE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO WATCH OVER HER, PROTECT HER, ENJOY HER PRESENCE, BUT FELT NO NEED TO CHANGE HIS WAY OF LIFE. HE DID NOT WANT WORD TO GET OUT THAT TEREZA WAS SLEEPING AT HIS PLACE: SPENDING THE NIGHT TOGETHER WAS THE CORPUS DELICTI OF LOVE.

HE NEVER SPENT THE NIGHT WITH THE OTHERS. IT WAS EASY ENOUGH IF HE WAS AT THEIR PLACE: HE COULD LEAVE WHENEVER HE PLEASED. IT WAS WORSE WHEN THEY WERE AT HIS AND HE HAD TO EXPLAIN THAT COME MIDNIGHT HE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE THEM HOME BECAUSE HE WAS AN INSOMNIAC AND FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FALL ASLEEP IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO ANOTHER PERSON. THOUGH IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THE TRUTH, HE NEVER DARED TELL THEM THE WHOLE TRUTH:

AFTER MAKING LOVE HE HAD AN UNCONTROLLABLE CRAVING TO BE BY


14  


HIMSELF; WAKING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AT THE SIDE OF AN ALIEN BODY WAS DISTASTEFUL TO HIM, RISING IN THE MORNING WITH AN INTRUDER REPELLENT; HE HAD NO DESIRE TO BE OVERHEARD BRUSHING HIS TEETH IN THE BATHROOM, NOR WAS HE ENTICED BY THE THOUGHT OF AN INTIMATE BREAKFAST.

THAT IS WHY HE WAS SO SURPRISED TO WAKE UP AND FIND TEREZA SQUEEZING HIS HAND TIGHTLY. LYING THERE LOOKING AT HER, HE COULD NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD HAPPENED. BUT AS HE RAN THROUGH THE PREVIOUS FEW HOURS IN HIS MIND, HE BEGAN TO SENSE AN AURA OF HITHERTO UNKNOWN HAPPINESS EMANATING FROM THEM.

FROM THAT TIME ON THEY BOTH LOOKED FORWARD TO SLEEPING TOGETHER. I MIGHT EVEN SAY THAT THE GOAL OF THEIR LOVEMAKING WAS NOT SO MUCH PLEASURE AS THE SLEEP THAT FOLLOWED IT. SHE ESPECIALLY WAS AFFECTED. WHENEVER SHE STAYED OVERNIGHT IN HER RENTED ROOM (WHICH QUICKLY BECAME ONLY AN ALIBI FOR TOMAS), SHE WAS UNABLE TO FALL ASLEEP; IN HIS ARMS SHE WOULD FALL ASLEEP NO MATTER HOW WROUGHT UP SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN. HE WOULD WHISPER IMPROMPTU FAIRY TALES ABOUT HER, OR GIBBERISH, WORDS HE REPEATED MONOTONOUSLY, WORDS SOOTHING OR COMICAL, WHICH TURNED INTO VAGUE VISIONS LULLING HER THROUGH THE FIRST DREAMS OF THE NIGHT. HE HAD COMPLETE CONTROL OVER HER SLEEP: SHE DOZED OFF AT THE SECOND HE CHOSE.

WHILE THEY SLEPT, SHE HELD HIM AS ON THE FIRST NIGHT, KEEPING A FIRM GRIP ON WRIST, FINGER, OR ANKLE. IF HE WANTED TO MOVE WITHOUT WAKING HER, HE HAD TO RESORT TO ARTIFICE. AFTER FREEING HIS FINGER (WRIST, ANKLE) FROM HER CLUTCHES, A PROCESS WHICH, SINCE SHE GUARDED HIM CAREFULLY EVEN IN HER SLEEP, NEVER FAILED TO ROUSE HER PARTIALLY, HE WOULD CALM HER BY SLIPPING AN OBJECT INTO HER HAND (A ROLLED-UP PAJAMA TOP, A SLIPPER, A BOOK), WHICH SHE THEN GRIPPED AS TIGHTLY AS IF IT WERE A PART OF HIS BODY.

ONCE, WHEN HE HAD JUST LULLED HER TO SLEEP BUT SHE HAD GONE NO FARTHER THAN DREAM'S ANTECHAMBER AND WAS THEREFORE STILL RESPONSIVE TO HIM, HE SAID TO HER, "GOOD-BYE, I'M GOING


15


NOW." "WHERE?" SHE ASKED IN HER SLEEP. "AWAY," HE ANSWERED STERNLY. "THEN I'M GOING WITH YOU," SHE SAID, SITTING UP IN BED. "NO, YOU CAN'T. I'M GOING AWAY FOR GOOD," HE SAID, GOING OUT INTO THE HALL. SHE STOOD UP AND FOLLOWED HIM OUT, SQUINTING. SHE WAS NAKED BENEATH HER SHORT NIGHTDRESS. HER FACE WAS BLANK, EXPRESSIONLESS, BUT SHE MOVED ENERGETICALLY. HE WALKED THROUGH THE HALL OF THE FLAT INTO THE HALL OF THE BUILDING (THE HALL SHARED BY ALL THE OCCUPANTS), CLOSING THE DOOR IN HER FACE. SHE FLUNG IT OPEN AND CONTINUED TO FOLLOW HIM, CONVINCED IN HER SLEEP THAT HE MEANT TO LEAVE HER FOR GOOD AND SHE HAD TO STOP HIM. HE WALKED DOWN THE STAIRS TO THE FIRST LANDING AND WAITED FOR HER THERE. SHE WENT DOWN AFTER HIM, TOOK HIM BY THE HAND, AND LED HIM BACK TO BED.

TOMAS CAME TO THIS CONCLUSION: MAKING LOVE WITH A WOMAN AND SLEEPING WITH A WOMAN ARE TWO SEPARATE PASSIONS, NOT MERELY DIFFERENT BUT OPPOSITE. LOVE DOES NOT MAKE ITSELF FELT IN THE DESIRE FOR COPULATION (A DESIRE THAT EXTENDS TO AN INFINITE NUMBER OF WOMEN) BUT IN THE DESIRE FOR SHARED SLEEP (A DESIRE LIMITED TO ONE WOMAN).

 

7
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SHE STARTED MOANING IN HER SLEEP. TOMAS WOKE HER UP, BUT WHEN SHE SAW HIS FACE SHE SAID, WITH HATRED IN HER VOICE, "GET AWAY FROM ME! GET AWAY FROM ME!" THEN SHE TOLD HIM HER DREAM: THE TWO OF THEM AND SABINA HAD BEEN IN A BIG ROOM TOGETHER. THERE WAS A BED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. IT WAS LIKE A PLATFORM IN THE THEATER. TOMAS ORDERED


16


HER TO STAND IN THE CORNER WHILE HE MADE LOVE TO SABINA. THE SIGHT OF IT CAUSED TEREZA INTOLERABLE SUFFERING. HOPING TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN IN HER HEART BY PAINS OF THE FLESH, SHE JABBED NEEDLES UNDER HER FINGERNAILS. "IT HURT SO MUCH," SHE SAID, SQUEEZING HER HANDS INTO FISTS AS IF THEY ACTUALLY WERE WOUNDED.

HE PRESSED HER TO HIM, AND SHE GRADUALLY (TREMBLING VIOLENTLY FOR A LONG TIME) FELL ASLEEP IN HIS ARMS.

THINKING ABOUT THE DREAM THE NEXT DAY, HE REMEMBERED SOMETHING. HE OPENED A DESK DRAWER AND TOOK OUT A PACKET OF LETTERS SABINA HAD WRITTEN TO HIM. HE WAS NOT LONG IN FINDING THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE: "I WANT TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU IN MY STUDIO. IT WILL BE LIKE A STAGE SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE. THE AUDIENCE WON'T BE ALLOWED UP CLOSE, BUT THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO TAKE THEIR EYES OFF US...."

THE WORST OF IT WAS THAT THE LETTER WAS DATED. IT WAS QUITE RECENT, WRITTEN LONG AFTER TEREZA HAD MOVED IN WITH TOMAS.

"SO YOU'VE BEEN RUMMAGING IN MY LETTERS!"

SHE DID NOT DENY IT. "THROW ME OUT, THEN!"

BUT HE DID NOT THROW HER OUT. HE COULD PICTURE HER PRESSED AGAINST THE WALL OF SABINA'S STUDIO JABBING NEEDLES UP UNDER HER NAILS. HE TOOK HER FINGERS BETWEEN HIS HANDS AND STROKED THEM, BROUGHT THEM TO HIS LIPS AND KISSED THEM, AS IF THEY STILL HAD DROPS OF BLOOD ON THEM.

BUT FROM THAT TIME ON, EVERYTHING SEEMED TO CONSPIRE AGAINST HIM. NOT A DAY WENT BY WITHOUT HER LEARNING SOMETHING ABOUT HIS SECRET LIFE.

AT FIRST HE DENIED IT ALL. THEN, WHEN THE EVIDENCE BECAME TOO BLATANT, HE ARGUED THAT HIS POLYGAMOUS WAY OF LIFE DID NOT IN THE LEAST RUN COUNTER TO HIS LOVE FOR HER. HE WAS INCONSISTENT: FIRST HE DISAVOWED HIS INFIDELITIES, THEN HE TRIED TO JUSTIFY THEM.

ONCE HE WAS SAYING GOOD-BYE AFTER MAKING A DATE WITH A WOMAN ON THE PHONE, WHEN FROM THE NEXT ROOM CAME A STRANGE SOUND LIKE THE CHATTERING OF TEETH.


17

BY CHANCE SHE HAD COME HOME WITHOUT HIS REALIZING IT. SHE WAS POURING SOMETHING FROM A MEDICINE BOTTLE DOWN HER THROAT, AND HER HAND SHOOK SO BADLY THE GLASS BOTTLE CLICKED AGAINST HER TEETH.

HE POUNCED ON HER AS IF TRYING TO SAVE HER FROM DROWNING. THE BOTTLE FELL TO THE FLOOR, SPOTTING THE CARPET WITH VALERIAN DROPS. SHE PUT UP A GOOD FIGHT, AND HE HAD TO KEEP HER IN A STRAITJACKET-LIKE HOLD FOR A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE HE COULD CALM HER.

HE KNEW HE WAS IN AN UNJUSTIFIABLE SITUATION, BASED AS IT WAS ON COMPLETE INEQUALITY.

ONE EVENING, BEFORE SHE DISCOVERED HIS CORRESPONDENCE WITH SABINA, THEY HAD GONE TO A BAR WITH SOME FRIENDS TO CELEBRATE TEREZA'S NEW JOB. SHE HAD BEEN PROMOTED AT THE WEEKLY FROM DARKROOM TECHNICIAN TO STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER. BECAUSE HE HAD NEVER BEEN MUCH FOR DANCING, ONE OF HIS YOUNGER COLLEAGUES TOOK OVER. THEY MADE A SPLENDID COUPLE ON THE DANCE FLOOR, AND TOMAS FOUND HER MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN EVER. HE LOOKED ON IN AMAZEMENT AT THE SPLIT-SECOND PRECISION AND DEFERENCE WITH WHICH TEREZA ANTICIPATED HER PARTNER'S WILL. THE DANCE SEEMED TO HIM A DECLARATION THAT HER DEVOTION, HER ARDENT DESIRE TO SATISFY HIS EVERY WHIM, WAS NOT NECESSARILY BOUND TO HIS PERSON, THAT IF SHE HADN'T MET TOMAS, SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN READY TO RESPOND TO THE CALL OF ANY OTHER MAN SHE MIGHT HAVE MET INSTEAD. HE HAD NO DIFFICULTY IMAGINING TEREZA AND HIS YOUNG COLLEAGUE AS LOVERS. AND THE EASE WITH WHICH HE ARRIVED AT THIS FICTION WOUNDED HIM. HE REALIZED THAT TEREZA'S BODY WAS PERFECTLY THINKABLE COUPLED WITH ANY MALE BODY, AND THE THOUGHT PUT HIM IN A FOUL MOOD. NOT UNTIL LATE THAT NIGHT, AT HOME, DID HE ADMIT TO HER HE WAS JEALOUS.

THIS ABSURD JEALOUSY, GROUNDED AS IT WAS IN MERE HYPOTHESES, PROVED THAT HE CONSIDERED HER FIDELITY AN UNCONDITIONAL POSTULATE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIP. HOW THEN COULD HE BEGRUDGE HER HER JEALOUSY OF HIS VERY REAL MISTRESSES?


8
DURING THE DAY, SHE TRIED (THOUGH WITH ONLY PARTIAL SUCCESS) TO BELIEVE WHAT TOMAS TOLD HER AND TO BE AS CHEERFUL AS SHE HAD BEEN BEFORE. BUT HER JEALOUSY THUS TAMED BY DAY BURST FORTH ALL THE MORE SAVAGELY IN HER DREAMS, EACH OF WHICH ENDED IN A WAIL HE COULD SILENCE ONLY BY WAKING HER.

HER DREAMS RECURRED LIKE THEMES AND VARIATIONS OR TELEVISION SERIES. FOR EXAMPLE, SHE REPEATEDLY DREAMED OF CATS JUMPING AT HER FACE AND DIGGING THEIR CLAWS INTO HER SKIN. WE NEED NOT LOOK FAR FOR AN INTERPRETATION: IN CZECH SLANG THE WORD "CAT" MEANS A PRETTY WOMAN. TEREZA SAW HERSELF THREATENED BY WOMEN, ALL WOMEN. ALL WOMEN WERE POTENTIAL MISTRESSES FOR TOMAS, AND SHE FEARED THEM ALL.

IN ANOTHER CYCLE SHE WAS BEING SENT TO HER DEATH. ONCE, WHEN HE WOKE HER AS SHE SCREAMED IN TERROR IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT, SHE TOLD HIM ABOUT IT. "I WAS AT A LARGE INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY OF US. ALL WOMEN. WE WERE NAKED AND HAD TO MARCH AROUND THE POOL. THERE WAS A BASKET HANGING FROM THE CEILING AND A MAN STANDING IN THE BASKET. THE MAN WORE A BROAD-BRIMMED HAT SHADING HIS FACE, BUT I COULD SEE IT WAS YOU. YOU KEPT GIVING US ORDERS. SHOUTING AT US. WE HAD TO SING AS WE MARCHED, SING AND DO KNEEBENDS. IF ONE OF US DID A BAD KNEEBEND, YOU WOULD SHOOT HER WITH A PISTOL AND SHE WOULD FALL DEAD INTO THE POOL. WHICH MADE EVERYBODY LAUGH AND SING EVEN LOUDER. YOU NEVER TOOK YOUR EYES OFF US, AND THE MINUTE WE DID SOMETHING WRONG, YOU WOULD SHOOT. THE POOL WAS FULL OF CORPSES FLOATING JUST BELOW THE SURFACE. AND I KNEW I LACKED THE STRENGTH TO DO THE NEXT KNEEBEND AND YOU WERE GOING TO SHOOT ME!"

IN A THIRD CYCLE SHE WAS DEAD.

BYING IN A HEARSE AS BIG AS A FURNITURE VAN, SHE WAS SUR-

18


19

ROUNDED BY DEAD WOMEN. THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM THAT THE BACK DOOR WOULD NOT CLOSE AND SEVERAL LEGS DANGLED OUT.

"BUT I'M NOT DEAD!" TEREZA CRIED. "I CAN STILL FEEL!"

"SO CAN WE," THE CORPSES LAUGHED.

THEY LAUGHED THE SAME LAUGH AS THE LIVE WOMEN WHO USED TO TELL HER CHEERFULLY IT WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL THAT ONE DAY SHE WOULD HAVE BAD TEETH, FAULTY OVARIES, AND WRINKLES, BECAUSE THEY ALL HAD BAD TEETH, FAULTY OVARIES, AND WRINKLES. LAUGHING THE SAME LAUGH, THEY TOLD HER THAT SHE WAS DEAD AND IT WAS PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT!

SUDDENLY SHE FELT A NEED TO URINATE. "YOU SEE," SHE CRIED. "I NEED TO PEE. THAT'S PROOF POSITIVE I'M NOT DEAD!"

BUT THEY ONLY LAUGHED AGAIN. "NEEDING TO PEE IS PERFECTLY NORMAL!" THEY SAID. "YOU'LL GO ON FEELING THAT KIND OF THING FOR A LONG TIME YET. LIKE A PERSON WHO HAS AN ARM CUT OFF AND KEEPS FEELING IT'S THERE. WE MAY NOT HAVE A DROP OF PEE LEFT IN US, BUT WE KEEP NEEDING TO PEE."

TEREZA HUDDLED AGAINST TOMAS IN BED. "AND THE WAY THEY TALKED TO ME! LIKE OLD FRIENDS, PEOPLE WHO'D KNOWN ME FOREVER. I WAS APPALLED AT THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO STAY WITH THEM FOREVER."

ALL LANGUAGES THAT DERIVE FROM LATIN FORM THE WORD "COMPASSION" BY COMBINING THE PREFIX MEANING "WITH" (CORN-) AND THE ROOT MEANING "SUFFERING" (LATE LATIN, PASSIO). IN OTHER LANGUAGES—CZECH, POLISH, GERMAN, AND SWEDISH, FOR INSTANCE— THIS WORD IS TRANSLATED BY A NOUN FORMED OF AN EQUIVALENT PREFIX


20


COMBINED WITH THE WORD THAT MEANS "FEELING" (CZECH, SOU-CIT; POLISH, WSPOL-CZUCIE; GERMAN, MIT-GEFUHL; SWEDISH, MED-KANSIA).

IN LANGUAGES THAT DERIVE FROM LATIN, "COMPASSION" MEANS: WE CANNOT LOOK ON COOLLY AS OTHERS SUFFER; OR, WE SYMPATHIZE WITH THOSE WHO SUFFER. ANOTHER WORD WITH APPROXIMATELY THE SAME MEANING, "PITY" (FRENCH, PITIE; ITALIAN, PIETA; ETC.), CONNOTES A CERTAIN CONDESCENSION TOWARDS THE SUFFERER. "TO TAKE PITY ON A WOMAN" MEANS THAT WE ARE BETTER OFF THAN SHE, THAT WE STOOP TO HER LEVEL, LOWER OURSELVES.

THAT IS WHY THE WORD "COMPASSION" GENERALLY INSPIRES SUSPICION; IT DESIGNATES WHAT IS CONSIDERED AN INFERIOR, SECOND-RATE SENTIMENT THAT HAS LITTLE TO DO WITH LOVE. TO LOVE SOMEONE OUT OF COMPASSION MEANS NOT REALLY TO LOVE.

IN LANGUAGES THAT FORM THE WORD "COMPASSION" NOT FROM THE ROOT "SUFFERING" BUT FROM THE ROOT "FEELING," THE WORD IS USED IN APPROXIMATELY THE SAME WAY, BUT TO CONTEND THAT IT DESIGNATES A BAD OR INFERIOR SENTIMENT IS DIFFICULT. THE SECRET STRENGTH OF ITS ETYMOLOGY FLOODS THE WORD WITH ANOTHER LIGHT AND GIVES IT A BROADER MEANING: TO HAVE COMPASSION (CO-FEELING) MEANS NOT ONLY TO BE ABLE TO LIVE WITH THE OTHER'S MISFORTUNE BUT ALSO TO FEEL WITH HIM ANY EMOTION—JOY, ANXIETY, HAPPINESS, PAIN. THIS KIND OF COMPASSION (IN THE SENSE OF SOUC/R, WSPOFCZUCIE, MITGEFUHL, MEDKANSIA) THEREFORE SIGNIFIES THE MAXIMAL CAPACITY OF AFFECTIVE IMAGINATION, THE ART OF EMOTIONAL TELEPATHY. IN THE HIERARCHY OF SENTIMENTS, THEN, IT IS SUPREME.

BY REVEALING TO TOMAS HER DREAM ABOUT JABBING NEEDLES UNDER HER FINGERNAILS, TEREZA UNWITTINGLY REVEALED THAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH HIS DESK. IF TEREZA HAD BEEN ANY OTHER WOMAN, TOMAS WOULD NEVER HAVE SPOKEN TO HER AGAIN. AWARE OF THAT, TEREZA SAID TO HIM, "THROW ME OUT!" BUT INSTEAD OF THROWING HER OUT, HE SEIZED HER HAND AND KISSED THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS, BECAUSE AT THAT MOMENT HE HIMSELF FELT THE PAIN UNDER HER


21

FINGERNAILS AS SURELY AS IF THE NERVES OF HER FINGERS LED STRAIGHT TO HIS OWN BRAIN.

ANYONE WHO HAS FAILED TO BENEFIT FROM THE DEVIL'S GIFT OF COMPASSION (CO-FEELING) WILL CONDEMN TEREZA COLDLY FOR HER DEED, BECAUSE PRIVACY IS SACRED AND DRAWERS CONTAINING INTIMATE CORRESPONDENCE ARE NOT TO BE OPENED. BUT BECAUSE COMPASSION WAS TOMAS'S FATE (OR CURSE), HE FELT THAT HE HIMSELF HAD KNELT BEFORE THE OPEN DESK DRAWER, UNABLE TO TEAR HIS EYES FROM SABINA'S LETTER. HE UNDERSTOOD TEREZA, AND NOT ONLY WAS HE INCAPABLE OF BEING ANGRY WITH HER, HE LOVED HER ALL THE MORE.

10
HER GESTURES GREW ABRUPT AND UNSTEADY. TWO YEARS HAD ELAPSED SINCE SHE DISCOVERED HE WAS UNFAITHFUL, AND THINGS HAD GROWN WORSE. THERE WAS NO WAY OUT.

WAS HE GENUINELY INCAPABLE OF ABANDONING HIS EROTIC FRIENDSHIPS? HE WAS. IT WOULD HAVE TORN HIM APART. HE LACKED THE STRENGTH TO CONTROL HIS TASTE FOR OTHER WOMEN. BESIDES, HE FAILED TO SEE THE NEED. NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN HE HOW LITTLE HIS EXPLOITS THREATENED TEREZA. WHY THEN GIVE THEM UP? HE SAW NO MORE REASON FOR THAT THAN TO DENY HIMSELF SOCCER MATCHES.

BUT WAS IT STILL A MATTER OF PLEASURE? EVEN AS HE SET OUT TO VISIT ANOTHER WOMAN, HE FOUND HER DISTASTEFUL AND PROMISED HIMSELF HE WOULD NOT SEE HER AGAIN. HE CONSTANTLY HAD TEREZA'S IMAGE BEFORE HIS EYES, AND THE ONLY WAY HE COULD ERASE IT WAS BY QUICKLY GETTING DRUNK. EVER SINCE MEETING TEREZA, HE HAD BEEN UNABLE TO MAKE LOVE TO OTHER WOMEN WITHOUT ALCOHOL! BUT


22


ALCOHOL ON HIS BREATH WAS A SURE SIGN TO TEREZA OF INFIDELITY.

HE WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP: EVEN ON HIS WAY TO SEE THEM, HE FOUND THEM DISTASTEFUL, BUT ONE DAY WITHOUT THEM AND HE WAS BACK ON THE PHONE, EAGER TO MAKE CONTACT.

HE STILL FELT MOST COMFORTABLE WITH SABINA. HE KNEW SHE WAS DISCREET AND WOULD NOT DIVULGE THEIR RENDEZVOUS. HER STUDIO GREETED HIM LIKE A MEMENTO OF HIS PAST, HIS IDYLLIC BACHELOR PAST.

PERHAPS HE HIMSELF DID NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH HE HAD CHANGED: HE WAS NOW AFRAID TO COME HOME LATE, BECAUSE TEREZA WOULD BE WAITING UP FOR HIM. THEN ONE DAY SABINA CAUGHT HIM GLANCING AT HIS WATCH DURING INTERCOURSE AND TRYING TO HASTEN ITS CONCLUSION.

AFTERWARDS, STILL NAKED AND LAZILY WALKING ACROSS THE STUDIO, SHE STOPPED BEFORE AN EASEL WITH A HALF-FINISHED PAINTING AND WATCHED HIM SIDELONG AS HE THREW ON HIS CLOTHES.

WHEN HE WAS FULLY DRESSED EXCEPT FOR ONE BARE FOOT, HE LOOKED AROUND THE ROOM, AND THEN GOT DOWN ON ALL FOURS TO CONTINUE THE SEARCH UNDER A TABLE.

"YOU SEEM TO BE TURNING INTO THE THEME OF ALL MY PAINTINGS," SHE SAID. "THE MEETING OF TWO WORLDS. A DOUBLE EXPOSURE. SHOWING THROUGH THE OUTLINE OF TOMAS THE LIBERTINE, INCREDIBLY, THE FACE OF A ROMANTIC LOVER. OR, THE OTHER WAY, THROUGH A TRISTAN, ALWAYS THINKING OF HIS TEREZA, I SEE THE BEAUTIFUL, BETRAYED WORLD OF THE LIBERTINE."

TOMAS STRAIGHTENED UP AND, DISTRACTEDLY, LISTENED TO SABINA'S WORDS.

"WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?" SHE ASKED.

"A SOCK."

SHE SEARCHED ALL OVER THE ROOM WITH HIM, AND AGAIN HE GOT DOWN ON ALL FOURS TO LOOK UNDER THE TABLE.

"YOUR SOCK ISN'T ANYWHERE TO BE SEEN," SAID SABINA. "YOU MUST HAVE COME WITHOUT IT."


23

"HOW COULD I HAVE COME WITHOUT IT?" CRIED TOMAS, LOOKING AT HIS WATCH. "I WASN'T WEARING ONLY ONE SOCK WHEN I CAME,

TL›?

WAS I?

"IT'S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. YOU'VE BEEN VERY ABSENT-MINDED LATELY. ALWAYS RUSHING SOMEWHERE, LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH. IT WOULDN'T SURPRISE ME IN THE LEAST IF YOU FORGOT TO PUT ON A SOCK."

HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PUT HIS SHOE ON HIS BARE FOOT. "IT'S COLD OUT," SABINA SAID. "I'LL LEND YOU ONE OF MY STOCKINGS."

SHE HANDED HIM A LONG, WHITE, FASHIONABLE, WIDE-NET STOCKING.

HE KNEW VERY WELL SHE WAS GETTING BACK AT HIM FOR GLANCING AT HIS WATCH WHILE MAKING LOVE TO HER. SHE HAD HIDDEN HIS SOCK SOMEWHERE. IT WAS INDEED COLD OUT, AND HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO TAKE HER UP ON THE OFFER. HE WENT HOME WEARING A SOCK ON ONE FOOT AND A WIDE-NET STOCKING ROLLED DOWN OVER HIS ANKLE ON THE OTHER.

HE WAS IN A BIND: IN HIS MISTRESSES' EYES, HE BORE THE STIGMA OF HIS LOVE FOR TEREZA; IN TEREZA'S EYES, THE STIGMA OF HIS EXPLOITS WITH THE MISTRESSES.

11
TO ASSUAGE TEREZA'S SUFFERINGS, HE MARRIED HER (THEY COULD FINALLY GIVE UP THE ROOM, WHICH SHE HAD NOT LIVED IN FOR QUITE SOME TIME) AND GAVE HER A PUPPY.

IT WAS BORN TO A SAINT BERNARD OWNED BY A COLLEAGUE. THE SIRE WAS A NEIGHBOR'S GERMAN SHEPHERD. NO ONE WANTED THE


24


LITTLE MONGRELS, AND HIS COLLEAGUE WAS LOATH TO KILL THEM.

LOOKING OVER THE PUPPIES, TOMAS KNEW THAT THE ONES HE REJECTED WOULD HAVE TO DIE. HE FELT LIKE THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC STANDING BEFORE FOUR PRISONERS CONDEMNED TO DEATH AND EMPOWERED TO PARDON ONLY ONE OF THEM. AT LAST HE MADE HIS CHOICE: A BITCH WHOSE BODY SEEMED REMINISCENT OF THE GERMAN SHEPHERD AND WHOSE HEAD BELONGED TO ITS SAINT BERNARD MOTHER. HE TOOK IT HOME TO TEREZA, WHO PICKED IT UP AND PRESSED IT TO HER BREAST. THE PUPPY IMMEDIATELY PEED ON HER BLOUSE.

THEN THEY TRIED TO COME UP WITH A NAME FOR IT. TOMAS WANTED THE NAME TO BE A CLEAR INDICATION THAT THE DOG WAS TEREZA'S, AND HE THOUGHT OF THE BOOK SHE WAS CLUTCHING UNDER HER ARM WHEN SHE ARRIVED UNANNOUNCED IN PRAGUE. HE SUGGESTED THEY CALL THE PUPPY TOLSTOY.

"IT CAN'T BE TOLSTOY," TEREZA SAID. "IT'S A GIRL. HOW ABOUT ANNA KARENINA?"

"IT CAN'T BE ANNA KARENINA," SAID TOMAS. "NO WOMAN COULD POSSIBLY HAVE SO FUNNY A FACE. IT'S MUCH MORE LIKE KARENIN. YES, ANNA'S HUSBAND. THAT'S JUST HOW I'VE ALWAYS PICTURED HIM."

"BUT WON'T CALLING HER KARENIN AFFECT HER SEXUALITY?"

"IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE," SAID TOMAS, "THAT A FEMALE DOG ADDRESSED CONTINUALLY BY A MALE NAME WILL DEVELOP LESBIAN TENDENCIES."

STRANGELY ENOUGH, TOMAS'S WORDS CAME TRUE. THOUGH BITCHES ARE USUALLY MORE AFFECTIONATE TO THEIR MASTERS THAN TO THEIR MISTRESSES, KARENIN PROVED AN EXCEPTION, DECIDING THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH TEREZA. TOMAS WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR IT. HE WOULD STROKE THE PUPPY'S HEAD AND SAY, "WELL DONE, KARENIN! THAT'S JUST WHAT I WANTED YOU FOR. SINCE I CAN'T COPE WITH HER BY MYSELF, YOU MUST HELP ME."

BUT EVEN WITH KARENIN'S HELP TOMAS FAILED TO MAKE HER HAPPY. HE BECAME AWARE OF HIS FAILURE SOME YEARS LATER, ON


25

APPROXIMATELY THE TENTH DAY AFTER HIS COUNTRY WAS OCCUPIED BY RUSSIAN TANKS. IT WAS AUGUST 1968, AND TOMAS WAS RECEIVING DAILY PHONE CALLS FROM A HOSPITAL IN ZURICH. THE DIRECTOR THERE, A PHYSICIAN WHO HAD STRUCK UP A FRIENDSHIP WITH TOMAS AT AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE, WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM AND KEPT OFFERING HIM A JOB.

12
IF TOMAS REJECTED THE SWISS DOCTOR'S OFFER WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT, IT WAS FOR TEREZA'S SAKE. HE ASSUMED SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO LEAVE. SHE HAD SPENT THE WHOLE FIRST WEEK OF THE OCCUPATION IN A KIND OF TRANCE ALMOST RESEMBLING HAPPINESS. AFTER ROAMING THE STREETS WITH HER CAMERA, SHE WOULD HAND THE ROLLS OF FILM TO FOREIGN JOURNALISTS, WHO ACTUALLY FOUGHT OVER THEM. ONCE, WHEN SHE WENT TOO FAR AND TOOK A CLOSE-UP OF AN OFFICER POINTING HIS REVOLVER AT A GROUP OF PEOPLE, SHE WAS ARRESTED AND KEPT OVERNIGHT AT RUSSIAN MILITARY HEADQUARTERS. THERE THEY THREATENED TO SHOOT HER, BUT NO SOONER DID THEY LET HER GO THAN SHE WAS BACK IN THE STREETS WITH HER CAMERA.

THAT IS WHY TOMAS WAS SURPRISED WHEN ON THE TENTH DAY OF THE OCCUPATION SHE SAID TO HIM, "WHY IS IT YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO SWITZERLAND?"              '

"WHY SHOULD I?"

"THEY COULD MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU HERE."

"THEY CAN MAKE IT HARD FOR ANYBODY," REPLIED TOMAS WITH A WAVE OF THE HAND. "WHAT ABOUT YOU? COULD YOU LIVE ABROAD?"

"WHY NOT?"


26


"YOU'VE BEEN OUT THERE RISKING YOUR LIFE FOR THIS COUNTRY. HOW CAN YOU BE SO NONCHALANT ABOUT LEAVING IT?"

"NOW THAT DUBCEK IS BACK, THINGS HAVE CHANGED," SAID TEREZA.

IT WAS TRUE: THE GENERAL EUPHORIA LASTED NO LONGER THAN THE FIRST WEEK. THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COUNTRY HAD BEEN HAULED AWAY LIKE CRIMINALS BY THE RUSSIAN ARMY, NO ONE KNEW WHERE THEY WERE, EVERYONE FEARED FOR THE MEN'S LIVES, AND HATRED FOR THE RUSSIANS DRUGGED PEOPLE LIKE ALCOHOL. IT WAS A DRUNKEN CARNIVAL OF HATE. CZECH TOWNS WERE DECORATED WITH THOUSANDS OF HAND-PAINTED POSTERS BEARING IRONIC TEXTS, EPIGRAMS, POEMS, AND CARTOONS OF BREZHNEV AND HIS SOLDIERS, JEERED AT BY ONE AND ALL AS A CIRCUS OF ILLITERATES. BUT NO CARNIVAL CAN GO ON FOREVER. IN THE MEANTIME, THE RUSSIANS HAD FORCED THE CZECH REPRESENTATIVES TO SIGN A COMPROMISE AGREEMENT IN MOSCOW. WHEN DUBCEK RETURNED WITH THEM TO PRAGUE, HE GAVE A SPEECH OVER THE RADIO. HE WAS SO DEVASTATED AFTER HIS SIX-DAY DETENTION HE COULD HARDLY TALK; HE KEPT STUTTERING AND GASPING FOR BREATH, MAKING LONG PAUSES BETWEEN SENTENCES, PAUSES LASTING NEARLY THIRTY SECONDS.

THE COMPROMISE SAVED THE COUNTRY FROM THE WORST: THE EXECUTIONS AND MASS DEPORTATIONS TO SIBERIA THAT HAD TERRIFIED EVERYONE. BUT ONE THING WAS CLEAR: THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE TO BOW TO THE CONQUEROR. FOR EVER AND EVER, IT WILL STUTTER, STAMMER, GASP FOR AIR LIKE ALEXANDER DUBCEK. THE CARNIVAL WAS OVER. WORKADAY HUMILIATION HAD BEGUN.

TEREZA HAD EXPLAINED ALL THIS TO TOMAS AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS TRUE. BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT UNDERNEATH IT ALL HID STILL ANOTHER, MORE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH, THE REASON WHY SHE WANTED TO LEAVE PRAGUE: SHE HAD NEVER REALLY BEEN HAPPY BEFORE.

THE DAYS SHE WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS OF PRAGUE TAKING PICTURES OF RUSSIAN SOLDIERS AND LOOKING DANGER IN THE FACE WERE THE BEST OF HER LIFE. THEY WERE THE ONLY TIME WHEN THE TELEVI-


27

SION SERIES OF HER DREAMS HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED AND SHE HAD ENJOYED A FEW HAPPY NIGHTS. THE RUSSIANS HAD BROUGHT EQUILIBRIUM TO HER IN THEIR TANKS, AND NOW THAT THE CARNIVAL WAS OVER, SHE FEARED HER NIGHTS AGAIN AND WANTED TO ESCAPE THEM. SHE NOW KNEW THERE WERE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH SHE COULD FEEL STRONG AND FULFILLED, AND SHE LONGED TO GO OFF INTO THE WORLD AND SEEK THOSE CONDITIONS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

"IT DOESN'T BOTHER YOU THAT SABINA HAS ALSO EMIGRATED TO SWITZERLAND?" TOMAS ASKED.

"GENEVA ISN'T ZURICH," SAID TEREZA. "SHE'LL BE MUCH LESS OF A DIFFICULTY THERE THAN SHE WAS IN PRAGUE."

A PERSON WHO LONGS TO LEAVE THE PLACE WHERE HE LIVES IS AN UNHAPPY PERSON. THAT IS WHY TOMAS ACCEPTED TEREZA'S WISH TO EMIGRATE AS THE CULPRIT ACCEPTS HIS SENTENCE, AND ONE DAY HE AND TEREZA AND KARENIN FOUND THEMSELVES IN THE LARGEST CITY IN SWITZERLAND.

13
HE BOUGHT A BED FOR THEIR EMPTY FLAT (THEY HAD NO MONEY YET FOR OTHER FURNITURE) AND THREW HIMSELF INTO HIS WORK WITH THE FRENZY OF A MAN OF FORTY BEGINNING A NEW LIFE.

HE MADE SEVERAL TELEPHONE CALLS TO GENEVA. A SHOW OF SABINA'S WORK HAD OPENED THERE BY CHANCE A WEEK AFTER THE RUSSIAN INVASION, AND IN A WAVE OF SYMPATHY FOR HER TINY COUNTRY, GENEVA'S PATRONS OF THE ARTS BOUGHT UP ALL HER PAINTINGS.

"THANKS TO THE RUSSIANS, I'M A RICH WOMAN," SHE SAID, LAUGHING INTO THE TELEPHONE. SHE INVITED TOMAS TO COME AND


28


SEE HER NEW STUDIO, AND ASSURED HIM IT DID NOT DIFFER GREATLY FROM THE ONE HE HAD KNOWN IN PRAGUE.

HE WOULD HAVE BEEN ONLY TOO GLAD TO VISIT HER, BUT WAS UNABLE TO FIND AN EXCUSE TO EXPLAIN HIS ABSENCE TO TEREZA. AND SO SABINA CAME TO ZURICH. SHE STAYED AT A HOTEL. TOMAS WENT TO SEE HER AFTER WORK. HE PHONED FIRST FROM THE RECEPTION DESK, THEN WENT UPSTAIRS. WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR, SHE STOOD BEFORE HIM ON HER BEAUTIFUL LONG LEGS WEARING NOTHING BUT PANTIES AND BRA. AND A BLACK BOWLER HAT. SHE STOOD THERE STARING, MUTE AND MOTIONLESS. TOMAS DID THE SAME. SUDDENLY HE REALIZED HOW TOUCHED HE WAS. HE REMOVED THE BOWLER FROM HER HEAD AND PLACED IT ON THE BEDSIDE TABLE. THEN THEY MADE LOVE WITHOUT SAYING A WORD.

LEAVING THE HOTEL FOR HIS HAT (WHICH BY NOW HAD ACQUIRED TABLE, CHAIRS, COUCH, AND CARPET), HE THOUGHT HAPPILY THAT HE CARRIED HIS WAY OF LIVING WITH HIM AS A SNAIL CARRIES HIS HOUSE. TEREZA AND SABINA REPRESENTED THE TWO POLES OF HIS LIFE, SEPARATE AND IRRECONCILABLE, YET EQUALLY APPEALING.

BUT THE FACT THAT HE CARRIED HIS LIFE-SUPPORT SYSTEM WITH HIM EVERYWHERE LIKE A PART OF HIS BODY MEANT THAT TEREZA WENT ON HAVING HER DREAMS.

THEY HAD BEEN IN ZURICH FOR SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS WHEN HE CAME HOME LATE ONE EVENING TO FIND A LETTER ON THE TABLE TELLING HIM SHE HAD LEFT FOR PRAGUE. SHE HAD LEFT BECAUSE SHE LACKED THE STRENGTH TO LIVE ABROAD. SHE KNEW SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO BOLSTER HIM UP, BUT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT. SHE HAD BEEN SILLY ENOUGH TO THINK THAT GOING ABROAD WOULD CHANGE HER. SHE THOUGHT THAT AFTER WHAT SHE HAD BEEN THROUGH DURING THE INVASION SHE WOULD STOP BEING PETTY AND GROW UP, GROW WISE AND STRONG, BUT SHE HAD OVERESTIMATED HERSELF. SHE WAS WEIGHING HIM DOWN AND WOULD DO SO NO LONGER. SHE HAD DRAWN THE NECESSARY CONCLUSIONS BEFORE IT WAS TOO LATE. AND SHE APOLOGIZED FOR TAKING KARENIN WITH HER.


29

HE TOOK SOME SLEEPING PILLS BUT STILL DID NOT CLOSE HIS EYES UNTIL MORNING. LUCKILY IT WAS SATURDAY AND HE COULD STAY AT HOME. FOR THE HUNDRED AND FIFTIETH TIME HE WENT OVER THE SITUATION: THE BORDERS BETWEEN HIS COUNTRY AND THE REST OF THE WORLD WERE NO LONGER OPEN. NO TELEGRAMS OR TELEPHONE CALLS COULD BRING HER BACK. THE AUTHORITIES WOULD NEVER LET HER TRAVEL ABROAD. HER DEPARTURE WAS STAGGERINGLY DEFINITIVE.

14
THE REALIZATION THAT HE WAS UTTERLY POWERLESS WAS LIKE THE BLOW OF A SLEDGEHAMMER, YET IT WAS CURIOUSLY CALMING AS WELL. NO ONE WAS FORCING HIM INTO A DECISION. HE FELT NO NEED TO STARE AT THE WALLS OF THE HOUSES ACROSS THE COURTYARD AND PONDER WHETHER TO LIVE WITH HER OR NOT. TEREZA HAD MADE THE DECISION HERSELF.

HE WENT TO A RESTAURANT FOR LUNCH. HE WAS DEPRESSED, BUT AS HE ATE, HIS ORIGINAL DESPERATION WANED, LOST ITS STRENGTH, AND SOON ALL THAT WAS LEFT WAS MELANCHOLY. LOOKING BACK ON THE YEARS HE HAD SPENT WITH HER, HE CAME TO FEEL THAT THEIR STORY COULD HAVE HAD NO BETTER ENDING. IF SOMEONE HAD INVENTED THE STORY, THIS IS HOW HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO END IT.

ONE DAY TEREZA CAME TO HIM UNINVITED. ONE DAY SHE LEFT THE SAME WAY. SHE CAME WITH A HEAVY SUITCASE. SHE LEFT WITH A HEAVY SUITCASE.

HE PAID THE BILL, LEFT THE RESTAURANT, AND STARTED WALKING THROUGH THE STREETS, HIS MELANCHOLY GROWING MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL. HE HAD SPENT SEVEN YEARS OF LIFE WITH TEREZA, AND NOW HE REALIZED THAT THOSE YEARS WERE MORE ATTRACTIVE IN RETRO-


30


SPECT THAN THEY WERE WHEN HE WAS LIVING THEM.

HIS LOVE FOR TEREZA WAS BEAUTIFUL, BUT IT WAS ALSO TIRING: HE HAD CONSTANTLY HAD TO HIDE THINGS FROM HER, SHAM, DISSEMBLE, MAKE AMENDS, BUCK HER UP, CALM HER DOWN, GIVE HER EVIDENCE OF HIS FEELINGS, PLAY THE DEFENDANT TO HER JEALOUSY, HER SUFFERING, AND HER DREAMS, FEEL GUILTY, MAKE EXCUSES AND APOLOGIES. NOW WHAT WAS TIRING HAD DISAPPEARED AND ONLY THE BEAUTY REMAINED.

SATURDAY FOUND HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME STROLLING ALONE THROUGH ZURICH, BREATHING IN THE HEADY SMELL OF HIS FREEDOM. NEW ADVENTURES HID AROUND EACH CORNER. THE FUTURE WAS AGAIN A SECRET. HE WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO THE BACHELOR LIFE, THE LIFE HE HAD ONCE FELT DESTINED FOR, THE LIFE THAT WOULD LET HIM BE WHAT HE ACTUALLY WAS.

FOR SEVEN YEARS HE HAD LIVED BOUND TO HER, HIS EVERY STEP SUBJECT TO HER SCRUTINY. SHE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE CHAINED IRON BALLS TO HIS ANKLES. SUDDENLY HIS STEP WAS MUCH LIGHTER. HE SOARED. HE HAD ENTERED PARMENIDES' MAGIC FIELD: HE WAS ENJOYING THE SWEET LIGHTNESS OF BEING.

(DID HE FEEL LIKE PHONING SABINA IN GENEVA? CONTACTING ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE WOMEN HE HAD MET DURING HIS SEVERAL MONTHS IN ZURICH? NO, NOT IN THE LEAST. PERHAPS HE SENSED THAT ANY WOMAN WOULD MAKE HIS MEMORY OF TEREZA UNBEARABLY PAINFUL.)

15
THIS CURIOUS MELANCHOLIC FASCINATION LASTED UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING. .ON MONDAY, EVERYTHING CHANGED. TEREZA FORCED HER WAY INTO HIS THOUGHTS: HE IMAGINED HER SITTING THERE WRITING HER


31

FAREWELL LETTER; HE FELT HER HANDS TREMBLING; HE SAW HER LUGGING HER HEAVY SUITCASE IN ONE HAND AND LEADING KARENIN ON HIS LEASH WITH THE OTHER; HE PICTURED HER UNLOCKING THEIR PRAGUE FLAT, AND SUFFERED THE UTTER ABANDONMENT BREATHING HER IN THE FACE AS SHE OPENED THE DOOR.

DURING THOSE TWO BEAUTIFUL DAYS OF MELANCHOLY, HIS COMPASSION (THAT CURSE OF EMOTIONAL TELEPATHY) HAD TAKEN A HOLIDAY. IT HAD SLEPT THE SOUND SUNDAY SLEEP OF A MINER WHO, AFTER A HARD WEEK'S WORK, NEEDS TO GATHER STRENGTH FOR HIS MONDAY SHIFT.

    INSTEAD OF THE PATIENTS HE WAS TREATING, TOMAS SAW TEREZA.

HE TRIED TO REMIND HIMSELF. DON'T THINK ABOUT HER! DON'T THINK ABOUT HER! HE SAID TO HIMSELF, I'M SICK WITH COMPASSION. IT'S GOOD THAT SHE'S GONE AND THAT I'LL NEVER SEE HER AGAIN, THOUGH IT'S NOT TEREZA I NEED TO BE FREE OF—IT'S THAT SICKNESS, COMPASSION, WHICH I THOUGHT I WAS IMMUNE TO UNTIL SHE INFECTED ME WITH IT.

ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, HE FELT THE SWEET LIGHTNESS OF BEING RISE UP TO HIM OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF THE FUTURE. ON MONDAY, HE WAS HIT BY A WEIGHT THE LIKES OF WHICH HE HAD NEVER KNOWN. THE TONS OF STEEL OF THE RUSSIAN TANKS WERE NOTHING COMPARED WITH IT. FOR THERE IS NOTHING HEAVIER THAN COMPASSION. NOT EVEN ONE'S OWN PAIN WEIGHS SO HEAVY AS THE PAIN ONE FEELS WITH SOMEONE, FOR SOMEONE, A PAIN INTENSIFIED BY THE IMAGINATION AND PROLONGED BY A HUNDRED ECHOES.

HE KEPT WARNING HIMSELF NOT TO GIVE IN TO COMPASSION, AND COMPASSION LISTENED WITH BOWED HEAD AND A SEEMINGLY GUILTY CONSCIENCE. COMPASSION KNEW IT WAS BEING PRESUMPTUOUS, YET IT QUIETLY STOOD ITS GROUND, AND ON THE FIFTH DAY AFTER HER DEPARTURE TOMAS INFORMED THE DIRECTOR OF HIS HOSPITAL (THE MAN WHO HAD PHONED HIM DAILY IN PRAGUE AFTER THE RUSSIAN INVASION) THAT HE HAD TO RETURN AT ONCE. HE WAS ASHAMED. HE KNEW THAT THE MOVE WOULD APPEAR IRRESPONSIBLE, INEXCUSABLE TO THE MAN. HE THOUGHT TO UNBOSOM HIMSELF AND TELL HIM THE STORY OF TEREZA AND THE LETTER SHE HAD LEFT ON THE TABLE FOR HIM. BUT IN THE END


32


HE DID NOT. FROM THE SWISS DOCTOR'S POINT OF VIEW TEREZA'S MOVE COULD ONLY APPEAR HYSTERICAL AND ABHORRENT. AND TOMAS REFUSED TO ALLOW ANYONE AN OPPORTUNITY TO THINK ILL OF HER. THE DIRECTOR OF THE HOSPITAL WAS IN FACT OFFENDED. TOMAS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SAID, "ES MUSS SEIN. ES MUSS SEIN."

IT WAS AN ALLUSION. THE LAST MOVEMENT OF BEETHOVEN'S LAST QUARTET IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING TWO MOTIFS:



TO MAKE THE MEANING OF THE WORDS ABSOLUTELY CLEAR, BEETHOVEN INTRODUCED THE MOVEMENT WITH A PHRASE, "DER SCHWER GEFASSTE ENTSCHLUSS," WHICH IS COMMONLY TRANSLATED AS "THE DIFFICULT RESOLUTION."

THIS ALLUSION TO BEETHOVEN WAS ACTUALLY TOMAS'S FIRST STEP BACK TO TEREZA, BECAUSE SHE WAS THE ONE WHO HAD INDUCED HIM TO BUY RECORDS OF THE BEETHOVEN QUARTETS AND SONATAS.

THE ALLUSION WAS EVEN MORE PERTINENT THAN HE HAD THOUGHT BECAUSE THE SWISS DOCTOR WAS A GREAT MUSIC LOVER. SMILING SERENELY, HE ASKED, IN THE MELODY OF BEETHOVEN'S MOTIF, "MUSS ES SEIN?"

"]A, ES MUSS SEIN!" TOMAS SAID AGAIN.


16
UNLIKE PARMENIDES, BEETHOVEN APPARENTLY VIEWED WEIGHT AS SOMETHING POSITIVE. SINCE THE GERMAN WORD SCHWER MEANS BOTH "DIFFICULT" AND "HEAVY," BEETHOVEN'S "DIFFICULT RESOLUTION" MAY ALSO BE CONSTRUED AS A "HEAVY" OR "WEIGHTY RESOLUTION." THE WEIGHTY RESOLUTION IS AT ONE WITH THE VOICE OF FATE ("ES MUSS SEIN!"); NECESSITY, WEIGHT, AND VALUE ARE THREE CONCEPTS INEXTRICABLY BOUND: ONLY NECESSITY IS HEAVY, AND ONLY WHAT IS HEAVY HAS VALUE.

THIS IS A CONVICTION BORN OF BEETHOVEN'S MUSIC, AND ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT IGNORE THE POSSIBILITY (OR EVEN PROBABILITY) THAT IT OWES ITS ORIGINS MORE TO BEETHOVEN'S COMMENTATORS THAN TO BEETHOVEN HIMSELF, WE ALL MORE OR LESS SHARE, IT: WE BELIEVE THAT THE GREATNESS OF MAN STEMS FROM THE FACT THAT HE BEARS HIS FATE AS ATLAS BORE THE HEAVENS ON HIS SHOULDERS. BEETHOVEN'S HERO IS A LIFTER OF METAPHYSICAL WEIGHTS.

TOMAS APPROACHED THE SWISS BORDER. I IMAGINE A GLOOMY, SHOCK-HEADED BEETHOVEN, IN PERSON, CONDUCTING THE LOCAL FIREMEN'S BRASS BAND IN A FAREWELL TO EMIGRATION, AN "ES MUSS SEIN " MARCH.

THEN TOMAS CROSSED THE CZECH BORDER AND WAS WELCOMED BY COLUMNS OF RUSSIAN TANKS. HE HAD TO STOP HIS CAR AND WAIT A HALF HOUR BEFORE THEY PASSED. A TERRIFYING SOLDIER IN THE BLACK UNIFORM OF THE ARMORED FORCES STOOD AT THE CROSSROADS DIRECTING TRAFFIC AS IF EVERY ROAD IN THE COUNTRY BELONGED TO HIM AND HIM ALONE.

"ES MUSS SEIN!" TOMAS REPEATED TO HIMSELF, BUT THEN HE BEGAN TO DOUBT. DID IT REALLY HAVE TO BE?

YES, IT WAS UNBEARABLE FOR HIM TO STAY IN ZURICH IMAGINING TEREZA LIVING ON HER OWN IN PRAGUE.

BUT HOW LONG WOULD HE HAVE BEEN TORTURED BY COMPASSION? ALL HIS LIFE? A YEAR? OR A MONTH? OR ONLY A WEEK?

33


34


HOW COULD HE HAVE KNOWN? HOW COULD HE HAVE GAUGED IT? ANY SCHOOLBOY CAN DO EXPERIMENTS IN THE PHYSICS LABORATORY TO TEST VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESES. BUT MAN, BECAUSE HE HAS ONLY ONE LIFE TO LIVE, CANNOT CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS TO TEST WHETHER TO FOLLOW HIS PASSION (COMPASSION) OR NOT.

IT WAS WITH THESE THOUGHTS IN MIND THAT HE OPENED THE DOOR TO HIS FLAT. KARENIN MADE THE HOMECOMING EASIER BY JUMPING UP ON HIM AND LICKING HIS FACE. THE DESIRE TO FALL INTO TEREZA'S ARMS (HE COULD STILL FEEL IT WHILE GETTING INTO HIS CAR IN ZURICH) HAD COMPLETELY DISINTEGRATED. HE FANCIED HIMSELF STANDING OPPOSITE HER IN THE MIDST OF A SNOWY PLAIN, THE TWO OF THEM SHIVERING FROM THE COLD.

17
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE OCCUPATION, RUSSIAN MILITARY AIRPLANES HAD FLOWN OVER PRAGUE ALL NIGHT LONG. TOMAS, NO LONGER ACCUSTOMED TO THE NOISE, WAS UNABLE TO FALL ASLEEP.

TWISTING AND TURNING BESIDE THE SLUMBERING TEREZA, HE RECALLED SOMETHING SHE HAD TOLD HIM A LONG TIME BEFORE IN THE COURSE OF AN INSIGNIFICANT CONVERSATION. THEY HAD BEEN TALKING ABOUT HIS FRIEND Z. WHEN SHE ANNOUNCED, "IF I HADN'T MET YOU, I'D CERTAINLY HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM."

EVEN THEN, HER WORDS HAD LEFT TOMAS IN A STRANGE STATE OF MELANCHOLY, AND NOW HE REALIZED IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF CHANCE THAT TEREZA LOVED HIM AND NOT HIS FRIEND Z. APART FROM HER CONSUMMATED LOVE FOR TOMAS, THERE WERE, IN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY, AN INFINITE NUMBER OF UNCONSUMMATED LOVES FOR OTHER MEN.


                                           35

WE ALL REJECT OUT OF HAND THE IDEA THAT THE LOVE OF OUR LIFE MAY BE SOMETHING LIGHT OR WEIGHTLESS; WE PRESUME OUR LOVE IS WHAT MUST BE, THAT WITHOUT IT OUR LIFE WOULD NO LONGER BE THE SAME; WE FEEL THAT BEETHOVEN HIMSELF, GLOOMY AND AWE-INSPIRING, IS PLAYING THE "ES MUSS SEIN!" TO OUR OWN GREAT LOVE.

TOMAS OFTEN THOUGHT OF TEREZA'S REMARK ABOUT HIS FRIEND Z. AND CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE LOVE STORY OF HIS LIFE EXEMPLIFIED NOT "ES MUSS SEIN! " (IT MUST BE SO), BUT RATHER "ES KONNTE AUCH ANDERS SEIN" (IT COULD JUST AS WELL BE OTHERWISE).

SEVEN YEARS EARLIER, A COMPLEX NEUROLOGICAL CASE HAPPENED TO HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED AT THE HOSPITAL IN TEREZA'S TOWN. THEY CALLED IN THE CHIEF SURGEON OF TOMAS'S HOSPITAL IN PRAGUE FOR CONSULTATION, BUT THE CHIEF SURGEON OF TOMAS'S HOSPITAL HAPPENED TO BE SUFFERING FROM SCIATICA, AND BECAUSE HE COULD NOT MOVE HE SENT TOMAS TO THE PROVINCIAL HOSPITAL IN HIS PLACE. THE TOWN HAD SEVERAL HOTELS, BUT TOMAS HAPPENED TO BE GIVEN A ROOM IN THE ONE WHERE TEREZA WAS EMPLOYED. HE HAPPENED TO HAVE HAD ENOUGH FREE TIME BEFORE HIS TRAIN LEFT TO STOP AT THE HOTEL RESTAURANT. TEREZA HAPPENED TO BE ON DUTY, AND HAPPENED TO BE SERVING TOMAS'S TABLE. IT HAD TAKEN SIX CHANCE HAPPENINGS TO PUSH TOMAS TOWARDS TEREZA, AS IF HE HAD LITTLE INCLINATION TO GO TO HER ON HIS OWN.

HE HAD GONE BACK TO PRAGUE BECAUSE OF HER. SO FATEFUL A DECISION RESTING ON SO FORTUITOUS A LOVE, A LOVE THAT WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE EXISTED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CHIEF SURGEON'S SCIATICA SEVEN YEARS EARLIER. AND THAT WOMAN, THAT PERSONIFICATION OF ABSOLUTE FORTUITY, NOW AGAIN LAY ASLEEP BESIDE HIM, BREATHING DEEPLY.

IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT. HIS STOMACH STARTED ACTING UP AS IT TENDED TO DO IN TIMES OF PSYCHIC STRESS.

ONCE OR TWICE HER BREATHING TURNED INTO MILD SNORES. TOMAS FELT NO COMPASSION. ALL HE FELT WAS THE PRESSURE IN HIS STOMACH AND THE DESPAIR OF HAVING RETURNED.


PART TWO
SOUL AND BODY

1
IT WOULD BE SENSELESS FOR THE AUTHOR TO TRY TO CONVINCE THE READER THAT HIS CHARACTERS ONCE ACTUALLY LIVED. THEY WERE NOT BORN OF A MOTHER'S WOMB; THEY WERE BORN OF A STIMULATING PHRASE OR TWO OR FROM A BASIC SITUATION. TOMAS WAS BORN OF THE SAYING "EINMA! IST KEINMAL." TEREZA WAS BORN OF THE RUMBLING OF A STOMACH.

THE FIRST TIME SHE WENT TO TOMAS'S FLAT, HER INSIDES BEGAN TO RUMBLE. AND NO WONDER: SHE HAD HAD NOTHING TO EAT SINCE BREAKFAST BUT A QUICK SANDWICH ON THE PLATFORM BEFORE BOARDING THE TRAIN. SHE HAD CONCENTRATED ON THE DARING JOURNEY AHEAD OF HER AND FORGOTTEN ABOUT FOOD. BUT WHEN WE IGNORE THE BODY, WE ARE MORE EASILY VICTIMIZED BY IT. SHE FELT TERRIBLE STANDING THERE IN FRONT OF TOMAS LISTENING TO HER BELLY SPEAK OUT. SHE FELT LIKE CRYING. FORTUNATELY, AFTER THE FIRST TEN SECONDS TOMAS PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND MADE HER FORGET HER VENTRAL VOICES.

39


2
TEREZA WAS THEREFORE BORN OF A SITUATION WHICH BRUTALLY REVEALS THE IRRECONCILABLE DUALITY OF BODY AND SOUL, THAT FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN EXPERIENCE.

A LONG TIME AGO, MAN WOULD LISTEN IN AMAZEMENT TO THE SOUND OF REGULAR BEATS IN HIS CHEST, NEVER SUSPECTING WHAT THEY WERE. HE WAS UNABLE TO IDENTIFY HIMSELF WITH SO ALIEN AND UNFAMILIAR AN OBJECT AS THE BODY. THE BODY WAS A CAGE, AND INSIDE THAT CAGE WAS SOMETHING WHICH LOOKED, LISTENED, FEARED, THOUGHT, AND MARVELED; THAT SOMETHING, THAT REMAINDER LEFT OVER AFTER THE BODY HAD BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR, WAS THE SOUL.

TODAY, OF COURSE, THE BODY IS NO LONGER UNFAMILIAR: WE KNOW THAT THE BEATING IN OUR CHEST IS THE HEART AND THAT THE NOSE IS THE NOZZLE OF A HOSE STICKING OUT OF THE BODY TO TAKE OXYGEN TO THE LUNGS. THE FACE IS NOTHING BUT AN INSTRUMENT PANEL REGISTERING ALL THE BODY MECHANISMS: DIGESTION, SIGHT, HEARING, RESPIRATION, THOUGHT.

EVER SINCE MAN HAS LEARNED TO GIVE EACH PART OF THE BODY A NAME, THE BODY HAS GIVEN HIM LESS TROUBLE. HE HAS ALSO LEARNED THAT THE SOUL IS NOTHING MORE THAN THE GRAY MATTER OF THE BRAIN IN ACTION. THE OLD DUALITY OF BODY AND SOUL HAS BECOME SHROUDED IN SCIENTIFIC TERMINOLOGY, AND WE CAN LAUGH AT IT AS MERELY AN OBSOLETE PREJUDICE.

BUT JUST MAKE SOMEONE WHO HAS FALLEN IN LOVE LISTEN TO HIS STOMACH RUMBLE, AND THE UNITY OF BODY AND SOUL, THAT LYRICAL ILLUSION OF THE AGE OF SCIENCE, INSTANTLY FADES AWAY.

40


3
TEREZA TRIED TO SEE HERSELF THROUGH HER BODY. THAT IS WHY, FROM GIRLHOOD ON, SHE WOULD STAND BEFORE THE MIRROR SO OFTEN. AND BECAUSE SHE WAS AFRAID HER MOTHER WOULD CATCH HER AT IT, EVERY PEEK INTO THE MIRROR HAD A TINGE OF SECRET VICE.

IT WAS NOT VANITY THAT DREW HER TO THE MIRROR; IT WAS AMAZEMENT AT SEEING HER OWN "I." SHE FORGOT SHE WAS LOOKING AT THE INSTRUMENT PANEL OF HER BODY MECHANISMS; SHE THOUGHT SHE SAW HER SOUL SHINING THROUGH THE FEATURES OF HER FACE. SHE FORGOT THAT THE NOSE WAS MERELY THE NOZZLE OF A HOSE THAT TOOK OXYGEN TO THE LUNGS; SHE SAW IT AS THE TRUE EXPRESSION OF HER NATURE.

STARING AT HERSELF FOR LONG STRETCHES OF TIME, SHE WAS OCCASIONALLY UPSET AT THE SIGHT OF HER MOTHER'S FEATURES IN HER FACE. SHE WOULD STARE ALL THE MORE DOGGEDLY AT HER IMAGE IN AN ATTEMPT TO WISH THEM AWAY AND KEEP ONLY WHAT WAS HERS ALONE. EACH TIME SHE SUCCEEDED WAS A TIME OF INTOXICATION: HER SOUL WOULD RISE TO THE SURFACE OF HER BODY LIKE A CREW CHARGING UP FROM THE BOWELS OF A SHIP, SPREADING OUT OVER THE DECK, WAVING AT THE SKY AND SINGING IN JUBILATION.

4
SHE TOOK AFTER HER MOTHER, AND NOT ONLY PHYSICALLY. I SOMETIMES HAVE THE FEELING THAT HER ENTIRE LIFE WAS MERELY A CONTINUATION OF HER MOTHER'S, MUCH AS THE COURSE OF A BALL ON THE BILLIARD TABLE IS MERELY THE CONTINUATION OF THE PLAYER'S ARM MOVEMENT.

41


44

INDEED, WAS SHE NOT THE PRINCIPAL CULPRIT DETERMINING HER MOTHER'S FATE? SHE, THE ABSURD ENCOUNTER OF THE SPERM OF THE MOST MANLY OF MEN AND THE EGG OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WOMEN? YES, IT WAS IN THAT FATEFUL SECOND, WHICH WAS NAMED TEREZA, THAT THE BOTCHED LONG-DISTANCE RACE, HER MOTHER'S LIFE, HAD BEGUN.

TEREZA'S MOTHER NEVER STOPPED REMINDING HER THAT BEING A MOTHER MEANT SACRIFICING EVERYTHING. HER WORDS HAD THE RING OF TRUTH, BACKED AS THEY WERE BY THE EXPERIENCE OF A WOMAN WHO HAD LOST EVERYTHING BECAUSE OF HER CHILD. TEREZA WOULD LISTEN AND BELIEVE THAT BEING A MOTHER WAS THE HIGHEST VALUE IN LIFE AND THAT BEING A MOTHER WAS A GREAT SACRIFICE. IF A MOTHER WAS SACRIFICE PERSONIFIED, THEN A DAUGHTER WAS GUILT, WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF REDRESS.

6
OF COURSE, TEREZA DID NOT KNOW THE STORY OF THE NIGHT WHEN HER MOTHER WHISPERED "BE CAREFUL" INTO THE EAR OF HER FATHER. HER GUILTY CONSCIENCE WAS AS VAGUE AS ORIGINAL SIN. BUT SHE DID WHAT SHE COULD TO RID HERSELF OF IT. HER MOTHER TOOK HER OUT OF SCHOOL AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN, AND TEREZA WENT TO WORK AS A WAITRESS, HANDING OVER ALL HER EARNINGS. SHE WAS WILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO GAIN HER MOTHER'S LOVE. SHE RAN THE HOUSEHOLD, TOOK CARE OF HER SIBLINGS, AND SPENT ALL DAY SUNDAY CLEANING HOUSE AND DOING THE FAMILY WASH. IT WAS A PITY, BECAUSE SHE WAS THE BRIGHTEST IN HER CLASS. SHE YEARNED FOR SOMETHING HIGHER, BUT IN THE SMALL TOWN THERE WAS NOTHING HIGHER FOR HER. WHENEVER SHE DID THE


45

CLOTHES, SHE KEPT A BOOK NEXT TO THE TUB. AS SHE TURNED THE PAGES, THE WASH WATER DRIPPED ALL OVER THEM.

AT HOME, THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS SHAME. HER MOTHER MARCHED ABOUT THE FLAT IN HER UNDERWEAR, SOMETIMES BRALESS AND SOMETIMES, ON SUMMER DAYS, STARK NAKED. HER STEPFATHER DID NOT WALK ABOUT NAKED, BUT HE DID GO INTO THE BATHROOM EVERY TIME TEREZA WAS IN THE BATH. ONCE SHE LOCKED HERSELF IN AND HER MOTHER WAS FURIOUS. "WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, ANYWAY? DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO BITE OFF A PIECE OF YOUR BEAUTY?"

(THIS CONFRONTATION SHOWS CLEARLY THAT HATRED FOR HER DAUGHTER OUTWEIGHED SUSPICION OF HER HUSBAND. HER DAUGHTER'S GUILT WAS INFINITE AND INCLUDED THE HUSBAND'S INFIDELITIES. TEREZA'S DESIRE TO BE EMANCIPATED AND INSIST ON HER RIGHTS—LIKE THE RIGHT TO LOCK HERSELF IN THE BATHROOM—WAS MORE OBJECTIONABLE TO TEREZA'S MOTHER THAN THE POSSIBILITY OF HER HUSBAND'S TAKING A PRURIENT INTEREST IN TEREZA.)

ONCE HER MOTHER DECIDED TO GO NAKED IN THE WINTER WHEN THE LIGHTS WERE ON. TEREZA QUICKLY RAN TO PULL THE CURTAINS SO THAT NO ONE COULD SEE HER FROM ACROSS THE STREET. SHE HEARD HER MOTHER'S LAUGHTER BEHIND HER. THE FOLLOWING DAY HER MOTHER HAD SOME FRIENDS OVER: A NEIGHBOR, A WOMAN SHE WORKED WITH, A LOCAL SCHOOLMISTRESS, AND TWO OR THREE OTHER WOMEN IN THE HABIT OF GETTING TOGETHER REGULARLY. TEREZA AND THE SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLD SON OF ONE OF THEM CAME IN AT ONE POINT TO SAY HELLO, AND HER MOTHER IMMEDIATELY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THEIR PRESENCE TO TELL HOW TEREZA HAD TRIED TO PROTECT HER MOTHER'S MODESTY. SHE LAUGHED, AND ALL THE WOMEN LAUGHED WITH HER. "TEREZA CAN'T RECONCILE HERSELF TO THE IDEA THAT THE HUMAN BODY PISSES AND FARTS," SHE SAID. TEREZA TURNED BRIGHT RED, BUT HER MOTHER WOULD NOT STOP. "WHAT'S SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THAT?" AND IN ANSWER TO HER OWN QUESTION SHE BROKE WIND LOUDLY. ALL THE WOMEN LAUGHED AGAIN.


7
TEREZA'S MOTHER BLEW HER NOSE NOISILY, TALKED TO PEOPLE IN PUBLIC ABOUT HER SEX LIFE, AND ENJOYED DEMONSTRATING HER FALSE TEETH. SHE WAS REMARKABLY SKILLFUL AT LOOSENING THEM WITH HER TONGUE, AND IN THE MIDST OF A BROAD SMILE WOULD CAUSE THE UPPERS TO DROP DOWN OVER THE LOWERS IN SUCH A WAY AS TO GIVE HER FACE A SINISTER EXPRESSION.

HER BEHAVIOR WAS BUT A SINGLE GRAND GESTURE, A CASTING OFF OF YOUTH AND BEAUTY. IN THE DAYS WHEN SHE HAD HAD NINE SUITORS KNEELING ROUND HER IN A CIRCLE, SHE GUARDED HER NAKEDNESS APPREHENSIVELY, AS THOUGH TRYING TO EXPRESS THE VALUE OF HER BODY IN TERMS OF THE MODESTY SHE ACCORDED IT. NOW SHE HAD NOT ONLY LOST THAT MODESTY, SHE HAD RADICALLY BROKEN WITH IT, CEREMONIOUSLY USING HER NEW IMMODESTY TO DRAW A DIVIDING LINE THROUGH HER LIFE AND PROCLAIM THAT YOUTH AND BEAUTY WERE OVERRATED AND WORTHLESS.

TEREZA APPEARS TO ME A CONTINUATION OF THE GESTURE BY WHICH HER MOTHER CAST OFF HER LIFE AS A YOUNG BEAUTY, CAST IT FAR BEHIND HER.

(AND IF TEREZA HAS A NERVOUS WAY OF MOVING, IF HER GESTURES LACK A CERTAIN EASY GRACE, WE MUST NOT BE SURPRISED: HER MOTHER'S GRAND, WILD, AND SELF-DESTRUCTIVE GESTURE HAS LEFT AN INDELIBLE IMPRINT ON HER.)

46


8
TEREZA'S MOTHER DEMANDED JUSTICE. SHE WANTED TO SEE THE CULPRIT PENALIZED. THAT IS WHY SHE INSISTED HER DAUGHTER REMAIN WITH HER IN THE WORLD OF IMMODESTY, WHERE YOUTH AND BEAUTY MEAN NOTHING, WHERE THE WORLD IS NOTHING BUT A VAST CONCENTRATION CAMP OF BODIES, ONE LIKE THE NEXT, WITH SOULS INVISIBLE.

NOW WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MEANING OF TEREZA'S SECRET VICE, HER LONG LOOKS AND FREQUENT GLANCES IN THE MIRROR. IT WAS A BATTLE WITH HER MOTHER. IT WAS A LONGING TO BE A BODY UNLIKE OTHER BODIES, TO FIND THAT THE SURFACE OF HER FACE REFLECTED THE CREW OF THE SOUL CHARGING UP FROM BELOW. IT WAS NOT AN EASY TASK: HER SOUL—HER SAD, TIMID, SELF-EFFACING SOUL—LAY CONCEALED IN THE DEPTHS OF HER BOWELS AND WAS ASHAMED TO SHOW ITSELF.

SO IT WAS THE DAY SHE FIRST MET TOMAS. WEAVING ITS WAY THROUGH THE DRUNKS IN THE HOTEL RESTAURANT, HER BODY SAGGED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BEERS ON THE TRAY, AND HER SOUL LAY SOMEWHERE AT THE LEVEL OF THE STOMACH OR PANCREAS. THEN TOMAS CALLED TO HER. THAT CALL MEANT A GREAT DEAL, BECAUSE IT CAME FROM SOMEONE WHO KNEW NEITHER HER MOTHER NOR THE DRUNKS WITH THEIR DAILY STEREOTYPICALLY SCABROUS REMARKS. HIS OUTSIDER STATUS RAISED HIM ABOVE THE REST.

SOMETHING ELSE RAISED HIM ABOVE THE OTHERS AS WELL: HE HAD AN OPEN BOOK ON HIS TABLE. NO ONE HAD EVER OPENED A BOOK IN THAT RESTAURANT BEFORE. IN TEREZA'S EYES, BOOKS WERE THE EMBLEMS OF A SECRET BROTHERHOOD. FOR SHE HAD BUT A SINGLE WEAPON AGAINST THE WORLD OF CRUDITY SURROUNDING HER: THE BOOKS SHE TOOK OUT OF THE MUNICIPAL LIBRARY, AND ABOVE ALL, THE NOVELS. SHE HAD READ ANY NUMBER OF THEM, FROM FIELDING TO THOMAS MANN. THEY NOT ONLY OFFERED THE POSSIBILITY OF AN IMAGINARY ESCAPE FROM A LIFE SHE FOUND UNSATISFYING; THEY ALSO HAD A MEANING FOR HER AS PHYSICAL OBJECTS: SHE LOVED TO WALK DOWN THE STREET WITH A

48

BOOK UNDER HER ARM. IT HAD THE SAME SIGNIFICANCE FOR HER AS AN ELEGANT CANE FOR THE DANDY A CENTURY AGO. IT DIFFERENTIATED HER FROM OTHERS.

(COMPARING THE BOOK TO THE ELEGANT CANE OF THE DANDY IS NOT ABSOLUTELY PRECISE. A DANDY'S CANE DID MORE THAN MAKE HIM DIFFERENT; IT MADE HIM MODERN AND UP TO DATE. THE BOOK MADE TEREZA DIFFERENT, BUT OLD-FASHIONED. OF COURSE, SHE WAS TOO YOUNG TO SEE HOW OLD-FASHIONED SHE LOOKED TO OTHERS. THE YOUNG MEN WALKING BY WITH TRANSISTOR RADIOS PRESSED TO THEIR EARS SEEMED SILLY TO HER. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO HER THAT THEY WERE MODERN.)

AND SO THE MAN WHO CALLED TO HER WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY A STRANGER AND A MEMBER OF THE SECRET BROTHERHOOD. HE CALLED TO HER IN A KIND VOICE, AND TEREZA FELT HER SOUL RUSHING UP TO THE SURFACE THROUGH HER BLOOD VESSELS AND PORES TO SHOW ITSELF TO HIM.

AFTER TOMAS HAD RETURNED TO PRAGUE FROM ZURICH, HE BEGAN TO FEEL UNEASY AT THE THOUGHT THAT HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH TEREZA WAS THE RESULT OF SIX IMPROBABLE FORTUITIES.

BUT IS NOT AN EVENT IN FACT MORE SIGNIFICANT AND NOTEWORTHY THE GREATER THE NUMBER OF FORTUITIES NECESSARY TO BRING IT ABOUT?

CHANCE AND CHANCE ALONE HAS A MESSAGE FOR US. EVERYTHING THAT OCCURS OUT OF NECESSITY, EVERYTHING EXPECTED, REPEATED DAY IN AND DAY OUT, IS MUTE. ONLY CHANCE CAN SPEAK TO US. WE READ ITS MESSAGE MUCH AS GYPSIES READ THE IMAGES MADE BY COFFEE


49

GROUNDS AT THE BOTTOM OF A CUP.

TOMAS APPEARED TO TEREZA IN THE HOTEL RESTAURANT AS CHANCE IN THE ABSOLUTE. THERE HE SAT, PORING OVER AN OPEN BOOK, WHEN SUDDENLY HE RAISED HIS EYES TO HER, SMILED, AND SAID, "A COGNAC, PLEASE."

AT THAT MOMENT, THE RADIO HAPPENED TO BE PLAYING MUSIC. ON HER WAY BEHIND THE COUNTER TO POUR THE COGNAC, TEREZA TURNED THE VOLUME UP. SHE RECOGNIZED BEETHOVEN. SHE HAD KNOWN HIS MUSIC FROM THE TIME A STRING QUARTET FROM PRAGUE HAD VISITED THEIR TOWN. TEREZA (WHO, AS WE KNOW, YEARNED FOR "SOMETHING HIGHER") WENT TO THE CONCERT. THE HALL WAS NEARLY EMPTY. THE ONLY OTHER PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WERE THE LOCAL PHARMACIST AND HIS WIFE. AND ALTHOUGH THE QUARTET OF MUSICIANS ON STAGE FACED ONLY A TRIO OF SPECTATORS DOWN BELOW, THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH NOT TO CANCEL THE CONCERT, AND GAVE A PRIVATE PERFORMANCE OF THE LAST THREE BEETHOVEN QUARTETS.

THEN THE PHARMACIST INVITED THE MUSICIANS TO DINNER AND ASKED THE GIRL IN THE AUDIENCE TO COME ALONG WITH THEM. FROM THEN ON, BEETHOVEN BECAME HER IMAGE OF THE WORLD ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE WORLD SHE YEARNED FOR. ROUNDING THE COUNTER WITH TOMAS'S COGNAC, SHE TRIED TO READ CHANCE'S MESSAGE: HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT SHE WAS TAKING AN ORDER OF COGNAC TO A STRANGER SHE FOUND ATTRACTIVE, AT THAT VERY MOMENT SHE HEARD BEETHOVEN?

NECESSITY KNOWS NO MAGIC FORMULAE—THEY ARE ALL LEFT TO CHANCE. IF A LOVE IS TO BE UNFORGETTABLE, FORTUITIES MUST IMMEDIATELY START FLUTTERING DOWN TO IT LIKE BIRDS TO FRANCIS OF ASSISI'S SHOULDERS.


10
HE CALLED HER BACK TO PAY FOR THE COGNAC. HE CLOSED HIS BOOK (THE EMBLEM OF THE SECRET BROTHERHOOD), AND SHE THOUGHT OF ASKING HIM WHAT HE WAS READING.

"CAN YOU HAVE IT CHARGED TO MY ROOM? " HE ASKED.

"YES," SHE SAID. "WHAT NUMBER ARE YOU IN?"

HE SHOWED HER HIS KEY, WHICH WAS ATTACHED TO A PIECE OF WOOD WITH A RED SIX DRAWN ON IT.

"THAT'S ODD," SHE SAID. "SIX."

"WHAT'S SO ODD ABOUT THAT?" HE ASKED.

SHE HAD SUDDENLY RECALLED THAT THE HOUSE WHERE THEY HAD LIVED IN PRAGUE BEFORE HER PARENTS WERE DIVORCED WAS NUMBER SIX. BUT SHE ANSWERED SOMETHING ELSE (WHICH WE MAY CREDIT TO HER WILES): "YOU'RE IN ROOM SIX AND MY SHIFT ENDS AT SIX."

"WELL, MY TRAIN LEAVES AT SEVEN," SAID THE STRANGER.

SHE DID NOT KNOW HOW TO RESPOND, SO SHE GAVE HIM THE BILL FOR HIS SIGNATURE AND TOOK IT OVER TO THE RECEPTION DESK. WHEN SHE FINISHED WORK, THE STRANGER WAS NO LONGER AT HIS TABLE. HAD HE UNDERSTOOD HER DISCREET MESSAGE? SHE LEFT THE RESTAURANT IN A STATE OF EXCITEMENT.

OPPOSITE THE HOTEL WAS A BARREN LITTLE PARK, AS WRETCHED AS ONLY THE PARK OF A DIRTY LITTLE TOWN CAN BE, BUT FOR TEREZA IT HAD ALWAYS BEEN AN ISLAND OF BEAUTY: IT HAD GRASS, FOUR POPLARS, BENCHES, A WEEPING WILLOW, AND A FEW FORSYTHIA BUSHES.

HE WAS SITTING ON A YELLOW BENCH THAT AFFORDED A CLEAR VIEW OF THE RESTAURANT ENTRANCE. THE VERY SAME BENCH SHE HAD SAT ON THE DAY BEFORE WITH A BOOK IN HER LAP! SHE KNEW THEN (THE BIRDS OF FORTUITY HAD BEGUN ALIGHTING ON HER SHOULDERS) THAT THIS STRANGER WAS HER FATE. HE CALLED OUT TO HER, INVITED HER TO SIT NEXT TO HIM. (THE CREW OTHER SOUL RUSHED UP TO THE DECK OTHER BODY.) THEN SHE WALKED HIM TO THE STATION, AND HE GAVE HER HIS CARD AS

50


51

A FAREWELL GESTURE. "IF EVER YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COME TO PRAGUE..."

11
MUCH MORE THAN THE CARD HE SLIPPED HER AT THE LAST MINUTE, IT WAS THE CALL OF ALL THOSE FORTUITIES (THE BOOK, BEETHOVEN, THE NUMBER SIX, THE YELLOW PARK BENCH) WHICH GAVE HER THE COURAGE TO LEAVE HOME AND CHANGE HER FATE. IT MAY WELL BE THOSE FEW FORTUITIES (QUITE MODEST, BY THE WAY, EVEN DRAB, JUST WHAT ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM SO LACKLUSTER A TOWN) WHICH SET HER LOVE IN MOTION AND PROVIDED HER WITH A SOURCE OF ENERGY SHE HAD NOT YET EXHAUSTED AT THE END OF HER DAYS.

OUR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE IS BOMBARDED WITH FORTUITIES OR, TO BE MORE PRECISE, WITH THE ACCIDENTAL MEETINGS OF PEOPLE AND EVENTS WE CALL COINCIDENCES. "CO-INCIDENCE" MEANS THAT TWO EVENTS UNEXPECTEDLY HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME, THEY MEET: TOMAS APPEARS IN THE HOTEL RESTAURANT AT THE SAME TIME THE RADIO IS PLAYING BEETHOVEN. WE DO NOT EVEN NOTICE THE GREAT MAJORITY OF SUCH COINCIDENCES. IF THE SEAT TOMAS OCCUPIED HAD BEEN OCCUPIED INSTEAD BY THE LOCAL BUTCHER, TEREZA NEVER WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT THE RADIO WAS PLAYING BEETHOVEN (THOUGH THE MEETING OF BEETHOVEN AND THE BUTCHER WOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN AN INTERESTING COINCIDENCE). BUT HER NASCENT LOVE INFLAMED HER SENSE OF BEAUTY, AND SHE WOULD NEVER FORGET THAT MUSIC. WHENEVER SHE HEARD IT, SHE WOULD BE TOUCHED. EVERYTHING GOING ON AROUND HER AT THAT MOMENT WOULD BE HALOED BY THE MUSIC AND TAKE ON ITS BEAUTY.


52

EARLY IN THE NOVEL THAT TEREZA CLUTCHED UNDER HER ARM WHEN SHE WENT TO VISIT TOMAS, ANNA MEETS VRONSKY IN CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES: THEY ARE AT THE RAILWAY STATION WHEN SOMEONE IS RUN OVER BY A TRAIN. AT THE END OF THE NOVEL, ANNA THROWS HERSELF UNDER A TRAIN. THIS SYMMETRICAL COMPOSITION—THE SAME MOTIF APPEARS AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END—MAY SEEM QUITE "NOVELISTIC" TO YOU, AND I AM WILLING TO AGREE, BUT ONLY ON CONDITION THAT YOU REFRAIN FROM READING SUCH NOTIONS AS "FICTIVE," "FABRICATED," AND "UNTRUE TO LIFE" INTO THE WORD "NOVELISTIC." BECAUSE HUMAN LIVES ARE COMPOSED IN PRECISELY SUCH A FASHION.

THEY ARE COMPOSED LIKE MUSIC. GUIDED BY HIS SENSE OF BEAUTY, AN INDIVIDUAL TRANSFORMS A FORTUITOUS OCCURRENCE (BEETHOVEN'S MUSIC, DEATH UNDER A TRAIN) INTO A MOTIF, WHICH THEN ASSUMES A PERMANENT PLACE IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE. ANNA COULD HAVE CHOSEN ANOTHER WAY TO TAKE HER LIFE. BUT THE MOTIF OF DEATH AND THE RAILWAY STATION, UNFORGETTABLY BOUND TO THE BIRTH OF LOVE, ENTICED HER IN HER HOUR OF DESPAIR WITH ITS DARK BEAUTY. WITHOUT REALIZING IT, THE INDIVIDUAL COMPOSES HIS LIFE ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF BEAUTY EVEN IN TIMES OF GREATEST DISTRESS.

IT IS WRONG, THEN, TO CHIDE THE NOVEL FOR BEING FASCINATED BY MYSTERIOUS COINCIDENCES (LIKE THE MEETING OF ANNA, VRONSKY, THE RAILWAY STATION, AND DEATH OR THE MEETING OF BEETHOVEN, TOMAS, TEREZA, AND THE COGNAC), BUT IT IS RIGHT TO CHIDE MAN FOR BEING BLIND TO SUCH COINCIDENCES IN HIS DAILY LIFE. FOR HE THEREBY DEPRIVES HIS LIFE OF A DIMENSION OF BEAUTY.


12
IMPELLED BY THE BIRDS OF FORTUITY FLUTTERING DOWN ON HER SHOULDERS, SHE TOOK A WEEK'S LEAVE AND, WITHOUT A WORD TO HER MOTHER, BOARDED THE TRAIN TO PRAGUE. DURING THE JOURNEY, SHE MADE FREQUENT TRIPS TO THE TOILET TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND BEG HER SOUL NOT TO ABANDON THE DECK OF HER BODY FOR A MOMENT ON THIS MOST CRUCIAL DAY OF HER LIFE. SCRUTINIZING HERSELF ON ONE SUCH TRIP, SHE HAD A SUDDEN SCARE: SHE FELT A SCRATCH IN HER THROAT. COULD SHE BE COMING DOWN WITH SOMETHING ON THIS MOST CRUCIAL DAY OF HER LIFE?

BUT THERE WAS NO TURNING BACK. SO SHE PHONED HIM FROM THE STATION, AND THE MOMENT HE OPENED THE DOOR, HER STOMACH STARTED RUMBLING TERRIBLY. SHE WAS MORTIFIED. SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE WERE CARRYING HER MOTHER IN HER STOMACH AND HER MOTHER HAD GUFFAWED TO SPOIL HER MEETING WITH TOMAS.

FOR THE FIRST FEW SECONDS, SHE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD THROW HER OUT BECAUSE OF THE CRUDE NOISES SHE WAS MAKING, BUT THEN HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER. SHE WAS GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR IGNORING HER RUMBLES, AND KISSED HIM PASSIONATELY, HER EYES MISTING. BEFORE THE FIRST MINUTE WAS UP, THEY WERE MAKING LOVE. SHE SCREAMED WHILE MAKING LOVE. SHE HAD A FEVER BY THEN. SHE HAD COME DOWN WITH THE FLU. THE NOZZLE OF THE HOSE SUPPLYING OXYGEN TO THE LUNGS WAS STUFFED AND RED.

WHEN SHE TRAVELED TO PRAGUE A SECOND TIME, IT WAS WITH A HEAVY SUITCASE. SHE HAD PACKED ALL HER THINGS, DETERMINED NEVER AGAIN TO RETURN TO THE SMALL TOWN. HE HAD INVITED HER TO COME TO HIS PLACE THE FOLLOWING EVENING. THAT NIGHT, SHE HAD SLEPT IN A CHEAP HOTEL. IN THE MORNING, SHE CARRIED HER HEAVY SUITCASE TO THE STATION, LEFT IT THERE, AND ROAMED THE STREETS OF PRAGUE THE WHOLE DAY WITH ANNA KARENINA UNDER HER ARM. NOT EVEN AFTER SHE RANG THE DOORBELL AND HE OPENED THE DOOR WOULD SHE PART

53


54

WITH IT. IT WAS LIKE A TICKET INTO TOMAS'S WORLD. SHE REALIZED THAT SHE HAD NOTHING BUT THAT MISERABLE TICKET, AND THE THOUGHT BROUGHT HER NEARLY TO TEARS. TO KEEP FROM CRYING, SHE TALKED TOO MUCH AND TOO LOUDLY, AND SHE LAUGHED. AND AGAIN HE TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS ALMOST AT ONCE AND THEY MADE LOVE. SHE HAD ENTERED A MIST IN WHICH NOTHING COULD BE SEEN AND ONLY HER SCREAM COULD BE HEARD.

13
IT WAS NO SIGH, NO MOAN; IT WAS A REAL SCREAM. SHE SCREAMED SO HARD THAT TOMAS HAD TO TURN HIS HEAD AWAY FROM HER FACE, AFRAID THAT HER VOICE SO CLOSE TO HIS EAR WOULD RUPTURE HIS EARDRUM. THE SCREAM WAS NOT AN EXPRESSION OF SENSUALITY. SENSUALITY IS THE TOTAL MOBILIZATION OF THE SENSES: AN INDIVIDUAL OBSERVES HIS PARTNER INTENTLY, STRAINING TO CATCH EVERY SOUND. BUT HER SCREAM AIMED AT CRIPPLING THE SENSES, PREVENTING ALL SEEING AND HEARING. WHAT WAS SCREAMING IN FACT WAS THE NAIVE IDEALISM OF HER LOVE TRYING TO BANISH ALL CONTRADICTIONS, BANISH THE DUALITY OF BODY AND SOUL, BANISH PERHAPS EVEN TIME.

WERE HER EYES CLOSED? NO, BUT THEY WERE NOT LOOKING ANYWHERE. SHE KEPT THEM FIXED ON THE VOID OF THE CEILING. AT TIMES SHE TWISTED HER HEAD VIOLENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE.

WHEN THE SCREAM DIED DOWN, SHE FELL ASLEEP AT HIS SIDE, CLUTCHING HIS HAND. SHE HELD HIS HAND ALL NIGHT.

EVEN AT THE AGE OF EIGHT SHE WOULD FALL ASLEEP BY PRESSING ONE HAND INTO THE OTHER AND MAKING BELIEVE SHE WAS HOLDING THE HAND OF THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVED, THE MAN OF HER LIFE. SO IF


55

IN HER SLEEP SHE PRESSED TOMAS'S HAND WITH SUCH TENACITY, WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY: SHE HAD BEEN TRAINING FOR IT SINCE CHILDHOOD.

14
A YOUNG WOMAN FORCED TO KEEP DRUNKS SUPPLIED WITH BEER AND SIBLINGS WITH CLEAN UNDERWEAR—INSTEAD OF BEING ALLOWED TO PURSUE "SOMETHING HIGHER"—STORES UP GREAT RESERVES OF VITALITY, A VITALITY NEVER DREAMED OF BY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS YAWNING OVER THEIR BOOKS. TEREZA HAD READ A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN THEY, AND LEARNED A GOOD DEAL MORE ABOUT LIFE, BUT SHE WOULD NEVER REALIZE IT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY GRADUATE AND THE AUTODIDACT LIES NOT SO MUCH IN THE EXTENT OF KNOWLEDGE AS IN THE EXTENT OF VITALITY AND SELF-CONFIDENCE. THE ELAN WITH WHICH TEREZA FLUNG HERSELF INTO HER NEW PRAGUE EXISTENCE WAS BOTH FRENZIED AND PRECARIOUS. SHE SEEMED TO BE EXPECTING SOMEONE TO COME UP TO HER ANY DAY AND SAY, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? GO BACK WHERE YOU BELONG!" ALL HER EAGERNESS FOR LIFE HUNG BY A THREAD: TOMAS'S VOICE. FOR IT WAS TOMAS'S VOICE THAT HAD ONCE COAXED FORTH HER TIMOROUS SOUL FROM ITS HIDING PLACE IN HER BOWELS.

TEREZA HAD A JOB IN A DARKROOM, BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR HER. SHE WANTED TO TAKE PICTURES, NOT DEVELOP THEM. TOMAS'S FRIEND SABINA LENT HER THREE OR FOUR MONOGRAPHS OF FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPHERS, THEN INVITED HER TO A CAFE AND EXPLAINED OVER THE OPEN BOOKS WHAT MADE EACH OF THE PICTURES INTERESTING. TEREZA LISTENED WITH SILENT CONCENTRATION, THE KIND FEW PROFES-


56

SORS EVER GLIMPSE ON THEIR STUDENTS' FACES.

THANKS TO SABINA, SHE CAME TO UNDERSTAND THE TIES BETWEEN PHOTOGRAPHY AND PAINTING, AND SHE MADE TOMAS TAKE HER TO EVERY EXHIBIT THAT OPENED IN PRAGUE. BEFORE LONG, SHE WAS PLACING HER OWN PICTURES IN THE ILLUSTRATED WEEKLY WHERE SHE WORKED, AND FINALLY SHE LEFT THE DARKROOM FOR THE STAFF OF PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS.

ON THE EVENING OF THAT DAY, SHE AND TOMAS WENT OUT TO A BAR WITH FRIENDS TO CELEBRATE HER PROMOTION. EVERYONE DANCED. TOMAS BEGAN TO MOPE. BACK AT HOME, AFTER SOME PRODDING FROM TEREZA, HE ADMITTED THAT HE HAD BEEN JEALOUS WATCHING HER DANCE WITH A COLLEAGUE OF HIS.

"YOU MEAN YOU WERE REALLY JEALOUS?" SHE ASKED HIM TEN TIMES OR MORE, INCREDULOUSLY, AS THOUGH SOMEONE HAD JUST INFORMED HER SHE HAD BEEN AWARDED A NOBEL PRIZE.

THEN SHE PUT HER ARM AROUND HIS WAIST AND BEGAN DANCING ACROSS THE ROOM. THE STEP SHE USED WAS NOT THE ONE SHE HAD SHOWN OFF IN THE BAR. IT WAS MORE LIKE A VILLAGE POLKA, A WILD ROMP THAT SENT HER LEGS FLYING IN THE AIR AND HER TORSO BOUNCING ALL OVER THE ROOM, WITH TOMAS IN TOW.

BEFORE LONG, UNFORTUNATELY, SHE BEGAN TO BE JEALOUS HERSELF, AND TOMAS SAW HER JEALOUSY NOT AS A NOBEL PRIZE, BUT AS A BURDEN, A BURDEN HE WOULD BE SADDLED WITH UNTIL NOT LONG BEFORE HIS DEATH.

TWO YEARS AGO, I KNEW AN OLD WOMAN. SHE WAS SUFFERING FROM AN ILLNESS THAT HAD ALMOST KILLED HER. THE WHOLE OF HER RIGHT SIDE HAD BEEN PARALYZED. ONLY HALF OF HER WAS IN THIS WORLD WHILE THE OTHER WAS ALREADY FOREIGN TO HER. THIS BUSTLING, CHATTERING OLD LADY HAD BEEN REDUCED TO SILENCE AND IMMOBILITY. ALONE DAY AFTER DAY, ILLITERATE, NOT VERY SENSITIVE, HER WHOLE LIFE WAS REDUCED TO GOD. SHE BELIEVED IN HIM. THE PROOF IS THAT SHE HAD A ROSARY, A LEAD STATUE OF CHRIST, AND A STUCCO STATUE OF SAINT JOSEPH CARRYING THE INFANT JESUS. SHE DOUBTED HER ILLNESS WAS INCURABLE, BUT SAID IT WAS SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO HER. FOR EVERYTHING ELSE, SHE RELIED ON THE GOD SHE LOVED SO POORLY.

ONE DAY SOMEONE DID PAY ATTENTION TO HER. A YOUNG MAN. (HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A TRUTH AND ALSO KNEW THAT THIS WOMAN WAS GOING TO DIE, BUT DID NOT WORRY ABOUT SOLVING THIS CONTRADICTION.) HE HAD BECOME GENUINELY INTERESTED IN THE OLD WOMAN’S BOREDOM. SHE FELT IT. AND HIS INTEREST WAS A GODSEND FOR THE INVALID. SHE WAS EAGER TO TALK ABOUT HER TROUBLES: SHE WAS AT THE END OF HER TETHER, AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE WAY FOR THE RISING GENERATION. DID SHE GET BORED? OF COURSE SHE DID. NO ONE SPOKE TO HER. SHE HAD BEEN PUT IN HER CORNER, LIKE A DOG. BETTER TO BE DONE WITH IT ONCE AND FOR ALL. SHE WOULD SOONER DIE THAN BE A BURDEN TO ANYONE.

HER VOICE HAD TAKEN ON A QUARRELSOME NOTE, LIKE SOMEONE HAGGLING OVER A BARGAIN. STILL, THE YOUNG MAN UNDERSTOOD. NONETHELESS, HE THOUGHT BEING A BURDEN ON OTHERS WAS BETTER THAN DYING. WHICH PROVED ONLY ONE THING: THAT HE HAD SURELY NEVER BEEN A BURDEN TO ANY ONE. AND OF COURSE HE TOLD THE OLD LADY—SINCE HE HAD SEEN THE ROSARY: “YOU STILL HAVE GOD.” IT WAS TRUE. BUT EVEN HERE SHE HAD HER TROUBLES. IF SHE HAPPENED TO SPEND RATHER A LONG TIME IN PRAYER, IF HER EYES STRAYED AND FOLLOWED A PATTERN IN THE WALLPAPER, HER DAUGHTER WOULD SAY: “THERE SHE IS, PRAYING AGAIN!” “WHAT BUSINESS IS THAT OF YOURS?” THE INVALID WOULD SAY. “IT’S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT EVENTUALLY IT GETS ON MY NERVES.” AND THE OLD WOMAN WOULD FALL SILENT, CASTING A LONG, REPROACHFUL LOOK AT HER DAUGHTER.

THE YOUNG MAN LISTENED TO ALL THIS WITH AN IMMENSE, UNFAMILIAR PAIN THAT HURT HIS CHEST. AND THE OLD WOMAN WENT ON: “SHE’LL SEE WHEN SHE’S OLD. SHE’LL NEED IT TOO.”

YOU FELT THAT THIS OLD WOMAN HAD BEEN FREED OF EVERYTHING EXCEPT GOD, WHOLLY ABANDONED TO THIS FINAL EVIL, VIRTUOUS THROUGH NECESSITY, TOO EASILY CONVINCED THAT WHAT STILL REMAINED FOR HER WAS THE ONLY THING WORTH LOVING, FINALLY AND IRREVOCABLY PLUNGED INTO THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MAN IN GOD. BUT IF HOPE IN LIFE IS REBORN, GOD IS POWERLESS AGAINST HUMAN INTERESTS.

THEY HAD SAT DOWN AT TABLE. THE YOUNG MAN HAD BEEN INVITED TO DINNER. THE OLD LADY WASN’T EATING, BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO DIGEST IN THE EVENING. SHE HAD STAYED IN HER CORNER, SITTING BEHIND THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN LISTENING TO HER. AND BECAUSE HE FELT HE WAS BEING WATCHED HE COULDN’T EAT VERY MUCH. NEVERTHELESS, THE DINNER PROGRESSED. THEY DECIDED TO EXTEND THE PARTY BY GOING TO THE CINEMA. AS IT HAPPENED, THERE WAS A FUNNY FILM ON THAT WEEK. THE YOUNG MAN HAD BLITHELY ACCEPTED, WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT THE PERSON WHO CONTINUED TO EXIST BEHIND HIS BACK.

THE GUESTS HAD RISEN FROM TABLE TO GO AND WASH THEIR HANDS BEFORE LEAVING. THERE WAS OBVIOUSLY NO QUESTION OF THE OLD LADY’S GOING TOO. EVEN IF SHE HADN’T BEEN HALF-PARALYZED, SHE WAS TOO IGNORANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE FILM. SHE SAID SHE DIDN’T LIKE THE MOVIES. THE TRUTH WAS SHE COULDN’T UNDERSTAND THEM. IN ANY CASE, SHE WAS IN HER CORNER, VACANTLY ABSORBED IN THE BEADS OF HER ROSARY. THIS WAS WHERE SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST. THE THREE OBJECTS SHE KEPT NEAR HER REPRESENTED THE MATERIAL POINT WHERE GOD BEGAN. BEYOND AND BEHIND THE ROSARY, THE STATUE OF CHRIST, OR OF SAINT JOSEPH, OPENED A VAST, DEEP BLACKNESS IN WHICH SHE PLACED ALL HER HOPE.

EVERYONE WAS READY. THEY WENT UP TO THE OLD LADY TO KISS HER AND WISH HER A GOOD NIGHT. SHE HAD ALREADY REALIZED WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WAS CLUTCHING HER ROSARY TIGHTLY IN HER HAND. BUT IT WAS PLAIN THIS SHOWED AS MUCH DESPAIR AS ZEAL. EVERYONE ELSE HAD KISSED HER. ONLY THE YOUNG MAN WAS LEFT. HE HAD GIVEN HER AN AFFECTIONATE HANDSHAKE AND WAS ALREADY TURNING AWAY. BUT SHE SAW THAT THE ONE PERSON WHO HAD TAKEN AN INTEREST IN HER WAS LEAVING. SHE DIDN’T WANT TO BE ALONE. SHE COULD ALREADY FEEL THE HORROR OF LONELINESS, THE LONG, SLEEPLESS HOURS, THE FRUSTRATING INTIMACY WITH GOD. SHE WAS AFRAID, COULD NOW RELY ONLY ON MAN, AND, CLINGING TO THE ONE PERSON WHO HAD SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN HER, HELD ON TO HIS HAND, SQUEEZING IT, CLUMSILY THANKING HIM IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY THIS INSISTENCE. THE YOUNG MAN WAS EMBARRASSED. THE OTHERS WERE ALREADY TURNING ROUND TO TELL HIM TO HURRY UP. THE MOVIE BEGAN AT NINE AND IT WAS BETTER TO ARRIVE EARLY SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE.

HE FELT CONFRONTED BY THE MOST ATROCIOUS SUFFERING HE HAD EVER KNOWN: THAT OF A SICK OLD WOMAN LEFT BEHIND BY PEOPLE GOING TO THE MOVIES. HE WANTED TO LEAVE AND ESCAPE, DIDN’T WANT TO KNOW, TRIED TO DRAW BACK HIS HAND. FOR A MOMENT, HE FELT AN INTENSE HATRED FOR THE OLD WOMAN, AND ALMOST SLAPPED HER HARD ACROSS THE FACE.

FINALLY HE MANAGED TO GET AWAY, WHILE THE INVALID, HALF RISING FROM HER ARMCHAIR, WATCHED WITH HORROR AS THE LAST CERTAINTY IN WHICH SHE COULD HAVE FOUND REST FADED AWAY. NOW THERE WAS NOTHING TO PROTECT HER. AND, DEFENSELESS BEFORE THE IDEA OF DEATH, SHE DID NOT KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TERRIFIED HER, BUT FELT THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE ALONE. GOD WAS OF NO USE TO HER. ALL HE DID WAS CUT HER OFF FROM PEOPLE AND MAKE HER LONELY. SHE DID NOT WANT TO BE WITHOUT PEOPLE. SO SHE BEGAN TO CRY.

THE OTHERS WERE ALREADY OUTSIDE IN THE STREET. THE YOUNG MAN WAS GRIPPED WITH REMORSE. HE LOOKED UP AT THE LIGHTED WINDOW, A GREAT DEAD EYE IN THE SILENT HOUSE. THE EYE CLOSED. THE OLD WOMAN’S DAUGHTER TOLD THE YOUNG MAN: “SHE ALWAYS TURNS THE LIGHT OFF WHEN SHE’S BY HERSELF. SHE LIKES TO SIT IN THE DARK.”1

THE OLD MAN BROUGHT HIS EYEBROWS TRIUMPHANTLY TOGETHER, WAGGLING A SENTENTIOUS FOREFINGER. “WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN,” HE SAID, “MY FATHER USED TO GIVE ME FIVE FRANCS A WEEK OUT OF MY WAGES AS POCKET MONEY TO LAST ME TILL THE FOLLOWING SATURDAY. WELL, I STILL MANAGED TO SAVE. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN I WENT TO SEE MY FIANCÉE, I WALKED FOUR MILES THROUGH THE OPEN COUNTRY TO GET THERE AND FOUR MILES TO GET BACK. JUST YOU LISTEN TO ME NOW, YOUNG MEN JUST DON’T KNOW HOW TO AMUSE THEMSELVES NOWADAYS.” THERE WERE THREE YOUNG MEN SITTING AT A ROUND TABLE WITH THIS ONE OLD MAN. HE WAS DESCRIBING HIS PETTY ADVENTURES—CHILDISH ACTIONS OVERBLOWN, INCIDENTS OF LAZINESS CELEBRATED AS VICTORIES. HE NEVER PAUSED IN HIS STORY, AND, IN A HURRY TO TELL EVERYTHING BEFORE HIS AUDIENCE LEFT, MENTIONED ONLY THOSE PORTIONS OF HIS PAST HE THOUGHT LIKELY TO IMPRESS THEM. MAKING PEOPLE LISTEN WAS HIS ONLY VICE: HE REFUSED TO NOTICE THE IRONY OF THE GLANCES AND THE SUDDEN MOCKERY THAT GREETED HIM. THE YOUNG MAN SAW IN HIM THE USUAL OLD BIRD FOR WHOM EVERYTHING WAS MARVELOUS IN HIS DAY, WHILE HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE RESPECTED ELDER WHOSE EXPERIENCE CARRIES WEIGHT. THE YOUNG DON’T KNOW THAT EXPERIENCE IS A DEFEAT AND THAT WE MUST LOSE EVERYTHING IN ORDER TO WIN A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE. HE HAD SUFFERED. HE NEVER MENTIONED IT. IT’S BETTER TO SEEM HAPPY. AND IF HE WERE WRONG ABOUT THIS, HE WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE MISTAKEN TO TRY TO MAKE PEOPLE SYMPATHIZE WITH HIM. WHAT DO AN OLD MAN’S SUFFERINGS MATTER WHEN LIFE ABSORBS YOU COMPLETELY? HE TALKED ON AND ON, WANDERING BLISSFULLY THROUGH THE GRAYNESS OF HIS MUTTERINGS. BUT IT COULDN’T LAST. HE NEEDED AN ENDING, AND THE ATTENTION OF HIS LISTENERS WAS WANING. HE WASN’T EVEN FUNNY ANY LONGER; HE WAS OLD. AND YOUNG MEN LIKE BILLIARDS AND CARDS, WHICH TAKE THEIR MINDS OFF THE IMBECILITY OF EVERYDAY WORK.

SOON HE WAS ALONE, DESPITE HIS EFFORTS AND THE LIES HE TOLD TO ENLIVEN HIS STORY. WITH NO ATTEMPT TO SPARE HIS FEELINGS, THE YOUNG MEN HAD LEFT. ONCE AGAIN HE WAS ALONE. NO LONGER TO BE LISTENED TO: THAT’S THE TERRIBLE THING ABOUT BEING OLD. HE WAS CONDEMNED TO SILENCE AND LONELINESS. HE WAS BEING TOLD THAT HE WOULD SOON BE DEAD. AND AN OLD MAN WHO IS GOING TO DIE IS USELESS, HE IS EVEN AN INSIDIOUS EMBARRASSMENT. LET HIM GO. HE OUGHT TO GO. OR, IF NOT, TO SHUT UP IS THE LEAST HE CAN DO. HE SUFFERS, BECAUSE AS SOON AS HE STOPS TALKING HE REALIZES THAT HE IS OLD. YET HE DID GET UP AND GO, SMILING TO EVERYONE AROUND HIM. BUT THE FACES HE SAW WERE EITHER INDIFFERENT, OR CONVULSED BY A GAIETY THAT HE HAD NO RIGHT TO SHARE. A MAN WAS LAUGHING: “SHE’S OLD, I DON’T DENY IT, BUT SOMETIMES THE BEST STEWS ARE MADE IN OLD POTS.” ANOTHER, ALREADY MORE SERIOUSLY: “WELL, WE’RE NOT RICH BUT WE EAT WELL. LOOK AT MY GRANDSON NOW, HE EATS MORE THAN HIS FATHER. HIS FATHER NEEDS A POUND OF BREAD, HE NEEDS TWO! AND YOU CAN PILE ON THE SAUSAGE AND CAMEMBERT. AND SOMETIMES WHEN HE’S FINISHED HE SAYS: ‘HAN, HAN!’ AND KEEPS ON EATING.” THE OLD MAN MOVED AWAY. AND WITH HIS SLOW STEP, THE SHORT STEP OF THE DONKEY TURNING THE WHEEL, HE WALKED THROUGH THE CROWDS OF MEN ON THE LONG PAVEMENTS. HE FELT ILL AND DID NOT WANT TO GO HOME. USUALLY HE WAS QUITE HAPPY TO GET HOME TO HIS TABLE AND THE OIL LAMP, THE PLATES WHERE HIS FINGERS MECHANICALLY FOUND THEIR PLACES. HE STILL LIKED TO EAT HIS SUPPER IN SILENCE, THE OLD WOMAN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE, CHEWING OVER EACH MOUTHFUL, WITH AN EMPTY HEAD, EYES FIXED AND DEAD. THIS EVENING, HE WOULD ARRIVE HOME LATER. SUPPER WOULD HAVE BEEN SERVED AND GONE COLD, HIS WIFE WOULD BE IN BED, NOT WORRYING ABOUT HIM SINCE SHE KNEW THAT HE OFTEN CAME HOME UNEXPECTEDLY LATE. SHE WOULD SAY: “HE’S IN THE MOON AGAIN,” AND THAT WOULD BE THAT.

NOW HE WAS WALKING ALONG WITH HIS GENTLY INSISTENT STEP. HE WAS OLD AND ALONE. WHEN A LIFE IS REACHING ITS END, OLD AGE WELLS UP IN WAVES OF NAUSEA. EVERYTHING COMES DOWN TO NOT BEING LISTENED TO ANY MORE. HE WALKS ALONG, TURNS AT THE CORNER OF THE STREET, STUMBLES, AND ALMOST FALLS. I’VE SEEN HIM. IT’S RIDICULOUS, BUT WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT? AFTER ALL, HE PREFERS BEING IN THE STREET, BEING THERE RATHER THAN AT HOME, WHERE FOR HOURS ON END FEVER VEILS THE OLD WOMAN FROM HIM AND ISOLATES HIM IN HIS ROOM. THEN, SOMETIMES, THE DOOR SLOWLY OPENS AND GAPES AJAR FOR A MOMENT. A MAN COMES IN. HE IS WEARING A LIGHT-COLORED SUIT. HE SITS DOWN FACING THE OLD MAN AND THE MINUTES PASS WHILE HE SAYS NOTHING. HE IS MOTIONLESS, JUST LIKE THE DOOR THAT STOOD AJAR A MOMENT AGO. FROM TIME TO TIME HE STROKES HIS HAIR AND SIGHS GENTLY. WHEN HE HAS WATCHED THE OLD MAN FOR A LONG TIME WITH THE SAME HEAVY SADNESS IN HIS EYES, HE LEAVES, SILENTLY. THE LATCH CLICKS BEHIND HIM AND THE OLD MAN REMAINS, HORRIFIED, WITH AN ACID AND PAINFUL FEAR IN HIS STOMACH. OUT IN THE STREET, HOWEVER FEW PEOPLE HE MAY MEET, HE IS NEVER ALONE. HIS FEVER SINGS. HE WALKS A LITTLE FASTER: TOMORROW EVERYTHING WILL BE DIFFERENT, TOMORROW. SUDDENLY HE REALIZES THAT TOMORROW WILL BE THE SAME, AND, AFTER TOMORROW, ALL THE OTHER DAYS. AND HE IS CRUSHED BY THIS IRREPARABLE DISCOVERY. IT’S IDEAS LIKE THIS THAT KILL ONE. MEN KILL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY CANNOT STAND THEM—OR, IF THEY ARE YOUNG, THEY TURN THEM INTO EPIGRAMS.

OLD, MAD, DRUNK, NOBODY KNOWS. HIS WILL BE A WORTHY END, TEAR-STAINED AND ADMIRABLE. HE WILL DIE LOOKING HIS BEST, THAT IS TO SAY, HE WILL SUFFER. THAT WILL BE A CONSOLATION FOR HIM. AND BESIDES, WHERE CAN HE GO? HE WILL ALWAYS BE OLD NOW. MEN BUILD ON THEIR FUTURE OLD AGE. THEY TRY TO GIVE THIS OLD AGE, BESIEGED BY HOPELESSNESS, AN IDLENESS THAT LEAVES THEM WITH NO DEFENSE. THEY WANT TO BECOME FOREMEN SO THEY CAN RETIRE TO A LITTLE HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY. BUT ONCE THEY ARE WELL ON IN YEARS, THEY KNOW VERY WELL THIS IS A MISTAKE. THEY NEED OTHER MEN FOR PROTECTION. AND AS FAR AS HE WAS CONCERNED, HE NEEDED TO BE LISTENED TO IN ORDER TO BELIEVE IN HIS LIFE. THE STREETS WERE DARKER AND EMPTIER NOW. THERE WERE STILL VOICES GOING BY. IN THE STRANGE CALM OF EVENING THEY WERE BECOMING MORE SOLEMN. BEHIND THE HILLS ENCIRCLING THE TOWN THERE WERE STILL GLIMMERS OF DAYLIGHT. FROM SOMEWHERE OUT OF SIGHT, SMOKE ROSE, IMPOSINGLY, BEHIND THE WOODED HILLTOPS. IT ROSE SLOWLY IN THE SKY, IN TIERS, LIKE THE BRANCHES OF A PINE TREE. THE OLD MAN CLOSED HIS EYES. AS LIFE CARRIED AWAY THE RUMBLINGS OF THE TOWN, AND THE HEAVENS SMILED THEIR FOOLISH, INDIFFERENT SMILE, HE WAS ALONE, FORSAKEN, NAKED, ALREADY DEAD.

NEED I DESCRIBE THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS FINE COIN? DOUBTLESS, IN A DARK AND DIRTY ROOM, THE OLD WOMAN WAS LAYING THE TABLE. WHEN DINNER WAS READY SHE SAT DOWN, LOOKED AT THE CLOCK, WAITED A LITTLE LONGER, AND THEN BEGAN TO EAT A HEARTY MEAL. SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF: “HE IS IN THE MOON.” THAT WOULD BE THAT.

THERE WERE FIVE OF THEM LIVING TOGETHER: THE GRANDMOTHER, HER YOUNGER SON, HER ELDER DAUGHTER, AND THE DAUGHTER’S TWO CHILDREN. THE SON WAS ALMOST DUMB; THE DAUGHTER, AN INVALID, COULD THINK ONLY WITH DIFFICULTY; AND OF THE TWO CHILDREN, ONE WAS ALREADY WORKING FOR AN INSURANCE COMPANY WHILE THE OTHER WAS CONTINUING HIS STUDIES. AT SEVENTY, THE GRANDMOTHER STILL DOMINATED ALL THESE PEOPLE. ABOVE HER BED YOU COULD SEE A PORTRAIT TAKEN OF HER FIVE YEARS BEFORE, UPRIGHT IN A BLACK DRESS THAT WAS HELD TOGETHER AT THE NECK BY A MEDALLION, NOT A WRINKLE ON HER FACE. WITH ENORMOUS CLEAR, COLD EYES, SHE HAD A REGAL POSTURE SHE RELINQUISHED ONLY WITH INCREASING AGE, BUT WHICH SHE STILL SOMETIMES TRIED TO RECOVER WHEN SHE WENT OUT.

IT WAS THESE CLEAR EYES THAT HELD A MEMORY FOR HER GRANDSON WHICH STILL MADE HIM BLUSH. THE OLD WOMAN WOULD WAIT UNTIL THERE WERE VISITORS AND WOULD ASK THEN, LOOKING AT HIM SEVERELY, “WHOM DO YOU LIKE BEST? YOUR MOTHER OR YOUR GRANDMOTHER?” THE GAME WAS EVEN BETTER WHEN THE DAUGHTER WAS PRESENT. FOR THE CHILD WOULD ALWAYS REPLY: “MY GRANDMOTHER,” WITH, IN HIS HEART, A GREAT SURGE OF LOVE FOR HIS EVER SILENT MOTHER. THEN, WHEN THE VISITORS WERE SURPRISED AT THIS PREFERENCE, THE MOTHER WOULD SAY: “IT’S BECAUSE SHE’S THE ONE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP.”

IT WAS ALSO BECAUSE THE OLD WOMAN THOUGHT THAT LOVE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DEMAND. THE KNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HERSELF HAD BEEN A GOOD MOTHER GAVE HER A KIND OF RIGIDITY AND INTOLERANCE. SHE HAD NEVER DECEIVED HER HUSBAND, AND HAD BORNE HIM NINE CHILDREN. AFTER HIS DEATH, SHE HAD BROUGHT UP HER FAMILY ENERGETICALLY. LEAVING THEIR LITTLE FARM ON THE OUTSKIRTS, THEY HAD ENDED UP IN THE OLD, POOR PART OF THE TOWN WHERE THEY HAD BEEN LIVING FOR A LONG TIME.

AND CERTAINLY THIS WOMAN WAS NOT LACKING IN QUALITIES. BUT TO HER GRANDSONS, WHO WERE AT THE AGE OF ABSOLUTE JUDGMENTS, SHE WAS NOTHING BUT A FRAUD. ONE OF THEIR UNCLES HAD TOLD THEM A SIGNIFICANT STORY: HE HAD GONE TO PAY A VISIT TO HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW, AND FROM THE OUTSIDE HAD SEEN HER SITTING IDLY AT THE WINDOW. BUT SHE HAD COME TO THE DOOR WITH A DUSTER IN HER HAND AND HAD APOLOGIZED FOR CARRYING ON WORKING BY SAYING THAT SHE HAD SO LITTLE FREE TIME LEFT AFTER DOING HER HOUSEWORK. AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT THIS WAS TYPICAL. SHE FAINTED VERY EASILY AFTER FAMILY DISCUSSIONS. SHE ALSO SUFFERED FROM PAINFUL VOMITING CAUSED BY A LIVER COMPLAINT. BUT SHE SHOWED NOT THE SLIGHTEST DISCRETION IN THE PRACTICE OF HER ILLNESS. FAR FROM SHUTTING HERSELF AWAY, SHE WOULD VOMIT NOISILY INTO THE KITCHEN GARBAGE CAN. AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK INTO THE ROOM, PALE, HER EYES RUNNING WITH TEARS FROM THE EFFORT, SHE WOULD REMIND ANYONE WHO BEGGED HER TO GO TO BED THAT SHE HAD TO GET THE NEXT MEAL READY AND CARRY ON IN RUNNING THE HOUSE: “I DO EVERYTHING HERE.” OR AGAIN: “I DON’T KNOW WHAT WOULD BECOME OF YOU WITHOUT ME.”

THE CHILDREN LEARNED TO IGNORE HER VOMITINGS, HER “ATTACKS” AS SHE CALLED THEM, AS WELL AS HER COMPLAINTS. ONE DAY SHE WENT TO BED AND DEMANDED THE DOCTOR. THEY SENT FOR HIM TO HUMOR HER. ON THE FIRST DAY HE DIAGNOSED A SLIGHT STOMACH UPSET, ON THE SECOND A CANCER OF THE LIVER, ON THE THIRD A SERIOUS ATTACK OF JAUNDICE. BUT THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO CHILDREN INSISTED ON SEEING ALL THIS AS YET ANOTHER PERFORMANCE, A MORE SOPHISTICATED ACT, AND FELT NO CONCERN. THIS WOMAN HAD BULLIED HIM TOO MUCH FOR HIS INITIAL REACTION TO BE PESSIMISTIC. AND THERE IS A KIND OF DESPERATE COURAGE IN BEING LUCID AND REFUSING TO LOVE. BUT PEOPLE WHO PLAY AT BEING ILL CAN SUCCEED: THE GRANDMOTHER CARRIED SIMULATION TO THE POINT OF DEATH. ON HER LAST DAY, HER CHILDREN AROUND HER, SHE BEGAN FREEING HERSELF OF THE FERMENTATIONS IN HER INTESTINES. SHE TURNED AND SPOKE WITH SIMPLICITY TO HER GRANDSON: “YOU SEE,” SHE SAID, “I’M FARTING LIKE A LITTLE PIG.” SHE DIED AN HOUR LATER.

AS FOR HER GRANDSON, HE NOW REALIZED THAT HE HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD A THING THAT WAS HAPPENING. HE COULD NOT FREE HIMSELF OF THE IDEA THAT HE HAD JUST WITNESSED THE LAST AND MOST MONSTROUS OF THIS WOMAN’S PERFORMANCES. AND IF HE ASKED HIMSELF WHETHER HE FELT ANY SORROW, HE COULD FIND NONE AT ALL. ONLY ON THE DAY OF THE FUNERAL, BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL OUTBURST OF TEARS, DID HE WEEP, BUT HE WAS AFRAID OF BEING INSINCERE AND TELLING LIES IN THE PRESENCE OF DEATH. IT WAS ON A FINE WINTER’S DAY, SHOT THROUGH WITH SUNLIGHT. IN THE PALE BLUE SKY, YOU COULD SENSE THE COLD ALL SPANGLED WITH YELLOW. THE CEMETERY OVERLOOKED THE TOWN, AND YOU COULD SEE THE FINE TRANSPARENT SUN SETTING IN THE BAY QUIVERING WITH LIGHT, LIKE A MOIST LIP.

NONE OF THIS FITS TOGETHER? HOW VERY TRUE! A WOMAN YOU LEAVE BEHIND TO GO TO THE MOVIES, AN OLD MAN TO WHOM YOU HAVE STOPPED LISTENING, A DEATH THAT REDEEMS NOTHING, AND THEN, ON THE OTHER HAND, THE WHOLE RADIANCE OF THE WORLD. WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF YOU ACCEPT EVERYTHING? HERE ARE THREE DESTINIES, DIFFERENT AND YET ALIKE. DEATH FOR US ALL, BUT HIS OWN DEATH TO EACH. AFTER ALL, THE SUN STILL WARMS OUR BONES FOR US.

IF IT IS TRUE THAT THE ONLY PARADISES ARE THOSE WE HAVE LOST. I KNOW WHAT NAME TO GIVE THE TENDER AND INHUMAN SOMETHING THAT DWELLS IN ME TODAY. AN EMIGRANT RETURNS TO HIS COUNTRY. AND I REMEMBER. THE IRONY AND TENSION FADE AWAY, AND I AM HOME ONCE MORE. I DON’T WANT TO RUMINATE ON HAPPINESS. IT IS MUCH SIMPLER AND MUCH EASIER THAN THAT. FOR WHAT HAS REMAINED UNTOUCHED IN THESE HOURS I RETRIEVE FROM THE DEPTHS OF FORGETFULNESS IS THE MEMORY OF A PURE EMOTION, A MOMENT SUSPENDED IN ETERNITY. ONLY THIS MEMORY IS TRUE IN ME, AND I ALWAYS DISCOVER IT TOO LATE. WE LOVE THE GENTLENESS OF CERTAIN GESTURES, THE WAY A TREE FITS INTO A LANDSCAPE. AND WE HAVE ONLY ONE DETAIL WITH WHICH TO RECREATE ALL THIS LOVE, BUT IT WILL DO: THE SMELL OF A ROOM TOO LONG SHUT UP, THE SPECIAL SOUND OF A FOOTSTEP ON THE ROAD. THIS IS THE WAY IT IS FOR ME. AND IF I LOVED THEN IN GIVING MYSELF, I FINALLY BECAME MYSELF, SINCE ONLY LOVE RESTORES US.

SLOW, PEACEFUL, AND GRAVE, THESE HOURS RETURN, JUST AS STRONG, JUST AS MOVING—THERE IS A KIND OF VAGUE DESIRE IN THE DULL SKY. EACH REDISCOVERED GESTURE REVEALS ME TO MYSELF. SOMEONE ONCE SAID TO ME: “IT’S SO DIFFICULT TO LIVE.” AND I REMEMBER THE TONE OF VOICE. ON ANOTHER OCCASION, SOMEONE MURMURED: “THE WORST BLUNDER IS STILL TO MAKE PEOPLE SUFFER,” WHEN EVERYTHING IS OVER, THE THIRST FOR LIFE IS GONE. IS THIS WHAT’S CALLED HAPPINESS? AS WE SKIRT ALONG THESE MEMORIES, WE CLOTHE EVERYTHING IN THE SAME QUIET GARB, AND DEATH LOOKS LIKE A BACKDROP WHOSE COLORS HAVE FADED. WE TURN BACK INTO OURSELVES. WE FEEL OUR DISTRESS AND LIKE OURSELVES THE BETTER FOR IT. YES, PERHAPS THAT’S WHAT HAPPINESS IS, THE SELF-PITYING AWARENESS OF OUR UNHAPPINESS.

IT IS CERTAINLY LIKE THAT THIS EVENING. IN THIS MOORISH CAFÉ, AT THE FAR END OF THE ARAB TOWN, I RECALL NOT A MOMENT OF PAST HAPPINESS BUT A FEELING OF STRANGENESS. IT IS ALREADY NIGHT. ON THE WALLS, CANARY-YELLOW LIONS PURSUE GREEN-CLAD SHEIKS AMONG FIVE-BRANCHED PALM TREES. IN A CORNER OF THE CAFÉ, AN ACETYLENE LAMP GIVES A FLICKERING LIGHT. THE REAL LIGHT COMES FROM THE FIRE, AT THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL STOVE ADORNED WITH YELLOW AND GREEN ENAMEL. THE FLAMES FIGHT UP THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, AND I CAN FEEL THEM REFLECTED ON MY FACE. I SIT FACING THE DOORWAY AND THE BAY. CROUCHED IN A CORNER, THE CAFÉ OWNER SEEMS TO BE LOOKING AT MY GLASS, WHICH STANDS THERE EMPTY WITH A MINT LEAF AT THE BOTTOM. THERE IS NO ONE IN THE MAIN ROOM, NOISES RISE FROM THE TOWN OPPOSITE, WHILE FURTHER OFF IN THE BAY LIGHTS SHINE. I HEAR THE ARAB BREATHE HEAVILY, AND HIS EYES GLOW IN THE DUSK. IS THAT THE SOUND OF THE SEA FAR OFF? THE WORLD SIGHS TOWARD ME IN A LONG RHYTHM, AND BRINGS ME THE PEACE AND INDIFFERENCE OF IMMORTAL THINGS. TALL RED SHADOWS MAKE THE LIONS ON THE WALLS SWAY WITH A WAVELIKE MOTION. THE AIR GROWS COOL. A FOGHORN SOUNDS AT SEA. THE BEAMS FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE BEGIN TO TURN: ONE GREEN, ONE RED, AND ONE WHITE. AND STILL THE WORLD SIGHS ITS LONG SIGH. A KIND OF SECRET SONG IS BORN OF THIS INDIFFERENCE. AND I AM HOME AGAIN. I THINK OF A CHILD LIVING IN A POOR DISTRICT. THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, THAT HOUSE! THERE WERE ONLY TWO FLOORS, AND THE STAIRS WERE UNLIT. EVEN NOW, LONG YEARS LATER, HE COULD GO BACK THERE ON THE DARKEST NIGHT. HE KNOWS THAT HE COULD CLIMB THE STAIRS WITHOUT STUMBLING ONCE. HIS VERY BODY IS IMPREGNATED WITH THIS HOUSE. HIS LEGS RETAIN THE EXACT HEIGHT OF THE STEPS; HIS HAND, THE INSTINCTIVE, NEVER-CONQUERED HORROR OF THE BANNISTER. BECAUSE OF THE COCKROACHES.

ON SUMMER EVENINGS, THE WORKINGMEN SIT ON THEIR BALCONIES. IN HIS APARTMENT, THERE WAS ONLY ONE TINY WINDOW. SO THEY WOULD BRING THE CHAIRS DOWN, PUT THEM IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE, AND ENJOY THE EVENING AIR. THERE WAS THE STREET, THE ICE-CREAM VENDOR NEXT DOOR, THE CAFÉS ACROSS THE WAY, AND THE NOISE OF CHILDREN RUNNING FROM DOOR TO DOOR. BUT ABOVE ALL, THROUGH THE WIDE FIG TREES THERE WAS THE SKY. THERE IS A SOLITUDE IN POVERTY, BUT A SOLITUDE THAT GIVES EVERYTHING BACK ITS VALUE. AT A CERTAIN LEVEL OF WEALTH, THE HEAVENS THEMSELVES AND THE STAR-FILLED NIGHT ARE NATURE’S RICHES. BUT SEEN FROM THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE LADDER, THE SKY RECOVERS ITS FULL MEANING: A PRICELESS GRACE. SUMMER NIGHTS MYSTERIOUS WITH CRACKLING STARS! BEHIND THE CHILD WAS A STINKING CORRIDOR, AND HIS LITTLE CHAIR, SPLITTING ACROSS THE BOTTOM, SANK A LITTLE BENEATH HIS WEIGHT. BUT, EYES RAISED, HE DRANK IN THE PURE NIGHT. SOMETIMES A LARGE TRAM WOULD RATTLE SWIFTLY PAST. A DRUNK WOULD STAND SINGING AT A STREET CORNER, WITHOUT DISTURBING THE SILENCE.

THE CHILD’S MOTHER SAT AS SILENTLY. SOMETIMES, PEOPLE WOULD ASK HER: “WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?” AND SHE WOULD ANSWER: “NOTHING.” AND IT WAS QUITE TRUE. EVERYTHING WAS THERE, SO SHE THOUGHT ABOUT NOTHING. HER LIFE, HER INTERESTS, HER CHILDREN WERE SIMPLY THERE, WITH A PRESENCE TOO NATURAL TO BE FELT. SHE WAS FRAIL, HAD DIFFICULTY IN THINKING. SHE HAD A HARSH AND DOMINEERING MOTHER WHO SACRIFICED EVERYTHING TO A TOUCHY ANIMAL PRIDE AND HAD LONG HELD SWAY OVER HER WEAK-MINDED DAUGHTER. EMANCIPATED BY HER MARRIAGE, THE DAUGHTER CAME HOME OBEDIENTLY WHEN HER HUSBAND DIED. HE DIED A SOLDIER’S DEATH, AS THEY SAY. ONE COULD SEE HIS GOLD-FRAMED MILITARY MEDAL AND CROIX DE GUERRE IN A PLACE OF HONOR. THE HOSPITAL SENT THE WIDOW THE SMALL SHELL SPLINTER FOUND IN HIS BODY. SHE KEPT IT. HER GRIEF HAS LONG SINCE DISAPPEARED. SHE HAS FORGOTTEN HER HUSBAND, BUT STILL SPEAKS OF HER CHILDREN’S FATHER. TO SUPPORT THESE CHILDREN, SHE GOES OUT TO WORK AND GIVES HER WAGES TO HER MOTHER, WHO BRINGS THEM UP WITH A WHIP. WHEN SHE HITS THEM TOO HARD, THE DAUGHTER TELLS HER: “DON’T HIT THEM ON THE HEAD.” BECAUSE THEY ARE HER CHILDREN SHE IS VERY FOND OF THEM. SHE LOVES THEM WITH A HIDDEN AND IMPARTIAL LOVE. SOMETIMES, ON THOSE EVENINGS HE’S REMEMBERING, SHE WOULD COME BACK FROM HER EXHAUSTING WORK (AS A CLEANING WOMAN) TO FIND THE HOUSE EMPTY, THE OLD WOMAN OUT SHOPPING, THE CHILDREN STILL AT SCHOOL. SHE WOULD HUDDLE IN A CHAIR, GAZING IN FRONT OF HER, WANDERING OFF IN THE DIZZY PURSUIT OF A CRACK ALONG THE FLOOR. AS THE NIGHT THICKENED AROUND HER, HER MUTENESS WOULD SEEM IRREDEEMABLY DESOLATE. IF THE CHILD CAME IN, HE WOULD SEE HER THIN SHAPE AND BONY SHOULDERS, AND STOP, AFRAID. HE IS BEGINNING TO FEEL A LOT OF THINGS. HE IS SCARCELY AWARE OF HIS OWN EXISTENCE, BUT THIS ANIMAL SILENCE MAKES HIM WANT TO CRY WITH PAIN. HE FEELS SORRY FOR HIS MOTHER; IS THIS THE SAME AS LOVING HER? SHE HAS NEVER HUGGED OR KISSED HIM, FOR SHE WOULDN’T KNOW HOW. HE STANDS A LONG TIME WATCHING HER. FEELING SEPARATE FROM HER, HE BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF HER SUFFERING. SHE DOES NOT HEAR HIM, FOR SHE IS DEAF. IN A FEW MOMENTS, THE OLD WOMAN WILL COME BACK, LIFE WILL START UP AGAIN: THE ROUND LIGHT CAST BY THE KEROSENE LAMP, THE OILCLOTH ON THE TABLE, THE SHOUTING, THE SWEARING. MEANWHILE, THE SILENCE MARKS A PAUSE, AN IMMENSELY LONG MOMENT. VAGUELY AWARE OF THIS, THE CHILD THINKS THE SURGE OF FEELING IN HIM IS LOVE FOR HIS MOTHER. AND IT MUST BE, BECAUSE AFTER ALL SHE IS HIS MOTHER.

SHE IS THINKING OF NOTHING. OUTSIDE, THE LIGHT, THE NOISES; HERE, SILENCE IN THE NIGHT. THE CHILD WILL GROW, WILL LEARN. THEY ARE BRINGING HIM UP AND WILL ASK HIM TO BE GRATEFUL, AS IF THEY WERE SPARING HIM PAIN. HIS MOTHER WILL ALWAYS HAVE THESE SILENCES. HE WILL SUFFER AS HE GROWS. TO BE A MAN IS WHAT COUNTS. HIS GRANDMOTHER WILL DIE, THEN HIS MOTHER, THEN HE.

HIS MOTHER HAS GIVEN A SUDDEN START. SOMETHING HAS FRIGHTENED HER. HE LOOKS STUPID STANDING THERE GAZING AT HER. HE OUGHT TO GO AND DO HIS HOMEWORK. THE CHILD HAS DONE HIS HOMEWORK. TODAY HE IS IN A SORDID CAFÉ. NOW HE IS A MAN. ISN’T THAT WHAT COUNTS? SURELY NOT, SINCE DOING HOMEWORK AND ACCEPTING MANHOOD LEADS TO NOTHING BUT OLD AGE.

STILL CROUCHING IN HIS CORNER, THE ARAB SITS WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED ROUND HIS FEET. THE SCENT OF ROASTING COFFEE RISES FROM THE TERRACES AND MINGLES WITH THE EXCITED CHATTER OF YOUNG VOICES. THE HOOTING OF A TUGBOAT ADDS ITS GRAVE AND TENDER NOTE. THE WORLD IS ENDING HERE AS IT DOES EACH DAY, AND ALL ITS MEASURELESS TORMENTS NOW GIVE RISE TO NOTHING BUT THIS PROMISE OF PEACE. THE INDIFFERENCE OF THIS STRANGE MOTHER! ONLY THE IMMENSE SOLITUDE OF THE WORLD CAN BE THE MEASURE OF IT. ONE EVENING, THEY HAD CALLED HER SON—HE WAS ALREADY QUITE GROWN UP—TO HIS MOTHER’S SIDE. A FRIGHT HAD BROUGHT ON A SERIOUS MENTAL SHOCK. SHE WAS IN THE HABIT OF GOING OUT ON THE BALCONY AT THE END OF THE DAY. SHE WOULD TAKE A CHAIR AND LEAN HER MOUTH AGAINST THE COLD AND SALTY IRON OF THE RAILING. THEN SHE WOULD WATCH THE PEOPLE GOING PAST. BEHIND HER, THE NIGHT WOULD GRADUALLY THICKEN. IN FRONT OF HER, THE SHOPS WOULD SUDDENLY LIGHT UP. THE STREET WOULD FILL WITH PEOPLE AND FIGHTS. SHE WOULD GAZE EMPTILY OUT UNTIL SHE FORGOT WHERE SHE WAS. ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING, A MAN HAD LOOMED UP BEHIND HER, DRAGGED HER BACKWARD, KNOCKED HER ABOUT, AND RUN AWAY WHEN HE HEARD A NOISE. SHE HAD SEEN NOTHING, AND FAINTED. SHE WAS IN BED WHEN HER SON ARRIVED. HE DECIDED, ON THE DOCTOR’S ADVICE, TO SPEND THE NIGHT WITH HER. HE STRETCHED OUT ON THE BED, BY HER SIDE, LYING ON THE TOP OF THE BLANKETS. IT WAS SUMMER. THE FEAR LEFT BY THE RECENT DRAMA HUNG IN THE AIR OF THE OVERHEATED ROOM. FOOTSTEPS WERE RUSTLING AND DOORS CREAKED. THE SMELL OF THE VINEGAR USED TO COOL HIS MOTHER’S BROW FLOATED IN THE HEAVY AIR. SHE MOVED RESTLESSLY ABOUT, WHIMPERING, SOMETIMES GIVING A SUDDEN START, WHICH WOULD SHAKE HIM FROM HIS BRIEF SNATCHES OF SLEEP. HE WOULD WAKE DRENCHED IN SWEAT, READY TO ACT—ONLY TO FALL BACK HEAVILY AFTER GLANCING AT HIS WATCH ON WHICH THE NIGHT LIGHT THREW DANCING SHADOWS. IT WAS ONLY LATER THAT HE REALIZED HOW MUCH THEY HAD BEEN ALONE THAT NIGHT. ALONE AGAINST THE OTHERS. THE “OTHERS” WERE ASLEEP, WHILE THEY BOTH BREATHED THE SAME FEVER. EVERYTHING IN THE OLD HOUSE SEEMED EMPTY. WITH THE LAST MIDNIGHT TRAMS ALL HUMAN HOPE SEEMED DRAINED AWAY, ALL THE CERTAINTIES OF CITY NOISES GONE. THE HOUSE WAS STILL HUMMING WITH THEIR PASSAGE; THEN LITTLE BY LITTLE EVERYTHING DIED AWAY. ALL THAT REMAINED WAS A GREAT GARDEN OF SILENCE INTERRUPTED NOW AND THEN BY THE SICK WOMAN’S FRIGHTENED MOANS. HE HAD NEVER FELT SO LOST. THE WORLD HAD MELTED AWAY, TAKING WITH IT THE ILLUSION THAT LIFE BEGINS AGAIN EACH MORNING. NOTHING WAS LEFT, HIS STUDIES, AMBITIONS, THINGS HE MIGHT CHOOSE IN A RESTAURANT, FAVORITE COLORS. NOTHING BUT THE SICKNESS AND DEATH HE FELT SURROUNDED BY … AND YET, AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THE WORLD WAS CRUMBLING, HE WAS ALIVE. FINALLY HE FELL ASLEEP, BUT NOT WITHOUT TAKING WITH HIM THE TENDER AND DESPAIRING IMAGE OF TWO PEOPLE’S LONELINESS TOGETHER. LATER, MUCH LATER, HE WOULD REMEMBER THIS MINGLED SCENT OF SWEAT AND VINEGAR, THIS MOMENT WHEN HE HAD FELT THE TIES ATTACHING HIM TO HIS MOTHER. AS IF SHE WERE THE IMMENSE PITY HE FELT SPREAD OUT AROUND HIM, MADE FLESH, DILIGENTLY, WITHOUT PRETENSE, PLAYING THE PART OF A POOR OLD WOMAN WHOSE FATE MOVES MEN TO TEARS.

NOW THE ASHES IN THE GRATE ARE BEGINNING TO CHOKE THE FIRE. AND STILL THE SAME SIGH FROM THE EARTH. THE PERFECT SONG OF A DERBOUKA IS HEARD IN THE AIR, A WOMAN’S LAUGHTER ABOVE IT. IN THE BAY, THE FIGHTS COME CLOSER—FISHING VESSELS NO DOUBT, RETURNING TO HARBOR. THE TRIANGLE OF SKY I SEE FROM WHERE I AM SITTING IS STRIPPED OF ITS DAYLIGHT CLOUDS. CHOKED WITH STARS, IT QUIVERS ON A PURE BREEZE AND THE PADDED WINGS OF NIGHT BEAT SLOWLY AROUND ME. HOW FAR WILL IT GO, THIS NIGHT IN WHICH I CEASE TO BELONG TO MYSELF? THERE IS A DANGEROUS VIRTUE IN THE WORD SIMPLICITY. AND TONIGHT I CAN UNDERSTAND A MAN WANTING TO DIE BECAUSE NOTHING MATTERS ANYMORE WHEN ONE SEES THROUGH LIFE COMPLETELY. A MAN SUFFERS AND ENDURES MISFORTUNE AFTER MISFORTUNE. HE BEARS THEM, SETTLES INTO HIS DESTINY. PEOPLE THINK WELL OF HIM. AND THEN, ONE EVENING, HE MEETS A FRIEND HE HAS BEEN VERY FOND OF, WHO SPEAKS TO HIM ABSENT-MINDEDLY. RETURNING HOME, THE MAN KILLS HIMSELF. AFTERWARDS, THERE IS TALK OF PRIVATE SORROWS AND SECRET DRAMAS. NO, IF A REASON REALLY MUST BE FOUND, HE KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE A FRIEND SPOKE TO HIM CARELESSLY. IN THE SAME WAY, EVERY TIME IT SEEMS TO ME THAT I’VE GRASPED THE DEEP MEANING OF THE WORLD, IT IS ITS SIMPLICITY THAT ALWAYS OVERWHELMS ME. MY MOTHER, THAT EVENING, AND ITS STRANGE INDIFFERENCE. ON ANOTHER OCCASION, I WAS LIVING IN A VILLA IN THE SUBURBS, ALONE WITH A DOG, A COUPLE OF CATS AND THEIR KITTENS, ALL BLACK. THE MOTHER CAT COULD NOT FEED THEM. ONE BY ONE, ALL THE KITTENS DIED. THEY FILLED THE ROOM WITH THEIR FILTH. EVERY EVENING, WHEN I ARRIVED HOME, I WOULD FIND ONE LYING STIFF, ITS GUMS LAID BARE. ONE EVENING, I FOUND THE LAST ONE, HALF EATEN BY THE MOTHER. IT STANK ALREADY. THE STENCH OF DEATH MINGLED WITH THE STENCH OF URINE. THEN, WITH MY HANDS IN THE FILTH AND THE STENCH OF ROTTING FLESH REEKING IN MY NOSTRILS, I SAT DOWN IN THE MIDST OF ALL THIS MISERY AND GAZED FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR AT THE DEMENTED GLOW IN THE CAT’S GREEN EYES AS IT CROUCHED MOTIONLESS IN THE CORNER. YES. AND IT IS JUST LIKE THAT THIS EVENING. WHEN WE ARE STRIPPED DOWN TO A CERTAIN POINT, NOTHING LEADS ANYWHERE ANY MORE, HOPE AND DESPAIR ARE EQUALLY GROUNDLESS, AND THE WHOLE OF LIFE CAN BE SUMMED UP IN AN IMAGE. BUT WHY STOP THERE? SIMPLE, EVERYTHING IS SIMPLE, THE FIGHTS ALTERNATING IN THE LIGHTHOUSE, ONE GREEN, ONE RED, ONE WHITE; THE COOL OF THE NIGHT; AND THE SMELL OF THE TOWN AND THE POVERTY THAT REACH ME FROM BELOW. IF, THIS EVENING, THE IMAGE OF A CERTAIN CHILDHOOD COMES BACK TO ME, HOW CAN I KEEP FROM WELCOMING THE LESSON OF LOVE AND POVERTY IT OFFERS? SINCE THIS HOUR IS LIKE A PAUSE BETWEEN YES AND NO, I LEAVE HOPE OR DISGUST WITH LIFE FOR ANOTHER TIME. YES, ONLY TO CAPTURE THE TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLICITY OF PARADISES LOST—IN AN IMAGE. AND SO IT WAS NOT LONG AGO, IN A HOUSE IN AN OLD PART OF TOWN, WHEN A SON WENT TO SEE HIS MOTHER. THEY SAT DOWN FACING EACH OTHER, IN SILENCE. BUT THEIR EYES MET:

“WELL, MOTHER.”

“WELL, HERE WE ARE.”

“ARE YOU BORED? I DON’T TALK MUCH.”

“OH, YOU’VE NEVER TALKED MUCH.”

AND THOUGH HER LIPS DO NOT MOVE HER FACE LIGHTS UP IN A BEAUTIFUL SMILE. IT’S TRUE, HE NEVER TALKED MUCH TO HER. BUT DID HE EVER NEED TO? WHEN ONE KEEPS QUIET, THE SITUATION BECOMES CLEAR. HE IS HER SON, SHE IS HIS MOTHER. SHE CAN SAY TO HIM: “YOU KNOW.”

SHE IS SITTING AT THE FOOT OF THE DIVAN, HER FEET TOGETHER, HER HANDS TOGETHER IN HER LAP. HE, ON HIS CHAIR, SCARCELY LOOKS AT HER AND SMOKES CEASELESSLY. A SILENCE.

“YOU SHOULDN’T SMOKE SO MUCH.”

“I KNOW.”

THE WHOLE FEELING OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD RISES THROUGH THE WINDOW: THE ACCORDION FROM THE CAFÉ NEXT DOOR, THE TRAFFIC HURRYING IN THE EVENING, THE SMELL OF THE SKEWERS OF GRILLED MEAT EATEN BETWEEN SMALL, SPRINGY ROLLS OF BREAD, A CHILD CRYING IN THE ROAD. THE MOTHER RISES AND PICKS UP HER KNITTING. HER FINGERS ARE CLUMSY, TWISTED WITH ARTHRITIS. SHE WORKS SLOWLY, TAKING UP THE SAME STITCH THREE OR FOUR TIMES OR UNDOING A WHOLE ROW WITH A DULL RIPPING SOUND.

“IT’S A LITTLE CARDIGAN. I’LL WEAR IT WITH A WHITE COLLAR. WITH THIS AND MY BLACK COAT, I’LL BE DRESSED FOR THE SEASON.”

SHE HAS RISEN TO TURN ON THE LIGHT.

“IT GETS DARK EARLY THESE DAYS.”

IT WAS TRUE. SUMMER WAS OVER AND AUTUMN HAD NOT YET BEGUN. SWIFTS WERE STILL CALLING IN THE GENTLE SKY.

“WILL YOU COME BACK SOON?”

“BUT I HAVEN’T LEFT YET. WHY DO YOU MENTION THAT?”

“OH, IT WAS JUST TO SAY SOMETHING.”

A TROLLEY GOES BY. A CAR.

“IS IT TRUE I LOOK LIKE MY FATHER?”

“THE SPITTING IMAGE. OF COURSE, YOU DIDN’T KNOW HIM. YOU WERE SIX MONTHS OLD WHEN HE DIED. BUT IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MOUSTACHE!”

HE MENTIONED HIS FATHER WITHOUT CONVICTION. NO MEMORY, NO EMOTION. PROBABLY HE WAS VERY ORDINARY. BESIDES, HE HAD BEEN VERY KEEN TO GO TO WAR. HIS HEAD WAS SPLIT OPEN IN THE BATTLE OF THE MARNE. BLINDED, IT TOOK HIM A WEEK TO DIE; HIS NAME IS LISTED ON THE LOCAL WAR MEMORIAL.

“WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT,” SHE SAYS, “IT WAS BETTER THAT WAY. HE WOULD HAVE COME BACK BLIND OR CRAZY. SO, THE POOR MAN …”

“THAT’S RIGHT.”

WHAT IS IT THEN THAT KEEPS HIM IN THIS ROOM, EXCEPT THE CERTAINTY THAT IT’S STILL THE BEST THING TO DO, THE FEELING THAT THE WHOLE ABSURD SIMPLICITY OF THE WORLD HAS SOUGHT REFUGE HERE.

“WILL YOU BE BACK AGAIN?” SHE SAYS. “I KNOW YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. JUST FROM TIME TO TIME …”

BUT WHERE AM I NOW? AND HOW CAN I SEPARATE THIS DESERTED CAFÉ FROM THAT ROOM IN MY PAST? I DON’T KNOW ANY LONGER WHETHER I’M LIVING OR REMEMBERING. THE BEAMS FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE ARE HERE. AND THE ARAB STANDS IN FRONT OF ME TELLING ME THAT HE IS GOING TO CLOSE. I HAVE TO LEAVE. I NO LONGER WANT TO MAKE SUCH DANGEROUS DESCENTS. IT IS TRUE, AS I TAKE A LAST LOOK AT THE BAY AND ITS LIGHT, THAT WHAT WELLS UP IN ME IS NOT THE HOPE OF BETTER DAYS BUT A SERENE AND PRIMITIVE INDIFFERENCE TO EVERYTHING AND TO MYSELF. BUT I MUST BREAK THIS TOO LIMP AND EASY CURVE. I NEED MY LUCIDITY. YES, EVERYTHING IS SIMPLE. IT’S MEN WHO COMPLICATE THINGS. DON’T LET THEM TELL US ANY STORIES. DON’T LET THEM SAY ABOUT THE MAN CONDEMNED TO DEATH: “HE IS GOING TO PAY HIS DEBT TO SOCIETY,” BUT: “THEY’RE GOING TO CHOP HIS HEAD OFF.” IT MAY SEEM LIKE NOTHING. BUT IT DOES MAKE A LITTLE DIFFERENCE. THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO PREFER TO LOOK THEIR DESTINY STRAIGHT IN THE EYE.

I ARRIVED IN PRAGUE AT SIX IN THE EVENING. RIGHT AWAY, I TOOK MY BAGS TO THE CHECKROOM. I STILL HAD TWO HOURS TO LOOK FOR A HOTEL. AND I WAS FULL OF A STRANGE FEELING OF LIBERTY BECAUSE I NO LONGER HAD TWO SUITCASES HANGING ON MY ARMS. I CAME OUT OF THE STATION, WALKED BY SOME GARDENS, AND SUDDENLY FOUND MYSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AVENUE WENCESLAS, SWARMING WITH PEOPLE AT THAT TIME OF EVENING. AROUND ME WERE A MILLION HUMAN BEINGS WHO HAD BEEN ALIVE ALL THIS TIME WHOSE EXISTENCE HAD NEVER CONCERNED ME. THEY WERE ALIVE. I WAS THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS FROM HOME. I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND THEIR LANGUAGE. THEY WALKED QUICKLY, ALL OF THEM. AND AS THEY OVERTOOK AND PASSED ME, THEY CUT THEMSELVES OFF FROM ME. I FELT LOST.

I HAD LITTLE MONEY. ENOUGH TO LIVE ON FOR SIX DAYS. AFTER THAT, FRIENDS WOULD BE JOINING ME. JUST THE SAME, I BEGAN TO FEEL ANXIOUS. SO I STARTED LOOKING FOR A CHEAP HOTEL. I WAS IN THE NEW PART OF THE TOWN, AND ALL THE PLACES I CAME UPON WERE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS, LAUGHTER, AND WOMEN. I WALKED FASTER. SOMETHING IN MY RAPID PACE ALREADY SEEMED LIKE FLIGHT. TOWARD EIGHT IN THE EVENING, EXHAUSTED, I REACHED THE OLD TOWN. DRAWN BY A MODEST-LOOKING HOTEL WITH A SMALL DOORWAY, I ENTER. I FILL IN THE FORM, TAKE MY KEY. I HAVE ROOM NUMBER 34, ON THE THIRD FLOOR. I OPEN THE DOOR TO FIND MYSELF IN A MOST LUXURIOUS ROOM. I LOOK TO SEE HOW MUCH IT COSTS: TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS I’D THOUGHT. THE MONEY QUESTION IS SUDDENLY ACUTE. NOW I CAN LIVE ONLY SCRIMPINGLY IN THIS GREAT CITY. MY DISTRESS, STILL RATHER VAGUE A FEW MOMENTS AGO, FIXES ITSELF ON THIS ONE POINT. I FEEL UNEASY, HOLLOW AND EMPTY. NEVERTHELESS, A MOMENT OF LUCIDITY: I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN CREDITED, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, WITH THE GREATEST INDIFFERENCE TO MONEY. WHY SHOULD I BE WORRIED? BUT ALREADY MY MIND IS WORKING. I MUST GET SOMETHING TO EAT, I START WALKING AGAIN AND LOOK FOR A CHEAP RESTAURANT. I SHOULD SPEND NO MORE THAN TEN CROWNS ON EACH MEAL. OF ALL THE RESTAURANTS I SEE, THE LEAST EXPENSIVE IS ALSO THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE. I WALK UP AND DOWN IN FRONT OF IT. THE PEOPLE INSIDE BEGIN TO NOTICE MY ANTICS: I HAVE TO GO IN. IT IS A RATHER MURKY CELLAR, PAINTED WITH PRETENTIOUS FRESCOES. THE CLIENTELE IS FAIRLY MIXED. A FEW PROSTITUTES, IN ONE CORNER, ARE SMOKING AND TALKING SERIOUSLY TO ONE ANOTHER. A NUMBER OF MEN, FOR THE MOST PART COLORLESS AND OF INDETERMINATE AGE, SIT EATING AT THE TABLES. THE WAITER, A COLOSSUS IN A GREASY DINNER JACKET, LEANS HIS ENORMOUS, EXPRESSIONLESS HEAD IN MY DIRECTION. I QUICKLY MAKE A RANDOM CHOICE OF A DISH FROM WHAT, FOR ME, IS AN INCOMPREHENSIBLE MENU. BUT IT SEEMS THERE IS NEED FOR EXPLANATIONS. THE WAITER ASKS A QUESTION IN CZECH. I REPLY WITH WHAT LITTLE GERMAN I KNOW. HE DOES NOT KNOW GERMAN. I’M AT A LOSS. HE SUMMONS ONE OF THE GIRLS, WHO COMES FORWARD IN THE CLASSIC POSE, LEFT HAND ON HIP, CIGARETTE IN THE RIGHT, SMILING MOISTLY. SHE SITS DOWN AT MY TABLE AND ASKS QUESTIONS IN A GERMAN I JUDGE AS BAD AS MY OWN. EVERYTHING BECOMES CLEAR. THE WAITER WAS PUSHING THE PLAT DU JOUR. GAME FOR ANYTHING, I ORDER IT. THE GIRL TALKS TO ME BUT I CAN’T UNDERSTAND HER ANYMORE. NATURALLY, I SAY YES IN MY MOST SINCERE TONE OF VOICE. BUT I AM NOT WITH IT. EVERYTHING ANNOYS ME, I HESITATE, I DON’T FEEL HUNGRY. I FEEL A TWINGE OF PAIN AND A TIGHTNESS IN MY STOMACH. I BUY THE GIRL A GLASS OF BEER BECAUSE I KNOW MY MANNERS. THE PLAT DU JOUR HAVING ARRIVED, I START TO EAT: A MIXTURE OF PORRIDGE AND MEAT, RUINED BY AN UNBELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF CUMIN. BUT I THINK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE, OR RATHER OF NOTHING AT ALL, STARING AT THE FAT, LAUGHING MOUTH OF THE WOMAN IN FRONT OF ME. DOES SHE THINK I AM INVITING HER FAVORS? SHE IS ALREADY CLOSE TO ME, STARTS TO MAKE ADVANCES. AN AUTOMATIC GESTURE FROM ME HOLDS HER BACK. (SHE WAS UGLY. I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF SHE HAD BEEN PRETTY I WOULD HAVE AVOIDED EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED LATER.) I WAS AFRAID OF BEING SICK, THEN AND THERE, IN THE MIDST OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE READY TO LAUGH; STILL MORE AFRAID OF BEING ALONE IN MY HOTEL ROOM, WITHOUT MONEY OR ENTHUSIASM, REDUCED TO MYSELF AND MY MISERABLE THOUGHTS. EVEN TODAY, I STILL WONDER WITH EMBARRASSMENT HOW THE WEARY, COWARDLY CREATURE I THEN BECAME COULD HAVE EMERGED FROM ME. I LEFT. I WALKED ABOUT IN THE OLD TOWN, BUT UNABLE TO STOMACH MY OWN COMPANY ANY LONGER, I RAN ALL THE WAY TO MY HOTEL, WENT TO BED, AND WAITED FOR SLEEP, WHICH CAME ALMOST AT ONCE.

ANY COUNTRY WHERE I AM NOT BORED IS A COUNTRY THAT TEACHES ME NOTHING. THAT WAS THE KIND OF REMARK I TRIED OUT TO CHEER MYSELF UP. NEED I DESCRIBE THE DAYS THAT FOLLOWED? I WENT BACK TO MY RESTAURANT. MORNING AND EVENING, I ENDURED THAT ATROCIOUS, SICKENING CUMIN-FLAVORED FOOD. AS A RESULT, I WALKED AROUND ALL DAY WITH A CONSTANT DESIRE TO VOMIT. I RESISTED THE IMPULSE, KNOWING ONE MUST BE FED. BESIDES, WHAT DID THIS MATTER COMPARED TO WHAT I WOULD HAVE HAD TO ENDURE IF I HAD TRIED A NEW RESTAURANT? HERE, AT LEAST, I WAS “RECOGNIZED.” PEOPLE GAVE ME A SMILE EVEN IF THEY DIDN’T SPEAK TO ME. ON THE OTHER HAND, ANGUISH WAS GAINING GROUND. I PAID TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT SHARP TWINGE OF PAIN IN MY HEAD. I DECIDED TO ORGANIZE MY DAYS, TO COVER THEM WITH POINTS OF REFERENCE. I STAYED IN BED AS LATE AS POSSIBLE AND THE DAYS WERE CONSEQUENTLY SHORTER. I WASHED, SHAVED, AND METHODICALLY EXPLORED THE TOWN. I LOST MYSELF IN THE SUMPTUOUS BAROQUE CHURCHES, LOOKING FOR A HOMELAND IN THEM, EMERGING EMPTIER AND MORE DEPRESSED AFTER A DISAPPOINTING CONFRONTATION WITH MYSELF. I WANDERED ALONG THE VLTAVA AND SAW THE WATER SWIRLING AND FOAMING AT ITS DAMS. I SPENT ENDLESS HOURS IN THE IMMENSE, SILENT, AND EMPTY HRADCHIN DISTRICT. AT SUNSET, IN THE SHADOW OF ITS CATHEDRAL AND PALACES, MY LONELY FOOTSTEPS ECHOED IN THE STREETS. HEARING THEM, THE PANIC SEIZED ME AGAIN. I HAD DINNER EARLY AND WENT TO BED AT HALF PAST EIGHT. THE SUN PULLED ME OUT OF MYSELF. I VISITED CHURCHES, PALACES AND MUSEUMS, TRIED TO SOFTEN MY DISTRESS IN EVERY WORK OF ART. A CLASSIC DODGE: I WANTED MY REBELLION TO MELT INTO MELANCHOLY. BUT IN VAIN. AS SOON AS I CAME OUT, I WAS A STRANGER AGAIN. ONCE, HOWEVER, IN A BAROQUE CLOISTER AT THE FAR END OF THE TOWN, THE SOFTNESS OF THE HOUR, THE BELLS TINKLING SLOWLY, THE CLUSTERS OF PIGEONS FLYING FROM THE OLD TOWER, AND SOMETHING LIKE A SCENT OF HERBS AND NOTHINGNESS GAVE RISE WITHIN ME TO A TEAR-FILLED SILENCE THAT ALMOST DELIVERED ME. BACK AT THE HOTEL THAT EVENING, I WROTE THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE IN ONE SITTING: I REPRODUCE IT HERE UNCHANGED, SINCE ITS VERY POMPOSITY REMINDS ME OF HOW COMPLEX MY FEELINGS WERE: “WHAT OTHER PROFIT CAN ONE SEEK TO DRAW FROM TRAVEL? HERE I AM, STRIPPED BARE, IN A TOWN WHERE THE SIGNS ARE STRANGE, UNFAMILIAR HIEROGLYPHICS, WITH NO FRIENDS TO TALK TO, IN SHORT, WITHOUT ANY DISTRACTION. I KNOW VERY WELL THAT NOTHING WILL DELIVER ME FROM THIS ROOM FILLED WITH THE NOISES OF A FOREIGN TOWN, TO LEAD ME TO THE MORE TENDER GLOW OF A FIRESIDE OR A PLACE I’M FOND OF. SHOULD I SHOUT FOR HELP? UNFAMILIAR FACES WOULD APPEAR. CHURCHES, GOLD, INCENSE, EVERYTHING FLINGS ME BACK INTO THIS DAILY LIFE WHERE EVERYTHING TAKES ITS COLOR FROM MY ANGUISH. THE CURTAIN OF HABITS, THE COMFORTABLE LOOM OF WORDS AND GESTURES IN WHICH THE HEART DROWSES, SLOWLY RISES, FINALLY TO REVEAL ANXIETY’S PALLID VISAGE. MAN IS FACE TO FACE WITH HIMSELF: I DEFY HIM TO BE HAPPY … AND YET THIS IS HOW TRAVEL ENLIGHTENS HIM. A GREAT DISCORD OCCURS BETWEEN HIM AND THE THINGS HE SEES. THE MUSIC OF THE WORLD FINDS ITS WAY MORE EASILY INTO THIS HEART GROWN LESS SECURE. FINALLY STRIPPED BARE, THE SLIGHTEST SOLITARY TREE BECOMES THE MOST TENDER AND FRAGILE OF IMAGES. WORKS OF ART AND WOMEN’S SMILES, RACES OF MEN AT HOME IN THEIR LAND AND MONUMENTS THAT SUMMARIZE THE CENTURIES, THIS IS THE MOVING AND PALPABLE LANDSCAPE THAT TRAVEL CONSISTS OF. THEN, AT TWILIGHT, THIS HOTEL ROOM WHERE ONCE AGAIN THE HOLLOW FEELING EATS AT ME, AS IF MY SOUL WERE HUNGRY.” NEED I CONFESS THAT ALL THIS WAS JUST A MEANS OF GETTING TO SLEEP? I CAN ADMIT IT NOW. WHAT I REMEMBER OF PRAGUE IS THE SMELL OF CUCUMBERS SOAKED IN VINEGAR THAT YOU BUY AT ANY STREET CORNER TO EAT BETWEEN YOUR FINGERS. THEIR BITTER, PIQUANT SCENT WOULD AWAKEN MY ANGUISH AND QUICKEN IT AS SOON AS I CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF MY HOTEL. THAT, AND PERHAPS A CERTAIN TUNE PLAYED ON AN ACCORDION AS WELL. BENEATH MY WINDOWS, A BLIND, ONE-ARMED MAN WOULD SIT ON HIS INSTRUMENT, HOLDING IT IN PLACE WITH ONE BUTTOCK WHILE OPENING AND SHUTTING IT WITH HIS GOOD HAND. IT WAS ALWAYS THE SAME CHILDISH, TENDER TUNE THAT WOKE ME EVERY MORNING, ABRUPTLY RETURNING ME TO THE UNADORNED REALITY IN WHICH I WAS FLOUNDERING.

I REMEMBER TOO THAT ON THE BANKS OF THE VLTAVA I WOULD SUDDENLY STOP, AND SEIZED BY THE SCENT OR THE MELODY, CARRIED ALMOST BEYOND MYSELF, WOULD MURMUR: “WHAT DOES IT MEAN? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?” BUT I HAD DOUBTLESS NOT YET GONE OVER THE EDGE. ON THE FOURTH DAY, AT ABOUT TEN IN THE MORNING, I WAS GETTING READY TO GO OUT. I WANTED TO SEE A CERTAIN JEWISH CEMETERY I’D NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE DAY BEFORE. SOMEONE KNOCKED AT THE DOOR OF THE NEXT ROOM. AFTER A MOMENT’S SILENCE, THEY KNOCKED AGAIN. A LONG KNOCK THIS TIME, BUT APPARENTLY THERE WAS NO ANSWER. A HEAVY STEP WENT DOWN THE STAIRS. WITHOUT PAYING ATTENTION TO WHAT I WAS DOING, MY MIND EMPTY, I WASTED A FEW MOMENTS READING THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR A SHAVING CREAM THAT I HAD ALREADY BEEN USING FOR A MONTH. THE DAY WAS HEAVY. A COPPERY LIGHT FELL FROM THE GREY SKY ON THE SPIRES AND DOMES OF OLD PRAGUE. AS THEY DID EVERY MORNING, THE NEWSBOYS WERE CALLING THE NAME OF A NEWSPAPER, NARODNI POLITIKA. I TORE MYSELF WITH DIFFICULTY FROM THE TORPOR THAT WAS OVERCOMING ME. BUT JUST AS I WAS GOING OUT, I PASSED THE BELLMAN WHO LOOKED AFTER MY PARTICULAR FLOOR, ARMED WITH A BUNCH OF KEYS. I STOPPED. HE KNOCKED AGAIN, FOR A LONG TIME. HE TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR. NO SUCCESS. IT MUST HAVE BEEN BOLTED ON THE INSIDE. MORE KNOCKS. THE ROOM SOUNDED SO OMINOUSLY EMPTY THAT, DEPRESSED AS I WAS, I LEFT WITHOUT ASKING ANY QUESTIONS. BUT OUT IN THE PRAGUE STREETS A PAINFUL FOREBODING PURSUED ME. HOW SHALL I EVER FORGET THE BELLMAN’S SILLY FACE, THE FUNNY WAY HIS POLISHED SHOES CURLED UPWARD, THE BUTTON MISSING FROM HIS JACKET? I HAD LUNCH FINALLY, BUT WITH A GROWING FEELING OF DISGUST. AT ABOUT TWO IN THE AFTERNOON, I WENT BACK TO MY HOTEL.

THE STAFF WAS WHISPERING IN THE LOBBY. I CLIMBED THE STAIRS RAPIDLY, THE QUICKER TO FACE WHAT I WAS EXPECTING. IT WAS JUST AS I’D THOUGHT. THE DOOR OF THE ROOM WAS HALF OPEN, SO THAT ALL THAT COULD BE SEEN WAS A HIGH, BLUE-PAINTED WALL. BUT THE DULL LIGHT I MENTIONED EARLIER THREW TWO SHADOWS ON THIS SCREEN: THAT OF THE DEAD MAN LYING ON THE BED AND A POLICEMAN GUARDING THE BODY. THE TWO SHADOWS WERE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER. THE LIGHT OVERWHELMED ME. IT WAS AUTHENTIC, A REAL LIGHT, AN AFTERNOON LIGHT, SIGNIFYING LIFE, THE SORT OF LIGHT THAT MAKES ONE AWARE OF LIVING. HE WAS DEAD. ALONE IN HIS ROOM. I KNEW IT WAS NOT SUICIDE. I DASHED BACK INTO MY ROOM AND THREW MYSELF ON THE BED. A MAN LIKE SO MANY OTHERS, SHORT AND FAT AS FAR AS I COULD TELL FROM HIS SHADOW. HE HAD PROBABLY BEEN DEAD FOR QUITE A WHILE. AND LIFE HAD GONE ON IN THE HOTEL, UNTIL THE BELLMAN HAD THOUGHT OF CALLING HIM. HE HAD COME WITHOUT SUSPECTING ANYTHING AND DIED, ALONE. MEANWHILE, I HAD BEEN READING THE ADVERTISEMENT FOR MY SHAVING CREAM. I SPENT THE AFTERNOON IN A STATE THAT WOULD BE HARD TO DESCRIBE. I LAY ON MY BED, THINKING OF NOTHING, WITH A STRANGE HEAVINESS IN MY HEART. I CUT MY NAILS. I COUNTED THE CRACKS IN THE FLOORBOARDS. “IF I CAN COUNT UP TO A THOUSAND …” AT FIFTY OR SIXTY, I GAVE UP. I COULDN’T GO ON. I COULD UNDERSTAND NOTHING OF THE NOISES OUTSIDE. ONCE, THOUGH, IN THE CORRIDOR, A STIFLED VOICE, A WOMAN’S VOICE, SAID IN GERMAN: “HE WAS SO GOOD.” THEN I THOUGHT DESPERATELY OF HOME, OF MY OWN TOWN ON THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN, OF ITS GENTLE SUMMER EVENINGS THAT I LOVE SO MUCH, SUFFUSED IN GREEN LIGHT AND FILLED WITH YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL WOMEN. IT WAS DAYS SINCE I HAD UTTERED A SINGLE WORD AND MY HEART WAS BURSTING WITH THE CRIES AND PROTESTS I HAD STIFLED. IF ANYONE HAD OPENED HIS ARMS TO ME, I WOULD HAVE WEPT LIKE A CHILD. TOWARD THE END OF THE AFTERNOON, BROKEN WITH WEARINESS, I STARED MADLY AT THE DOOR HANDLE, ENDLESSLY REPEATING A POPULAR ACCORDION TUNE IN MY EMPTY HEAD. AT THAT MOMENT I HAD GONE AS FAR AS I COULD. I HAD NO MORE COUNTRY, CITY, HOTEL ROOM, OR NAME. MADNESS OR VICTORY, HUMILIATION OR INSPIRATION—WAS I ABOUT TO KNOW, OR TO BE DESTROYED? THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR AND MY FRIENDS CAME IN. I WAS SAVED, IF DISAPPOINTED. I BELIEVE I EVEN SAID: “I’M GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.” BUT I’M SURE I STOPPED THERE, AND THAT IN THEIR EYES I STILL LOOKED LIKE THE MAN THEY HAD LEFT.

I LEFT PRAGUE NOT LONG AFTER. AND I CERTAINLY TOOK AN INTEREST IN WHAT I SAW LATER. I COULD NOTE DOWN SUCH AND SUCH AN HOUR IN THE LITTLE GOTHIC CEMETERY OF BAUTZEN, THE BRILLIANT RED OF ITS GERANIUMS AND THE BLUE MORNING SKY. I COULD TALK ABOUT THE LONG, RELENTLESS, BARREN PLAINS OF SILESIA. I CROSSED THEM AT DAYBREAK. A HEAVY FLIGHT OF BIRDS WAS PASSING IN THE THICK, MISTY MORNING, ABOVE THE STICKY EARTH. I ALSO LIKED MORAVIA, TENDER AND GRAVE, WITH ITS DISTANT, PURE HORIZONS, ITS ROADS BORDERED WITH SOUR PLUM TREES. BUT INSIDE I STILL FELT THE DIZZINESS OF THOSE WHO HAVE GAZED TOO LONG INTO A BOTTOMLESS PIT. I ARRIVED IN VIENNA, LEFT A WEEK LATER. STILL THE NUMBNESS HELD ME CAPTIVE.

YET IN THE TRAIN TAKING ME FROM VIENNA TO VENICE, I WAS WAITING FOR SOMETHING. I WAS LIKE A CONVALESCENT FED ON BOUILLON WONDERING HOW HIS FIRST CRUST OF BREAD WILL TASTE. LIGHT WAS ABOUT TO BREAK THROUGH. I KNOW NOW WHAT IT WAS: I WAS READY TO BE HAPPY. I’LL MENTION ONLY THE SIX DAYS I LIVED ON A HILL NEAR VICENZA. I AM STILL THERE, OR RATHER, I STILL FIND MYSELF THERE AGAIN OCCASIONALLY, WHEN THE SCENT OF ROSEMARY BRINGS IT FLOODING BACK.

I ENTER ITALY. A LAND THAT FITS MY SOUL, WHOSE SIGNS I RECOGNIZE ONE BY ONE AS I APPROACH. THE FIRST HOUSES WITH THEIR SCALY TILES, THE FIRST VINES FLAT AGAINST A WALL MADE BLUE BY SULPHUR DRESSINGS, THE FIRST CLOTHES HUNG OUT IN THE COURTYARDS, THE DISORDER OF THE MEN’S UNTIDY, CASUAL DRESS. AND THE FIRST CYPRESS (SO SLIGHT AND YET SO STRAIGHT), THE FIRST OLIVE TREE, THE DUSTY FIG TREE. THE SOUL EXHAUSTS ITS REVOLTS IN THE SHADY PIAZZAS OF SMALL ITALIAN TOWNS, IN NOONTIMES WHEN PIGEONS LOOK FOR SHELTER, IN SLOWNESS AND SLOTH—PASSION MELTS BY DEGREES INTO TEARS, AND THEN, VICENZA. HERE THE DAYS REVOLVE FROM THE DAYBREAK, SWOLLEN WITH ROOSTERS’ CROWING TO THE UNEQUALLED EVENINGS, SWEETISH AND TENDER, SILKY BEHIND THE CYPRESS TREES, THEIR LONG HOURS MEASURED BY THE CRICKETS’ CHIRPING. THE INNER SILENCE THAT ACCOMPANIES ME RISES FROM THE SLOW PACE THAT LEADS FROM EACH OF THESE DAYS TO THE NEXT. WHAT MORE CAN I LONG FOR THAN THIS ROOM OPENING ON THE PLAIN BELOW, WITH ITS ANTIQUE FURNITURE AND ITS HAND-MADE LACE. I HAVE THE WHOLE SKY ON MY FACE AND I FEEL AS IF I COULD FOLLOW THESE SLOW, REVOLVING DAYS FOREVER, SPINNING MOTIONLESSLY WITH THEM. I BREATHE IN THE ONLY HAPPINESS I CAN ATTAIN—AN ATTENTIVE AND FRIENDLY AWARENESS. I SPEND THE WHOLE DAY WALKING ABOUT: FROM THE HILL, I GO DOWN TO VICENZA OR ELSE FURTHER INTO THE COUNTRY. EVERY PERSON I MEET, EVERY SCENT ON THIS STREET IS A PRETEXT FOR MY MEASURELESS LOVE. YOUNG WOMEN LOOKING AFTER A CHILDREN’S SUMMER CAMP, THE ICE-CREAM VENDOR’S HORN (HIS CART IS A GONDOLA ON WHEELS, PUSHED BY TWO HANDLES), THE DISPLAYS OF FRUIT, RED MELONS WITH BLACK PIPS, TRANSLUCENT, STICKY GRAPES—ALL ARE PROPS FOR THE PERSON WHO CAN NO LONGER BE ALONE.2 BUT THE CICADAS’ TENDER AND BITTER CHIRPING, THE PERFUME OF WATER AND STARS ONE MEETS ON SEPTEMBER NIGHTS, THE SCENTED PATHS AMONG THE LENTISKS AND THE ROSEBUSHES, ALL THESE ARE SIGNS OF LOVE FOR THE PERSON FORCED TO BE ALONE.3 THUS PASS THE DAYS. AFTER THE DAZZLING GLARE OF HOURS FILLED WITH SUN, THE EVENINGS COME, IN THE SPLENDID GOLDEN BACKDROP OF THE SUN SETTING BEHIND THE DARKNESS OF THE CYPRESS TREES. I WALK ALONG THE ROAD TOWARD THE CRICKETS ONE HEARS FROM FAR AWAY. AS I ADVANCE, ONE BY ONE THEY BEGIN TO SING MORE CAUTIOUSLY, AND THEN FALL SILENT. I MOVE FORWARD SLOWLY, OPPRESSED BY SO MUCH ARDENT BEAUTY. BEHIND ME, ONE BY ONE, THE CRICKETS’ VOICES SWELL ONCE MORE: A MYSTERY HANGS IN THIS SKY FROM WHICH BEAUTY AND INDIFFERENCE DESCEND. IN A LAST GLEAM OF LIGHT, I READ ON THE FRONT OF A VILLA: “IN MAGNIFICENTIA NATURAE, RESURGIT SPIRITUS.” THIS IS WHERE I SHOULD STOP. ALREADY THE FIRST STAR SHINES, THREE LIGHTS GLEAM ON THE HILL OPPOSITE, NIGHT HAS FALLEN SUDDENLY, UNANNOUNCED. A BREEZE MURMURS IN THE BUSHES BEHIND ME, THE DAY HAS FLED, LEAVING ITS SWEETNESS BEHIND.

I HAD NOT CHANGED, OF COURSE. IT WAS SIMPLY THAT I WAS NO LONGER ALONE. IN PRAGUE, I WAS SUFFOCATING, SURROUNDED BY WALLS. HERE, I WAS FACE TO FACE WITH THE WORLD, AND LIBERATED FROM MYSELF. I PEOPLE THE UNIVERSE WITH FORMS IN MY OWN LIKENESS. FOR I HAVE NOT YET SPOKEN OF THE SUN. JUST AS IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME TO REALIZE MY ATTACHMENT AND LOVE FOR THE WORLD OF POVERTY IN WHICH I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD, ONLY NOW CAN I SEE THE LESSON OF THE SUN AND THE LAND I WAS BORN IN. A LITTLE BEFORE NOON I WENT OUT AND WALKED TOWARD A SPOT I KNEW THAT LOOKED OUT OVER THE IMMENSE PLAIN OF VICENZA. THE SUN HAD ALMOST REACHED ITS ZENITH, THE SKY WAS AN INTENSE, AIRY BLUE. THE LIGHT IT SHED POURED DOWN THE HILLSIDES, CLOTHING CYPRESSES AND OLIVE TREES, WHITE HOUSES AND RED ROOFS IN THE WARMEST OF ROBES, THEN LOSING ITSELF IN THE PLAIN THAT WAS STEAMING IN THE SUN. EACH TIME I HAD THE SAME FEELING OF BEING LAID BARE. THE HORIZONTAL SHADOW OF THAT LITTLE FAT MAN WAS STILL INSIDE ME. AND WHAT I COULD TOUCH WITH MY FINGER IN THESE PLAINS WHIRLING WITH SUNLIGHT AND DUST, IN THESE CLOSE-CROPPED HILLS ALL CRUSTY WITH BURNT GRASS, WAS ONE FORM, STRIPPED TO ITS ESSENTIALS, OF THAT TASTE FOR NOTHINGNESS THAT I CARRIED WITHIN ME. THIS COUNTRY RESTORED MY VERY HEART, AND PUT ME FACE TO FACE WITH MY SECRET ANGUISH. IT WAS AND YET WAS NOT THE ANGUISH I HAD FELT IN PRAGUE. HOW CAN I EXPLAIN IT? CERTAINLY, LOOKING AT THIS ITALIAN PLAIN, PEOPLED WITH TREES, SUNSHINE, I GRASPED BETTER THAN I HAD BEFORE THIS SMELL OF DEATH AND INHUMANITY THAT HAD NOW BEEN PURSUING ME FOR A MONTH. YES, THIS FULLNESS WITHOUT TEARS, THIS PEACE WITHOUT JOY THAT FILLED ME WAS SIMPLY A VERY CLEAR AWARENESS OF WHAT I DID NOT LIKE—RENUNCIATION AND DISINTEREST. IN THE SAME WAY, THE MAN WHO IS ABOUT TO DIE, AND KNOWS IT, TAKES NO INTEREST IN WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO HIS WIFE, EXCEPT IN NOVELS. HE REALIZES MAN’S VOCATION, WHICH IS TO BE SELFISH—THAT IS TO SAY, SOMEONE WHO DESPAIRS. FOR ME, THIS COUNTRY HELD NO PROMISE OF IMMORTALITY. WHAT WOULD BE THE POINT OF FEELING ALIVE ONCE MORE IN THE SOUL, IF I HAD NO EYES TO SEE VICENZA, NO HANDS TO TOUCH THE GRAPES OF VICENZA, NO SKIN TO FEEL THE NIGHT’S CARESS ON THE ROAD FROM MONTE BERICO TO THE VILLA VALMARANA?

YES, ALL THIS WAS TRUE. BUT THE SUN FILLED ME ALSO WITH SOMETHING ELSE THAT I CANNOT REALLY EXPRESS. AT THIS EXTREME POINT OF ACUTE AWARENESS EVERYTHING CAME TOGETHER, AND MY LIFE SEEMED A SOLID BLOCK TO BE ACCEPTED OR REJECTED. I NEEDED A GRANDEUR. I FOUND IT IN THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN MY DEEP DESPAIR AND THE SECRET INDIFFERENCE OF ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD. I DREW FROM IT THE STRENGTH TO BE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME BOTH COURAGEOUS AND AWARE. SO DIFFICULT AND PARADOXICAL A THING WAS ENOUGH FOR ME. BUT PERHAPS I HAVE EXAGGERATED A BIT WHAT I FELT THEN SO SINCERELY. I OFTEN THINK OF PRAGUE AND THE MORTAL DAYS I SPENT THERE. I’M BACK IN MY OWN TOWN AGAIN. OCCASIONALLY, THOUGH, THE SOUR SMELL OF CUCUMBERS AND VINEGAR REAWAKENS MY DISTRESS. THEN I NEED TO THINK OF VICENZA. BOTH ARE DEAR TO ME, AND I FIND IT HARD TO SEPARATE MY LOVE OF FIGHT AND LIFE FROM MY SECRET ATTACHMENT TO THE EXPERIENCE OF DESPAIR THAT I HAVE TRIED TO DESCRIBE. IT WILL BE CLEAR ALREADY THAT I DON’T WANT TO BRING MYSELF TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THEM. IN THE SUBURBS OF ALGIERS, THERE IS A LITTLE CEMETERY WITH BLACK IRON GATES. IF YOU GO THE FAR END, YOU LOOK OUT OVER THE VALLEY WITH THE SEA IN THE DISTANCE. YOU CAN SPEND A LONG TIME DREAMING BEFORE THIS OFFERING THAT SIGHS WITH THE SEA. BUT WHEN YOU RETRACE YOUR STEPS, YOU FIND A SLAB THAT SAYS “ETERNAL REGRETS” ON AN ABANDONED GRAVE. FORTUNATELY, THERE ARE IDEALISTS TO TIDY THINGS UP.

AT NIGHT IN PALMA, LIFE RECEDES SLOWLY TOWARD THE TUNE-FILLED CAFÉ DISTRICT BEHIND THE MARKET: THE STREETS ARE DARK AND SILENT UNTIL ONE COMES UPON LATTICED DOORWAYS WHERE LIGHT AND MUSIC FILTER THROUGH. I SPENT ALMOST A WHOLE NIGHT IN ONE OF THESE CAFÉS. IT WAS A SMALL, VERY LOW ROOM, RECTANGULAR, PAINTED GREEN AND HUNG WITH PINK GARLANDS. THE WOODEN CEILING WAS COVERED WITH TINY RED LIGHT BULBS. MIRACULOUSLY FITTED INTO THIS MINUTE SPACE WERE AN ORCHESTRA, A BAR WITH MULTICOLORED BOTTLES, AND CUSTOMERS SQUEEZED SHOULDER TO SHOULDER SO TIGHT THEY COULD HARDLY BREATHE. JUST MEN. IN THE MIDDLE, TWO SQUARE YARDS OF FREE SPACE. GLASSES AND BOTTLES STREAMED BY AS THE WAITER CARRIED THEM TO ALL FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOM. NO ONE WAS COMPLETELY SOBER. EVERYONE WAS SHOUTING. SOME SORT OF NAVAL OFFICER WAS BELCHING ALCOHOL-LADEN COMPLIMENTS INTO MY FACE. AN AGELESS DWARF AT MY TABLE WAS TELLING ME HIS LIFE STORY. BUT I WAS TOO TENSE TO LISTEN. THE ORCHESTRA WAS PLAYING TUNES ONE COULD ONLY CATCH THE RHYTHM OF, SINCE IT WAS BEATEN OUT BY EVERY FOOT IN THE PLACE. SOMETIMES THE DOOR WOULD OPEN. IN THE MIDST OF SHOUTS, A NEW ARRIVAL WOULD BE FITTED IN BETWEEN TWO CHAIRS.1

SUDDENLY, THE CYMBALS CLASHED, AND A WOMAN LEAPED SWIFTLY INTO THE TINY CIRCLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CABARET. “TWENTY-ONE,” THE OFFICER TOLD ME. I WAS STUPEFIED. THE FACE OF A YOUNG GIRL, BUT CARVED IN A MOUNTAIN OF FLESH. SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SIX FEET TALL. WITH ALL HER FAT SHE MUST HAVE WEIGHED THREE HUNDRED POUNDS. HANDS ON HER HIPS, WEARING A YELLOW NET THROUGH WHICH A CHECKERBOARD OF WHITE FLESH SWELLED, SHE WAS SMILING; AND EACH CORNER OF HER MOUTH SENT A SERIES OF SMALL RIPPLES OF FLESH MOVING TOWARD HER EARS. THE EXCITEMENT IN THE ROOM KNEW NO BOUNDS. ONE FELT THIS GIRL WAS KNOWN, LOVED, EXPECTED. SHE WAS STILL SMILING. SHE LOOKED AROUND AT THE CUSTOMERS, STILL SILENT AND SMILING, AND WIGGLED HER BELLY FORWARD. THE CROWD ROARED, THEN DEMANDED A SONG THAT EVERYONE SEEMED TO KNOW. IT WAS A NASAL ANDALUSIAN TUNE ACCOMPANIED BY A STRONG THREE-BEAT RHYTHM FROM THE DRUMS. SHE SANG, AND AT EACH BEAT MIMED THE ACT OF LOVE WITH HER WHOLE BODY. IN THIS MONOTONOUS AND PASSIONATE MOVEMENT, REAL WAVES OF FLESH ROSE FROM HER HIPS AND MOVED UPWARD UNTIL THEY DIED AWAY ON HER SHOULDERS. THE ROOM SEEMED STUNNED. BUT PIVOTING AROUND WITH THE REFRAIN, SEIZING HER BREASTS WITH BOTH HANDS AND OPENING HER RED, MOIST MOUTH, THE GIRL TOOK UP THE TUNE IN CHORUS WITH THE AUDIENCE, UNTIL EVERYONE STOOD UPRIGHT IN THE TUMULT.

AS SHE STOOD IN THE CENTER, FEET APART, STICKY WITH SWEAT, HAIR HANGING LOOSE, SHE LIFTED HER IMMENSE TORSO, WHICH BURST FORTH FROM ITS YELLOW NETTING. LIKE AN UNCLEAN GODDESS RISING FROM THE WAVES, HER EYES HOLLOW, HER FOREHEAD LOW AND STUPID, ONLY A SLIGHT QUIVERING AT HER KNEES, LIKE A HORSE’S AFTER A RACE, SHOWED SHE WAS STILL LIVING. IN THE MIDST OF THE FOOT-STAMPING JOY AROUND HER, SHE WAS LIKE AN IGNOBLE AND EXALTING IMAGE OF LIFE, WITH DESPAIR IN HER EMPTY EYES AND THICK SWEAT ON HER BELLY …

WITHOUT CAFÉS AND NEWSPAPERS, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO TRAVEL. A PAPER PRINTED IN OUR OWN LANGUAGE, A PLACE TO RUB SHOULDERS WITH OTHERS IN THE EVENINGS ENABLE US TO IMITATE THE FAMILIAR GESTURES OF THE MAN WE WERE AT HOME, WHO, SEEN FROM A DISTANCE, SEEMS SO MUCH A STRANGER. FOR WHAT GIVES VALUE TO TRAVEL IS FEAR. IT BREAKS DOWN A KIND OF INNER STRUCTURE WE HAVE. ONE CAN NO LONGER CHEAT—HIDE BEHIND THE HOURS SPENT AT THE OFFICE OR AT THE PLANT (THOSE HOURS WE PROTEST SO LOUDLY, WHICH PROTECT US SO WELL FROM THE PAIN OF BEING ALONE). I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO WRITE NOVELS IN WHICH MY HEROES WOULD SAY: “WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT THE OFFICE?” OR AGAIN: “MY WIFE HAS DIED, BUT FORTUNATELY I HAVE ALL THESE ORDERS TO FILL FOR TOMORROW.” TRAVEL ROBS US OF SUCH REFUGE. FAR FROM OUR OWN PEOPLE, OUR OWN LANGUAGE, STRIPPED OF ALL OUR PROPS, DEPRIVED OF OUR MASKS (ONE DOESN’T KNOW THE FARE ON THE STREETCARS, OR ANYTHING ELSE), WE ARE COMPLETELY ON THE SURFACE OF OURSELVES. BUT ALSO, SOUL-SICK, WE RESTORE TO EVERY BEING AND EVERY OBJECT ITS MIRACULOUS VALUE. A WOMAN DANCING WITHOUT A THOUGHT IN HER HEAD, A BOTTLE ON A TABLE, GLIMPSED BEHIND A CURTAIN: EACH IMAGE BECOMES A SYMBOL. THE WHOLE OF LIFE SEEMS REFLECTED IN IT, INSOFAR AS IT SUMMARIZES OUR OWN LIFE AT THE MOMENT. WHEN WE ARE AWARE OF EVERY GIFT, THE CONTRADICTORY INTOXICATIONS WE CAN ENJOY (INCLUDING THAT OF LUCIDITY) ARE INDESCRIBABLE. NEVER PERHAPS HAS ANY LAND BUT THE MEDITERRANEAN CARRIED ME SO FAR FROM MYSELF AND YET SO NEAR.

THE EMOTION I FELT AT THE CAFÉ IN PALMA PROBABLY CAME FROM THIS. ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT STRUCK ME IN THE EMPTY DISTRICT NEAR THE CATHEDRAL, AT NOON, AMONG THE OLD PALACES WITH THEIR COOL COURTYARDS, IN THE STREETS WITH THEIR SCENTED SHADOWS, WAS THE IDEA OF A CERTAIN “SLOWNESS.” NO ONE IN THE STREETS. MOTIONLESS OLD WOMEN IN THE MIRADORS. AND, WALKING ALONG PAST THE HOUSES, STOPPING IN COURTYARDS FULL OF GREEN PLANTS AND ROUND, GRAY PILLARS, I MELTED INTO THIS SMELL OF SILENCE, LOSING MY LIMITS, BECOMING NOTHING MORE THAN THE SOUND OF MY FOOTSTEPS OR THE FLIGHT OF BIRDS WHOSE SHADOWS I COULD SEE ON THE STILL SUNLIT PORTION OF THE WALLS. I WOULD ALSO SPEND LONG HOURS IN THE LITTLE GOTHIC CLOISTER OF SAN FRANCISCO. ITS DELICATE, PRECIOUS COLONNADE SHONE WITH THE FINE, GOLDEN YELLOW OF OLD SPANISH MONUMENTS. IN THE COURTYARD THERE WERE ROSE LAURELS, FAKE PEPPER PLANTS, A WROUGHT-IRON WELL FROM WHICH HUNG A LONG, RUSTY METAL SPOON. PASSERS-BY DRANK FROM IT. I STILL REMEMBER SOMETIMES THE CLEAR SOUND IT MADE AS IT DROPPED BACK ON THE STONE OF THE WELL. YET IT WAS NOT THE SWEETNESS OF LIFE THAT THIS CLOISTER TAUGHT ME. IN THE SHARP SOUND OF WINGBEATS AS THE PIGEONS FLEW AWAY, THE SUDDEN, SNUG SILENCE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GARDEN, IN THE LONELY SQUEAKING OF THE CHAIN ON ITS WELL, I FOUND A NEW AND YET FAMILIAR FLAVOR. I WAS LUCID AND SMILING BEFORE THIS UNIQUE PLAY OF APPEARANCES. A SINGLE GESTURE, I FELT, WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SHATTER THIS CRYSTAL IN WHICH THE WORLD’S FACE WAS SMILING. SOMETHING WOULD COME UNDONE—THE FLIGHT OF PIGEONS WOULD DIE AND EACH WOULD SLOWLY TUMBLE ON ITS OUTSTRETCHED WINGS. ONLY MY SILENCE AND IMMOBILITY LENT PLAUSIBILITY TO WHAT LOOKED SO LIKE AN ILLUSION. I JOINED IN THE GAME. I ACCEPTED THE APPEARANCES WITHOUT BEING TAKEN IN. A FINE, GOLDEN SUN GENTLY WARMED THE YELLOW STONES OF THE CLOISTER. A WOMAN WAS DRAWING WATER FROM THE WELL. IN AN HOUR, A MINUTE, A SECOND, NOW PERHAPS, EVERYTHING MIGHT COLLAPSE. AND YET THIS MIRACLE CONTINUED. THE WORLD LIVED ON, MODEST, IRONIC, AND DISCREET (LIKE CERTAIN GENTLE AND RESERVED FORMS OF WOMEN’S FRIENDSHIP). A BALANCE CONTINUED, COLORED, HOWEVER, BY ALL THE APPREHENSION OF ITS OWN END.

THERE LAY ALL MY LOVE OF LIFE: A SILENT PASSION FOR WHAT WOULD PERHAPS ESCAPE ME, A BITTERNESS BENEATH A FLAME. EACH DAY I WOULD LEAVE THIS CLOISTER LIKE A MAN LIFTED FROM HIMSELF, INSCRIBED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT IN THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WORLD. AND I KNOW WHY I THOUGHT THEN OF THE EXPRESSIONLESS EYES OF DORIC APOLLOS OR THE STIFF, MOTIONLESS CHARACTERS IN GIOTTO’S PAINTINGS.2 IT WAS AT THESE MOMENTS THAT I TRULY UNDERSTOOD WHAT COUNTRIES LIKE THIS COULD OFFER ME. I AM SURPRISED MEN CAN AND CERTAINTIES AND RULES FOR LIFE ON THE SHORES OF THE MEDITERRANEAN, THAT THEY CAN SATISFY THEIR REASON THERE AND JUSTIFY OPTIMISM AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY. FOR WHAT STRUCK ME THEN WAS NOT A WORLD MADE TO MAN’S MEASURE, BUT ONE THAT CLOSED IN UPON HIM. IF THE LANGUAGE OF THESE COUNTRIES HARMONIZED WITH WHAT ECHOED DEEPLY WITHIN ME, IT WAS NOT BECAUSE IT ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS BUT BECAUSE IT MADE THEM SUPERFLUOUS. INSTEAD OF PRAYERS OF THANKSGIVING RISING TO MY LIPS, IT WAS THIS NADA WHOSE BIRTH IS POSSIBLE ONLY AT THE SIGHT OF LANDSCAPES CRUSHED BY THE SUN. THERE IS NO LOVE OF LIFE WITHOUT DESPAIR OF LIFE.

IN IBIZA, I SAT EVERY DAY IN THE CAFÉS THAT DOT THE HARBOR. TOWARD FIVE IN THE EVENING, THE YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD STROLL BACK AND FORTH ALONG THE FULL LENGTH OF THE JETTY; THIS IS WHERE MARRIAGES AND THE WHOLE OF LIFE ARE ARRANGED. ONE CANNOT HELP THINKING THERE IS A CERTAIN GRANDEUR IN BEGINNING ONE’S LIFE THIS WAY, WITH THE WHOLE WORLD LOOKING ON. I WOULD SIT DOWN, STILL DIZZY FROM THE DAY’S SUN, MY HEAD FULL OF WHITE CHURCHES AND CHALKY WALLS, DRY FIELDS AND SHAGGY OLIVE TREES. I WOULD DRINK A SWEETISH SYRUP, GAZING AT THE CURVE OF THE HILLS IN FRONT OF ME. THEY SLOPED GENTLY DOWN TO THE SEA. THE EVENING WOULD GROW GREEN. ON THE LARGEST OF THE HILLS, THE LAST BREEZE TURNED THE SAILS OF A WINDMILL. AND, BY A NATURAL MIRACLE, EVERYONE LOWERED HIS VOICE. SOON THERE WAS NOTHING BUT THE SKY AND MUSICAL WORDS RISING TOWARD IT, AS IF HEARD FROM A GREAT DISTANCE. THERE WAS SOMETHING FLEETING AND MELANCHOLY IN THE BRIEF MOMENT OF DUSK, PERCEPTIBLE NOT ONLY TO ONE MAN BUT ALSO TO A WHOLE PEOPLE. AS FOR ME, I LONGED TO LOVE AS PEOPLE LONG TO CRY. I FELT THAT EVERY HOUR I SLEPT NOW WOULD BE AN HOUR STOLEN FROM LIFE … THAT IS TO SAY FROM THOSE HOURS OF UNDEFINED DESIRE. I WAS TENSE AND MOTIONLESS, AS I HAD BEEN DURING THOSE VIBRANT HOURS AT THE CABARET IN PALMA AND AT THE CLOISTER IN SAN FRANCISCO, POWERLESS AGAINST THIS IMMENSE DESIRE TO HOLD THE WORLD BETWEEN MY HANDS.

I KNOW THAT I AM WRONG, THAT WE CANNOT GIVE OURSELVES COMPLETELY. OTHERWISE, WE COULD NOT CREATE. BUT THERE ARE NO LIMITS TO LOVING, AND WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO ME IF I HOLD THINGS BADLY IF I CAN EMBRACE EVERYTHING? THERE ARE WOMEN IN GENOA WHOSE SMILE I LOVED FOR A WHOLE MORNING. I SHALL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN AND CERTAINLY NOTHING IS SIMPLER. BUT WORDS WILL NEVER SMOTHER THE FLAME OF MY REGRET. I WATCHED THE PIGEONS FLYING PAST THE LITTLE WELL AT THE CLOISTER IN SAN FRANCISCO, AND FORGOT MY THIRST. BUT A MOMENT ALWAYS CAME WHEN I WAS THIRSTY AGAIN.
SHE WAS A LONELY AND PECULIAR WOMAN. SHE KEPT IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE SPIRITS, TOOK UP THEIR CAUSES, AND REFUSED TO SEE CERTAIN MEMBERS OF HER FAMILY WHO HAD A BAD REPUTATION IN THIS WORLD WHERE SHE FOUND REFUGE.

ONE DAY, SHE RECEIVED A SMALL LEGACY FROM HER SISTER. THESE FIVE THOUSAND FRANCS, COMING AT THE END OF HER LIFE, TURNED OUT TO BE SOMETHING OF AN ENCUMBRANCE. THEY HAD TO BE INVESTED. IF ALMOST EVERYONE IS CAPABLE OF USING A LARGE FORTUNE, THE DIFFICULTY BEGINS WHEN THE SUM IS A SMALL ONE. THE WOMAN REMAINED TRUE TO HERSELF. NEARING DEATH, SHE WANTED SHELTER FOR HER OLD BONES. A REAL OPPORTUNITY OCCURRED. A LEASE HAD JUST EXPIRED IN THE LOCAL CEMETERY. ON THIS PLOT THE OWNERS HAD ERECTED A MAGNIFICENT, SOBERLY DESIGNED BLACK MARBLE TOMB, A GENUINE TREASURE IN FACT, WHICH THEY WERE PREPARED TO LET HER HAVE FOR FOUR THOUSAND FRANCS. SHE PURCHASED THE VAULT. IT WAS A SAFE INVESTMENT, IMMUNE TO POLITICAL UPHEAVALS OR FLUCTUATIONS IN THE STOCK MARKET. SHE HAD THE INNER GRAVE PREPARED, AND KEPT IT IN READINESS TO RECEIVE HER BODY. AND, WHEN EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED, SHE HAD HER NAME CARVED ON IT IN GOLD LETTERS.

THE TRANSACTION SATISFIED HER SO COMPLETELY THAT SHE WAS SEIZED WITH A VERITABLE LOVE FOR HER TOMB. AT FIRST, SHE WENT TO SEE HOW THE WORK WAS PROGRESSING. SHE ENDED UP BY PAYING HERSELF A VISIT EVERY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. IT WAS THE ONLY TIME SHE WENT OUT, AND IT WAS HER ONLY AMUSEMENT. TOWARD TWO IN THE AFTERNOON, SHE MADE THE LONG TRIP THAT BROUGHT HER TO THE CITY GATES WHERE THE CEMETERY WAS. SHE WOULD GO INTO THE LITTLE TOMB, CAREFULLY CLOSE THE DOOR BEHIND HER, AND KNEEL ON THE PRIE-DIEU. IT WAS THUS, QUITE ALONE WITH HERSELF, CONFRONTING WHAT SHE WAS AND WHAT SHE WOULD BECOME, REDISCOVERING THE LINK IN A CHAIN STILL BROKEN, THAT SHE EFFORTLESSLY PIERCED THE SECRET DESIGNS OF PROVIDENCE. A STRANGE SYMBOL EVEN MADE HER REALIZE ONE DAY THAT IN THE EYES OF THE WORLD SHE WAS DEAD. ON ALL SAINTS’ DAY, ARRIVING LATER THAN USUAL, SHE FOUND THE DOORSTEP OF HER TOMB PIOUSLY STREWN WITH VIOLETS. SOME UNKNOWN AND TENDERHEARTED PASSERS-BY, SEEING THE TOMB DEVOID OF FLOWERS, HAD HAD THE KIND THOUGHT OF SHARING THEIR OWN, AND HONORED HER NEGLECTED MEMORY.

AND NOW I THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS AGAIN. I CAN SEE ONLY THE WALLS OF THE GARDEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF MY WINDOW. AND A FEW BRANCHES FLOWING WITH LIGHT. HIGHER STILL, MORE FOLIAGE AND, HIGHER STILL, THE SUN. BUT ALL I CAN PERCEIVE OF THE AIR REJOICING OUTSIDE, OF ALL THE JOY SPREAD ACROSS THE WORLD, ARE THE SHADOWS OF BRANCHES PLAYING ON MY WHITE CURTAINS. ALSO FIVE RAYS OF SUNLIGHT PATIENTLY POURING THE SCENT OF DRIED GRASS INTO THE ROOM. A BREEZE, AND THE SHADOWS ON THE CURTAINS COME TO LIFE. IF A CLOUD PASSES OVER THE SUN, THE BRIGHT YELLOW OF A VASE OF MIMOSAS LEAPS FROM THE SHADOW. THIS IS ENOUGH: WHEN A SINGLE GLEAM BEGINS, I’M FILLED WITH A CONFUSED AND WHIRLING JOY. IT IS A JANUARY AFTERNOON THAT PUTS ME THIS WAY, FACE TO FACE WITH THE WRONG SIDE OF THE WORLD. BUT THE COLD REMAINS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR. COVERING EVERYTHING A FILM OF SUNLIGHT THAT WOULD CRACK BENEATH YOUR FINGER, BUT WHICH CLOTHES EVERYTHING IN AN ETERNAL SMILE. WHO AM I AND WHAT CAN I DO BUT ENTER INTO THIS PLAY OF FOLIAGE AND LIGHT? BE THIS RAY OF SUNLIGHT IN WHICH MY CIGARETTE BURNS AWAY, THIS SOFTNESS AND DISCREET PASSION BREATHING IN THE AIR. IF I TRY TO REACH MYSELF, IT IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS LIGHT. AND IF I TRY TO UNDERSTAND AND SAVOR THIS DELICATE TASTE WHICH REVEALS THE SECRET OF THE WORLD, IT IS MYSELF THAT I FIND AT THE DEPTH OF THE UNIVERSE. MYSELF, THAT IS TO SAY, THIS EXTREME EMOTION WHICH FREES ME FROM MY SURROUNDINGS.

IN A MOMENT—OTHER THINGS, OTHER MEN, AND THE GRAVES THEY PURCHASE. BUT LET ME CUT THIS MINUTE FROM THE CLOTH OF TIME. OTHERS LEAVE A FLOWER BETWEEN PAGES, ENCLOSING IN THEM A WALK WHERE LOVE HAS TOUCHED THEM WITH ITS WING. I WALK TOO, BUT AM CARESSED BY A GOD. LIFE IS SHORT, AND IT IS SINFUL TO WASTE ONE’S TIME. THEY SAY I’M ACTIVE. BUT BEING ACTIVE IS STILL WASTING ONE’S TIME, IF IN DOING ONE LOSES ONESELF. TODAY IS A RESTING TIME, AND MY HEART GOES OFF IN SEARCH OF ITSELF. IF AN ANGUISH STILL CLUTCHES ME, IT’S WHEN I FEEL THIS IMPALPABLE MOMENT SLIP THROUGH MY FINGERS LIKE QUICKSILVER. LET THOSE WHO WISH TO TURN THEIR BACKS UPON THE WORLD. I HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF, SINCE I CAN SEE MYSELF BEING BORN. AT THE MOMENT, MY WHOLE KINGDOM IS OF THIS WORLD. THIS SUN AND THESE SHADOWS, THIS WARMTH AND THIS COLD RISING FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE AIR: WHY WONDER IF SOMETHING IS DYING OR IF MEN SUFFER, SINCE EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN ON THIS WINDOW WHERE THE SUN SHEDS ITS PLENTY AS A GREETING TO MY PITY? I CAN SAY AND IN A MOMENT I SHALL SAY THAT WHAT COUNTS IS TO BE HUMAN AND SIMPLE. NO, WHAT COUNTS IS TO BE TRUE, AND THEN EVERYTHING FITS IN, HUMANITY AND SIMPLICITY. WHEN AM I TRUER THAN WHEN I AM THE WORLD? MY CUP BRIMS OVER BEFORE I HAVE TIME TO DESIRE. ETERNITY IS THERE AND I WAS HOPING FOR IT. WHAT I WISH FOR NOW IS NO LONGER HAPPINESS BUT SIMPLY AWARENESS.

ONE MAN CONTEMPLATES AND ANOTHER DIGS HIS GRAVE: HOW CAN WE SEPARATE THEM? MEN AND THEIR ABSURDITY? BUT HERE IS THE SMILE OF THE HEAVENS. THE LIGHT SWELLS AND SOON IT WILL BE SUMMER. BUT HERE ARE THE EYES AND VOICES OF THOSE I MUST LOVE. I HOLD ONTO THE WORLD WITH EVERY GESTURE, TO MEN WITH ALL MY GRATITUDE AND PITY. I DO NOT WANT TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND WRONG SIDES OF THE WORLD, AND I DO NOT LIKE A CHOICE TO BE MADE. PEOPLE DON’T WANT ONE TO BE LUCID AND IRONIC. THEY SAY: “IT SHOWS YOU’RE NOT NICE.” I CAN’T SEE HOW THIS FOLLOWS. CERTAINLY, IF I HEAR SOMEONE CALLED AN IMMORALIST, MY TRANSLATION IS THAT HE NEEDS TO GIVE HIMSELF AN ETHIC; IF I HEAR OF ANOTHER THAT HE DESPISES INTELLIGENCE, I REALIZE THAT HE CANNOT BEAR HIS DOUBTS. BUT THIS IS BECAUSE I DON’T LIKE PEOPLE TO CHEAT. THE GREAT COURAGE IS STILL TO GAZE AS SQUARELY AT THE LIGHT AS AT DEATH. BESIDES, HOW CAN I DEFINE THE LINK THAT LEADS FROM THIS ALL-CONSUMING LOVE OF LIFE TO THIS SECRET DESPAIR? IF I LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF IRONY,3 CROUCHING UNDERNEATH THINGS, SLOWLY IT REVEALS ITSELF. WINKING ITS SMALL, CLEAR EYE, IT SAYS: “LIVE AS IF …” IN SPITE OF MUCH SEARCHING, THIS IS ALL I KNOW.

AFTER ALL, I AM NOT SURE THAT I AM RIGHT. BUT IF I THINK OF THAT WOMAN WHOSE STORY I HEARD, THIS IS NOT WHAT IS IMPORTANT. SHE WAS GOING TO DIE, AND HER DAUGHTER DRESSED HER FOR THE TOMB WHILE SHE WAS ALIVE. ACTUALLY, IT SEEMS IT’S EASIER TO DO SO BEFORE THE LIMBS ARE STIFF. YET IT’S ODD ALL THE SAME TO LIVE AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUCH A HURRY.

IN THE SPRING, TIPASA IS INHABITED BY GODS AND THE GODS SPEAK IN THE SUN AND THE SCENT OF ABSINTHE LEAVES, IN THE SILVER ARMOR OF THE SEA, IN THE RAW BLUE SKY, THE FLOWER-COVERED RUINS, AND THE GREAT BUBBLES OF LIGHT AMONG THE HEAPS OF STONE. AT CERTAIN HOURS OF THE DAY THE COUNTRYSIDE IS BLACK WITH SUNLIGHT. THE EYES TRY IN VAIN TO PERCEIVE ANYTHING BUT DROPS OF LIGHT AND COLORS TREMBLING ON THE LASHES. THE THICK SCENT OF AROMATIC PLANTS TEARS AT THE THROAT AND SUFFOCATES IN THE VAST HEAT. FAR AWAY, I CAN JUST MAKE OUT THE BLACK BULK OF THE CHENOUA, ROOTED IN THE HILLS AROUND THE VILLAGE, MOVING WITH A SLOW AND HEAVY RHYTHM UNTIL FINALLY IT CROUCHES IN THE SEA.

THE VILLAGE WE PASS THROUGH TO GET THERE ALREADY OPENS ON THE BAY. WE ENTER A BLUE AND YELLOW WORLD AND ARE WELCOMED BY THE PUNGENT, ODOROUS SIGH OF THE ALGERIAN SUMMER EARTH. EVERYWHERE, PINKISH BOUGAINVILLAEA HANGS OVER VILLA WALLS; IN THE GARDENS THE HIBISCUS ARE STILL PALE RED, AND THERE IS A PROFUSION OF TEA ROSES THICK AS CREAM, WITH DELICATE BORDERS OF LONG, BLUE IRIS. ALL THE STONES ARE WARM. AS WE STEP OFF THE BUTTERCUP YELLOW BUS, BUTCHERS IN THEIR LITTLE RED TRUCKS ARE MAKING THEIR MORNING ROUNDS, CALLING TO THE VILLAGERS WITH THEIR HORNS.

TO THE LEFT OF THE PORT, A DRY STONE STAIRWAY LEADS TO THE RUINS, THROUGH THE MASTIC TREES AND BROOM. THE PATH GOES BY A SMALL LIGHTHOUSE BEFORE PLUNGING INTO THE OPEN COUNTRY. ALREADY, AT THE FOOT OF THIS LIGHTHOUSE, LARGE RED, YELLOW, AND VIOLET PLANTS DESCEND TOWARD THE FIRST ROCKS, SUCKED AT BY THE SEA WITH A KISSING SOUND. AS WE STAND IN THE SLIGHT BREEZE, WITH THE SUN WARMING ONE SIDE OF OUR FACES, WE WATCH THE FIGHT COMING DOWN FROM THE SKY, THE SMOOTH SEA AND THE SMILE OF ITS GLITTERING TEETH. WE ARE SPECTATORS FOR THE LAST TIME BEFORE WE ENTER THE KINGDOM OF RUINS.

AFTER A FEW STEPS, THE SMELL OF ABSINTHE SEIZES ONE BY THE THROAT. THE WORMWOOD’S GRAY WOOL COVERS THE RUINS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE. ITS OIL FERMENTS IN THE HEAT, AND THE WHOLE EARTH GIVES OFF A HEADY ALCOHOL THAT MAKES THE SKY FLICKER. WE WALK TOWARD AN ENCOUNTER WITH LOVE AND DESIRE. WE ARE NOT SEEKING LESSONS OR THE BITTER PHILOSOPHY ONE REQUIRES OF GREATNESS. EVERYTHING SEEMS FUTILE HERE EXCEPT THE SUN, OUR KISSES, AND THE WILD SCENTS OF THE EARTH. I DO NOT SEEK SOLITUDE. I HAVE OFTEN BEEN HERE WITH THOSE I LOVED AND READ ON THEIR FEATURES THE CLEAR SMILE THE FACE OF LOVE ASSUMES. HERE, I LEAVE ORDER AND MODERATION TO OTHERS. THE GREAT FREE LOVE OF NATURE AND THE SEA ABSORBS ME COMPLETELY. IN THIS MARRIAGE OF RUINS AND SPRINGTIME, THE RUINS HAVE BECOME STONES AGAIN, AND LOSING THE POLISH IMPOSED ON THEM BY MEN, THEY HAVE REVERTED TO NATURE. TO CELEBRATE THE RETURN OF HER PRODIGAL DAUGHTERS NATURE HAS LAID OUT A PROFUSION OF FLOWERS. THE HELIOTROPE PUSHES ITS RED AND WHITE HEAD BETWEEN THE FLAGSTONES OF THE FORUM, RED GERANIUMS SPILL THEIR BLOOD OVER WHAT WERE HOUSES, TEMPLES, AND PUBLIC SQUARES. LIKE THE MEN WHOM MUCH KNOWLEDGE BRINGS BACK TO GOD, MANY YEARS HAVE BROUGHT THESE RUINS BACK TO THEIR MOTHER’S HOUSE. TODAY, THEIR PAST HAS FINALLY LEFT THEM, AND NOTHING DISTRACTS THEM FROM THE DEEP FORCE PULLING THEM BACK TO THE CENTER OF ALL THAT FALLS.

HOW MANY HOURS HAVE I SPENT CRUSHING ABSINTHE LEAVES, CARESSING RUINS, TRYING TO MATCH MY BREATHING WITH THE WORLD’S TUMULTUOUS SIGHS! DEEP AMONG WILD SCENTS AND CONCERTS OF SOMNOLENT INSECTS, I OPEN MY EYES AND HEART TO THE UNBEARABLE GRANDEUR OF THIS HEAT-SOAKED SKY. IT IS NOT SO EASY TO BECOME WHAT ONE IS, TO REDISCOVER ONE’S DEEPEST MEASURE. BUT WATCHING THE SOLID BACKBONE OF THE CHENOUA, MY HEART WOULD GROW CALM WITH A STRANGE CERTAINTY. I WAS LEARNING TO BREATHE, I WAS FITTING INTO THINGS AND FULFILLING MYSELF. AS I CLIMBED ONE AFTER ANOTHER OF THE HILLS, EACH BROUGHT A REWARD, LIKE THE TEMPLE WHOSE COLUMNS MEASURE THE COURSE OF THE SUN AND FROM WHICH ONE CAN SEE THE WHOLE VILLAGE, ITS WHITE AND PINK WALLS AND GREEN VERANDAS. LIKE THE BASILICA ON THE EAST HILL TOO, WHICH STILL HAS ITS WALLS AND IS SURROUNDED BY A GREAT CIRCLE OF UNCOVERED ORNAMENTED COFFINS, MOST OF THEM SCARCELY OUT OF THE EARTH, WHOSE NATURE THEY STILL SHARE. THEY USED TO CONTAIN CORPSES; NOW SAGE AND WALLFLOWERS GROW IN THEM. THE SAINTE-SALSA BASILICA IS CHRISTIAN, BUT EACH TIME WE LOOK OUT THROUGH A GAP IN THE WALLS WE ARE GREETED BY THE SONG OF THE WORLD: HILLSIDES PLANTED WITH PINE AND CYPRESS TREES, OR THE SEA ROLLING ITS WHITE HORSES TWENTY YARDS AWAY. THE HILL ON WHICH SAINTE-SALSA IS BUILT HAS A FLAT TOP AND THE WIND BLOWS MORE STRONGLY THROUGH THE PORTALS. UNDER THE MORNING SUN, A GREAT HAPPINESS HOVERS IN SPACE.

THOSE WHO NEED MYTHS ARE INDEED POOR. HERE THE GODS SERVE AS BEDS OR RESTING PLACES AS THE DAY RACES ACROSS THE SKY. I DESCRIBE AND SAY: “THIS IS RED, THIS BLUE, THIS GREEN. THIS IS THE SEA, THE MOUNTAIN, THE FLOWERS.” NEED I MENTION DIONYSUS TO SAY THAT I LOVE TO CRUSH MASTIC BULBS UNDER MY NOSE? IS THE OLD HYMN THAT WILL LATER COME TO ME QUITE SPONTANEOUSLY EVEN ADDRESSED TO DEMETER: “HAPPY IS HE ALIVE WHO HAS SEEN THESE THINGS ON EARTH”? HOW CAN WE FORGET THE LESSON OF SIGHT AND SEEING ON THIS EARTH? ALL MEN HAD TO DO AT THE MYSTERIES OF ELEUSIS WAS WATCH. YET EVEN HERE, I KNOW THAT I SHALL NEVER COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE WORLD. I MUST BE NAKED AND DIVE INTO THE SEA, STILL SCENTED WITH THE PERFUMES OF THE EARTH, WASH THEM OFF IN THE SEA, AND CONSUMMATE WITH MY FLESH THE EMBRACE FOR WHICH SUN AND SEA, LIPS TO LIPS, HAVE SO LONG BEEN SIGHING. I FEEL THE SHOCK OF THE WATER, RISE UP THROUGH A THICK, COLD GLUE, THEN DIVE BACK WITH MY EARS RINGING, MY NOSE STREAMING, AND THE TASTE OF SALT IN MY MOUTH. AS I SWIM, MY ARMS SHINING WITH WATER FLASH INTO GOLD IN THE SUNLIGHT, UNTIL I FOLD THEM IN AGAIN WITH A TWIST OF ALL MY MUSCLES; THE WATER STREAMS ALONG MY BODY AS MY LEGS TAKE TUMULTUOUS POSSESSION OF THE WAVES—AND THE HORIZON DISAPPEARS. ON THE BEACH, I FLOP DOWN ON THE SAND, YIELD TO THE WORLD, FEEL THE WEIGHT OF FLESH AND BONES, AGAIN DAZED WITH SUNLIGHT, OCCASIONALLY GLANCING AT MY ARMS WHERE THE WATER SLIDES OFF AND PATCHES OF SALT AND SOFT BLOND HAIR APPEAR ON MY SKIN.

HERE I UNDERSTAND WHAT IS MEANT BY GLORY: THE RIGHT TO LOVE WITHOUT LIMITS. THERE IS ONLY ONE LOVE IN THIS WORLD. TO CLASP A WOMAN’S BODY IS ALSO TO HOLD IN ONE’S ARMS THIS STRANGE JOY THAT DESCENDS FROM SKY TO SEA. IN A MOMENT, WHEN I THROW MYSELF DOWN AMONG THE ABSINTHE PLANTS TO BRING THEIR SCENT INTO MY BODY. I SHALL KNOW, APPEARANCES TO THE CONTRARY, THAT I AM FULFILLING A TRUTH WHICH IS THE SUN’S AND WHICH WILL ALSO BE MY DEATH’S. IN A SENSE, IT IS INDEED MY LIFE THAT I AM STAKING HERE, A LIFE THAT TASTES OF WARM STONE, THAT IS FULL OF THE SIGHS OF THE SEA AND THE RISING SONG OF THE CRICKETS. THE BREEZE IS COOL AND THE SKY BLUE. I LOVE THIS LIFE WITH ABANDON AND WISH TO SPEAK OF IT BOLDLY: IT MAKES ME PROUD OF MY HUMAN CONDITION. YET PEOPLE HAVE OFTEN TOLD ME: THERE’S NOTHING TO BE PROUD OF. YES, THERE IS: THIS SUN, THIS SEA, MY HEART LEAPING WITH YOUTH, THE SALT TASTE OF MY BODY AND THIS VAST LANDSCAPE IN WHICH TENDERNESS AND GLORY MERGE IN BLUE AND YELLOW. IT IS TO CONQUER THIS THAT I NEED MY STRENGTH AND MY RESOURCES. EVERYTHING HERE LEAVES ME INTACT, I SURRENDER NOTHING OF MYSELF, AND DON NO MASK: LEARNING PATIENTLY AND ARDUOUSLY HOW TO LIVE IS ENOUGH FOR ME, WELL WORTH ALL THEIR ARTS OF LIVING.

SHORTLY BEFORE NOON, WE WOULD COME BACK THROUGH THE RUINS TO A LITTLE CAFÉ BY THE SIDE OF THE PORT. HOW COOL WAS THE WELCOME OF A TALL GLASS OF ICED GREEN MINT IN THE SHADY ROOM, TO HEADS RINGING WITH COLORS AND THE CYMBALS OF THE SUN! OUTSIDE WERE THE SEA AND THE ROAD BURNING WITH DUST. SEATED AT THE TABLE, I WOULD TRY TO BLINK MY EYELIDS SO AS TO CATCH THE MULTICOLORED DAZZLE OF THE WHITE-HOT SKY. OUR FACES DAMP WITH SWEAT, BUT OUR BODIES COOL IN LIGHT CLOTHING, WE WOULD FLAUNT THE HAPPY WEARINESS OF A DAY OF NUPTIALS WITH THE WORLD.

THE FOOD IS BAD IN THIS CAFÉ, BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF FRUIT, ESPECIALLY PEACHES, WHOSE JUICE DRIPS DOWN YOUR CHIN AS YOU BITE INTO THEM. GAZING AVIDLY BEFORE ME, MY TEETH CLOSING ON A PEACH, I CAN HEAR THE BLOOD POUNDING IN MY EARS. THE VAST SILENCE OF NOON HANGS OVER THE SEA. EVERY BEAUTIFUL THING HAS A NATURAL PRIDE IN ITS OWN BEAUTY, AND TODAY THE WORLD IS ALLOWING ITS PRIDE TO SEEP FROM EVERY PORE. WHY, IN ITS PRESENCE, SHOULD I DENY THE JOY OF LIVING, AS LONG AS I KNOW EVERYTHING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS JOY? THERE IS NO SHAME IN BEING HAPPY. BUT TODAY THE FOOL IS KING, AND I CALL THOSE WHO FEAR PLEASURE FOOLS. THEY’VE TOLD US SO MUCH ABOUT PRIDE: YOU KNOW, LUCIFER’S SIN. BEWARE, THEY USED TO CRY, YOU WILL LOSE YOUR SOUL, AND YOUR VITAL POWERS. I HAVE IN FACT LEARNED SINCE THAT A CERTAIN PRIDE … BUT AT OTHER TIMES I CANNOT PREVENT MYSELF FROM ASSERTING THE PRIDE IN LIVING THAT THE WHOLE WORLD CONSPIRES TO GIVE ME. AT TIPASA, “I SEE” EQUALS “I BELIEVE,” AND I AM NOT STUBBORN ENOUGH TO DENY WHAT MY HANDS CAN TOUCH AND MY LIPS CARESS. I DON’T FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE IT INTO A WORK OF ART, BUT TO DESCRIBE IT, WHICH IS DIFFERENT. TIPASA SEEMS TO ME LIKE A CHARACTER ONE DESCRIBES IN ORDER TO GIVE INDIRECT EXPRESSION TO A CERTAIN VIEW OF THE WORLD. LIKE SUCH CHARACTERS, TIPASA TESTIFIES TO SOMETHING, AND DOES IT LIKE A MAN. TIPASA IS THE PERSONAGE I’M DESCRIBING TODAY, AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VERY ACT OF CARESSING AND DESCRIBING MY DELIGHT WILL INSURE THAT IT HAS NO END. THERE IS A TIME FOR LIVING AND A TIME FOR GIVING EXPRESSION TO LIFE. THERE IS ALSO A TIME FOR CREATING, WHICH IS LESS NATURAL. FOR ME IT IS ENOUGH TO LIVE WITH MY WHOLE BODY AND BEAR WITNESS WITH MY WHOLE HEART. LIVE TIPASA, MANIFEST ITS LESSONS, AND THE WORK OF ART WILL COME LATER. HEREIN LIES A FREEDOM.

I NEVER SPENT MORE THAN A DAY AT TIPASA. A MOMENT ALWAYS COMES WHEN ONE HAS LOOKED TOO LONG AT A LANDSCAPE, JUST AS IT IS A LONG TIME BEFORE ONE SEES ENOUGH OF IT. MOUNTAINS, THE SKY, THE SEA ARE LIKE FACES WHOSE BARRENNESS OR SPLENDOR WE DISCOVER BY LOOKING RATHER THAN SEEING. BUT IN ORDER TO BE ELOQUENT EVERY FACE MUST BE SEEN ANEW. ONE COMPLAINS OF GROWING TIRED TOO QUICKLY, WHEN ONE OUGHT TO BE SURPRISED THAT THE WORLD SEEMS NEW ONLY BECAUSE WE HAVE FORGOTTEN IT.

TOWARD EVENING I WOULD RETURN TO A MORE FORMAL SECTION OF THE PARK, SET OUT AS A GARDEN, JUST OFF THE MAIN ROAD. LEAVING THE TUMULT OF SCENTS AND SUNLIGHT, IN THE COOL EVENING AIR, THE MIND WOULD GROW CALM AND THE BODY RELAXED, SAVORING THE INNER SILENCE BORN OF SATISFIED LOVE. I WOULD SIT ON A BENCH, WATCHING THE COUNTRYSIDE EXPAND WITH LIGHT. I WAS FULL. ABOVE ME DROOPED A POMEGRANATE TREE, ITS FLOWER BUDS CLOSED AND RIBBED LIKE SMALL TIGHT FISTS CONTAINING EVERY HOPE OF SPRING. THERE WAS ROSEMARY BEHIND ME, AND I COULD SMELL ONLY THE SCENT OF ITS ALCOHOL. THE HILLS WERE FRAMED WITH TREES, AND BEYOND THEM STRETCHED A BAND OF SEA ON WHICH THE SKY, LIKE A SAIL BECALMED, RESTED IN ALL ITS TENDERNESS. I FELT A STRANGE JOY IN MY HEART, THE SPECIAL JOY THAT STEMS FROM A CLEAR CONSCIENCE. THERE IS A FEELING ACTORS HAVE WHEN THEY KNOW THEY’VE PLAYED THEIR PART WELL, THAT IS TO SAY, WHEN THEY HAVE MADE THEIR OWN GESTURES COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF THE IDEAL CHARACTER THEY EMBODY, HAVING ENTERED SOMEHOW INTO A PREARRANGED DESIGN, BRINGING IT TO LIFE WITH THEIR OWN HEARTBEATS. THAT WAS EXACTLY WHAT I FELT: I HAD PLAYED MY PART WELL. I HAD PERFORMED MY TASK AS A MAN, AND THE FACT THAT I HAD KNOWN JOY FOR ONE ENTIRE DAY SEEMED TO ME NOT AN EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS BUT THE INTENSE FULFILLMENT OF A CONDITION WHICH, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, MAKES IT OUR DUTY TO BE HAPPY. THEN WE ARE ALONE AGAIN, BUT SATISFIED.

NOW THE TREES WERE FILLED WITH BIRDS. THE EARTH WOULD GIVE A LONG SIGH BEFORE SLIDING INTO DARKNESS. IN A MOMENT, WITH THE FIRST STAR, NIGHT WOULD FALL ON THE THEATER OF THE WORLD. THE DAZZLING GODS OF DAY WOULD RETURN TO THEIR DAILY DEATH. BUT OTHER GODS WOULD COME. AND, THOUGH THEY WOULD BE DARKER, THEIR RAVAGED FACES TOO WOULD COME FROM DEEP WITHIN THE EARTH.

FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST, THE WAVES’ ENDLESS CRASHING AGAINST THE SHORE CAME TOWARD ME THROUGH A SPACE DANCING WITH GOLDEN POLLEN. SEA, LANDSCAPE, SILENCE, SCENTS OF THIS EARTH, I WOULD DRINK MY FILL OF A SCENT-LADEN LIFE, SINKING MY TEETH INTO THE WORLD’S FRUIT, GOLDEN ALREADY, OVERWHELMED BY THE FEELING OF ITS STRONG, SWEET JUICE FLOWING ON MY LIPS. NO, IT WAS NEITHER I NOR THE WORLD THAT COUNTED, BUT SOLELY THE HARMONY AND SILENCE THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE LOVE BETWEEN US. A LOVE I WAS NOT FOOLISH ENOUGH TO CLAIM FOR MYSELF ALONE, PROUDLY AWARE THAT I SHARED IT WITH A WHOLE RACE BORN IN THE SUN AND SEA, ALIVE AND SPIRITED, DRAWING GREATNESS FROM ITS SIMPLICITY, AND UPRIGHT ON THE BEACHES, SMILING IN COMPLICITY AT THE BRILLIANCE OF ITS SKIES.

THERE ARE PLACES WHERE THE MIND DIES SO THAT A TRUTH WHICH IS ITS VERY DENIAL MAY BE BORN. WHEN I WENT TO DJEMILA, THERE WAS WIND AND SUN, BUT THAT IS ANOTHER STORY. WHAT MUST BE SAID FIRST OF ALL IS THAT A HEAVY, UNBROKEN SILENCE REIGNED THERE—SOMETHING LIKE A PERFECTLY BALANCED PAIR OF SCALES. THE CRY OF BIRDS, THE SOFT SOUND OF A THREE-HOLE FLUTE, GOATS TRAMPLING, MURMURS FROM THE SKY WERE JUST SO MANY SOUNDS ADDED TO THE SILENCE AND DESOLATION. NOW AND THEN A SHARP CLAP, A PIERCING CRY MARKED THE UPWARD FLIGHT OF A BIRD HUDDLED AMONG THE ROCKS. ANY TRAIL ONE FOLLOWED—THE PATHWAYS THROUGH THE RUINED HOUSES, ALONG WIDE, PAVED ROADS UNDER SHINING COLONNADES, ACROSS THE VAST FORUM BETWEEN THE TRIUMPHAL ARCH AND THE TEMPLE SET UPON A HILL—WOULD END AT THE RAVINES THAT SURROUND DJEMILA ON EVERY SIDE, LIKE A PACK OF CARDS OPENING BENEATH A LIMITLESS SKY. AND ONE WOULD STAND THERE, ABSORBED, CONFRONTED WITH STONES AND SILENCE, AS THE DAY MOVED ON AND THE MOUNTAINS GREW PURPLE SURGING UPWARD. BUT THE WIND BLOWS ACROSS THE PLATEAU OF DJEMILA. IN THE GREAT CONFUSION OF WIND AND SUN THAT MIXES LIGHT INTO THE RUINS, IN THE SILENCE AND SOLITUDE OF THIS DEAD CITY, SOMETHING IS FORGED THAT GIVES MAN THE MEASURE OF HIS IDENTITY.

IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET TO DJEMILA. IT IS NOT A TOWN WHERE YOU STOP AND THEN MOVE FURTHER ON. IT LEADS NOWHERE AND IS A GATEWAY TO NO OTHER COUNTRY. IT IS A PLACE FROM WHICH TRAVELERS RETURN. THE DEAD CITY LIES AT THE END OF A LONG, WINDING ROAD WHOSE EVERY TURNING LOOKS LIKE THE LAST, MAKING IT SEEM ALL THE LONGER. WHEN ITS SKELETON, YELLOWISH AS A FOREST OF BONES, AT LAST LOOMS UP AGAINST THE FADED COLORS OF THE PLATEAU, DJEMILA SEEMS THE SYMBOL OF THAT LESSON OF LOVE AND PATIENCE WHICH ALONE CAN LEAD US TO THE WORLD’S BEATING HEART. THERE IT LIES, AMONG A FEW TREES AND SOME DRIED GRASS, PROTECTED BY ALL ITS MOUNTAINS AND STONES FROM VULGAR ADMIRATION, FROM BEING PICTURESQUE, AND FROM THE DELUSIONS OF HOPE.

WE HAD WANDERED THE WHOLE DAY IN THIS ARID SPLENDOR. THE WIND, WHICH WE HAD SCARCELY FELT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AFTERNOON, SEEMED TO INCREASE AS THE HOURS WENT BY, LITTLE BY LITTLE FILLING THE WHOLE COUNTRYSIDE. IT BLEW FROM A GAP IN THE MOUNTAINS, FAR TO THE EAST, RUSHING FROM BEYOND THE HORIZON, LEAPING AND TUMBLING AMONG THE STONES AND IN THE SUNLIGHT. IT WHISTLED LOUDLY ACROSS THE RUINS, WHIRLED THROUGH AN AMPHITHEATER OF STONES AND EARTH, BATHING THE HEAPS OF POCK-MARKED STONE, CIRCLING EACH COLUMN WITH ITS BREATH AND SPREADING OUT IN ENDLESS CRIES ON THE FORUM, OPEN TO THE HEAVENS. I FELT MYSELF WHIPPING IN THE WIND LIKE A MAST, HOLLOWED AT THE WAIST. EYES BURNING, LIPS CRACKING, MY SKIN BECAME SO DRY IT NO LONGER SEEMED MINE. UNTIL NOW, I HAD BEEN DECIPHERING THE WORLD’S HANDWRITING ON MY SKIN. THERE, ON MY BODY, THE WORLD HAD INSCRIBED THE SIGNS OF ITS TENDERNESS OR ANGER, WARMING WITH ITS SUMMER BREATH OR BITING WITH ITS FROSTY TEETH. BUT RUBBED AGAINST FOR SO LONG BY THE WIND, SHAKEN FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR, STAGGERING FROM RESISTANCE TO IT, I LOST CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PATTERN MY BODY TRACED. LIKE A PEBBLE POLISHED BY THE TIDES, I WAS POLISHED BY THE WIND, WORN THROUGH TO THE VERY SOUL. I WAS A PORTION OF THE GREAT FORCE ON WHICH I DRIFTED, THEN MUCH OF IT, THEN ENTIRELY IT, CONFUSING THE THROBBING OF MY OWN HEART WITH THE GREAT SONOROUS BEATING OF THIS OMNIPRESENT NATURAL HEART. THE WIND WAS FASHIONING ME IN THE IMAGE OF THE BURNING NAKEDNESS AROUND ME. AND ITS FUGITIVE EMBRACE GAVE ME, A STONE AMONG STONES, THE SOLITUDE OF A COLUMN OR AN OLIVE TREE IN THE SUMMER SKY.

THE VIOLENT BATH OF SUN AND WIND DRAINED ME OF ALL STRENGTH. I SCARCELY FELT THE QUIVERING OF WINGS INSIDE ME, LIFE’S COMPLAINT, THE WEAK REBELLION OF THE MIND. SOON, SCATTERED TO THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE EARTH, SELF-FORGETFUL AND SELF-FORGOTTEN, I AM THE WIND AND WITHIN IT, THE COLUMNS AND THE ARCHWAY, THE FLAGSTONES WARM TO THE TOUCH, THE PALE MOUNTAINS AROUND THE DESERTED CITY. AND NEVER HAVE I FELT SO DEEPLY AND AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME SO DETACHED FROM MYSELF AND SO PRESENT IN THE WORLD.

YES, I AM PRESENT. AND WHAT STRIKES ME AT THIS MOMENT IS THAT I CAN GO NO FURTHER—LIKE A MAN SENTENCED TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT, TO WHOM EVERYTHING IS PRESENT. BUT ALSO LIKE A MAN WHO KNOWS THAT TOMORROW WILL BE THE SAME, AND EVERY OTHER DAY. FOR WHEN A MAN BECOMES CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HE IS NOW, IT MEANS HE EXPECTS NOTHING FURTHER. IF THERE ARE LANDSCAPES LIKE MOODS, THEY ARE THE MOST VULGAR. ALL THROUGH THIS COUNTRY I FOLLOWED SOMETHING THAT BELONGED NOT TO ME BUT TO IT, SOMETHING LIKE A TASTE FOR DEATH WE BOTH HAD IN COMMON. BETWEEN THE COLUMNS WITH THEIR NOW LENGTHENING SHADOWS ANXIETIES DISSOLVED INTO THE AIR LIKE WOUNDED BIRDS. AND IN THEIR PLACE CAME AN ARID LUCIDITY. ANXIETY SPRINGS FROM LIVING HEARTS. BUT CALM WILL HIDE THIS LIVING HEART: THIS IS ALL I CAN SEE CLEARLY. AS THE DAY MOVED FORWARD, AS THE NOISES AND LIGHTS WERE MUFFLED BY THE ASHES FALLING FROM THE SKY, DESERTED BY MYSELF, I FELT DEFENSELESS AGAINST THE SLOW FORCES WITHIN ME THAT WERE SAYING NO.

FEW PEOPLE REALIZE THAT THERE IS A REFUSAL THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH RENUNCIATION. WHAT MEANING DO WORDS LIKE FUTURE, IMPROVEMENT, GOOD JOB HAVE HERE? WHAT IS MEANT BY THE HEART’S PROGRESS? IF I OBSTINATELY REFUSE ALL THE “LATER ON’S” OF THIS WORLD, IT IS BECAUSE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GIVE UP MY PRESENT WEALTH. I DO NOT WANT TO BELIEVE THAT DEATH IS THE GATEWAY TO ANOTHER LIFE. FOR ME, IT IS A CLOSED DOOR. I DO NOT SAY IT IS A STEP WE MUST ALL TAKE, BUT THAT IT IS A HORRIBLE AND DIRTY ADVENTURE. EVERYTHING I AM OFFERED SEEKS TO DELIVER MAN FROM THE WEIGHT OF HIS OWN LIFE. BUT AS I WATCH THE GREAT BIRDS FLYING HEAVILY THROUGH THE SKY AT DJEMILA, IT IS PRECISELY A CERTAIN WEIGHT OF LIFE THAT I ASK FOR AND OBTAIN. IF I AM AT ONE WITH THIS PASSIVE PASSION, THE REST CEASES TO CONCERN ME. I HAVE TOO MUCH YOUTH IN ME TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK OF DEATH. BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IF I HAD TO SPEAK OF IT, I WOULD FIND THE RIGHT WORD HERE BETWEEN HORROR AND SILENCE TO EXPRESS THE CONSCIOUS CERTAINTY OF A DEATH WITHOUT HOPE.

WE LIVE WITH A FEW FAMILIAR IDEAS. TWO OR THREE. WE POLISH AND TRANSFORM THEM ACCORDING TO THE SOCIETIES AND THE MEN WE HAPPEN TO MEET. IT TAKES TEN YEARS TO HAVE AN IDEA THAT IS REALLY ONE’S OWN—THAT ONE CAN TALK ABOUT. THIS IS A BIT DISCOURAGING, OF COURSE. BUT WE GAIN FROM THIS A CERTAIN FAMILIARITY WITH THE SPLENDOR OF THE WORLD. UNTIL THEN, WE HAVE SEEN IT FACE TO FACE. NOW WE NEED TO STEP ASIDE TO SEE ITS PROFILE. A YOUNG MAN LOOKS THE WORLD IN THE FACE. HE HAS NOT HAD TIME TO POLISH THE IDEA OF DEATH OR OF NOTHINGNESS, EVEN THOUGH HE HAS GAZED ON THEIR FULL HORROR. THAT IS WHAT YOUTH MUST BE LIKE, THIS HARSH CONFRONTATION WITH DEATH, THIS PHYSICAL TERROR OF THE ANIMAL WHO LOVES THE SUN. WHATEVER PEOPLE MAY SAY, ON THIS SCORE AT LEAST, YOUTH HAS NO ILLUSIONS. IT HAS HAD NEITHER THE TIME NOR THE PIETY TO BUILD ITSELF ANY. AND, I DON’T KNOW WHY, BUT FACED WITH THIS RAVINED LANDSCAPE, THIS SOLEMN AND LUGUBRIOUS CRY OF STONE, DJEMILA, INHUMAN AT NIGHTFALL, FACED WITH THIS DEATH OF COLORS AND HOPE, I WAS CERTAIN THAT WHEN THEY REACH THE END OF THEIR LIVES, MEN WORTHY OF THE NAME MUST REDISCOVER THIS CONFRONTATION, DENY THE FEW IDEAS THEY HAD, AND RECOVER THE INNOCENCE AND TRUTH THAT GLEAMED IN THE EYES OF THE ANCIENTS FACE TO FACE WITH DESTINY. THEY REGAIN THEIR YOUTH, BUT BY EMBRACING DEATH. THERE IS NOTHING MORE DESPICABLE IN THIS RESPECT THAN ILLNESS. IT IS A REMEDY AGAINST DEATH. IT PREPARES US FOR IT. IT CREATES AN APPRENTICESHIP WHOSE FIRST STAGE IS SELF-PITY. IT SUPPORTS MAN IN HIS GREAT EFFORT TO AVOID THE CERTAINTY THAT HE WILL DIE COMPLETELY. BUT DJEMILA … AND THEN I FEEL CERTAIN THAT THE TRUE, THE ONLY, PROGRESS OF CIVILIZATION, THE ONE TO WHICH A MAN DEVOTES HIMSELF FROM TIME TO TIME, LIES IN CREATING CONSCIOUS DEATHS.

WHAT ALWAYS AMAZES ME, WHEN WE ARE SO SWIFT TO ELABORATE ON OTHER SUBJECTS, IS THE POVERTY OF OUR IDEAS ON DEATH. IT IS A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING, I FEAR IT OR I SUMMON IT (THEY SAY). WHICH ALSO PROVES THAT EVERYTHING SIMPLE IS BEYOND US. WHAT IS BLUE, AND HOW DO WE THINK “BLUE”? THE SAME DIFFICULTY OCCURS WITH DEATH. DEATH AND COLORS ARE THINGS WE CANNOT DISCUSS. NONETHELESS, THE IMPORTANT THING IS THIS MAN BEFORE ME, HEAVY AS EARTH, WHO PREFIGURES MY FUTURE. BUT CAN I REALLY THINK ABOUT IT? I TELL MYSELF: I AM GOING TO DIE, BUT THIS MEANS NOTHING, SINCE I CANNOT MANAGE TO BELIEVE IT AND CAN ONLY EXPERIENCE OTHER PEOPLE’S DEATH. I HAVE SEEN PEOPLE DIE. ABOVE ALL, I HAVE SEEN DOGS DIE. IT WAS TOUCHING THEM THAT OVERWHELMED ME. THEN I THINK OF FLOWERS, SMILES, THE DESIRE FOR WOMEN, AND REALIZE THAT MY WHOLE HORROR OF DEATH LIES IN MY ANXIETY TO LIVE. I AM JEALOUS OF THOSE WHO WILL LIVE AND FOR WHOM FLOWERS AND THE DESIRE FOR WOMEN WILL HAVE THEIR FULL FLESH AND BLOOD MEANING. I AM ENVIOUS BECAUSE I LOVE LIFE TOO MUCH NOT TO BE SELFISH. WHAT DOES ETERNITY MATTER TO ME. YOU CAN BE LYING IN BED ONE DAY AND HEAR SOMEONE SAY: “YOU ARE STRONG AND I OWE IT TO YOU TO BE HONEST: I CAN TELL YOU THAT YOU ARE GOING TO DIE”; YOU’RE THERE, WITH YOUR WHOLE LIFE IN YOUR HANDS, FEAR IN YOUR BOWELS, LOOKING THE FOOL. WHAT ELSE MATTERS: WAVES OF BLOOD COME THROBBING TO MY TEMPLES AND I FEEL I COULD SMASH EVERYTHING AROUND ME.

BUT MEN DIE IN SPITE OF THEMSELVES, IN SPITE OF THEIR SURROUNDINGS. THEY ARE TOLD: “WHEN YOU GET WELL …,” AND THEY DIE. I WANT NONE OF THAT. FOR IF THERE ARE DAYS WHEN NATURE LIES, THERE ARE OTHERS WHEN SHE TELLS THE TRUTH. DJEMILA IS TELLING THE TRUTH TONIGHT, AND WITH WHAT SAD, INSISTENT BEAUTY! AS FOR ME, HERE IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS WORLD, I HAVE NO WISH TO LIE OR TO BE LIED TO. I WANT TO KEEP MY LUCIDITY TO THE LAST, AND GAZE UPON MY DEATH WITH ALL THE FULLNESS OF MY JEALOUSY AND HORROR. IT IS TO THE EXTENT I CUT MYSELF OFF FROM THE WORLD THAT I FEAR DEATH MOST, TO THE DEGREE I ATTACH MYSELF TO THE FATE OF LIVING MEN INSTEAD OF CONTEMPLATING THE UNCHANGING SKY. CREATING CONSCIOUS DEATHS IS TO DIMINISH THE DISTANCE THAT SEPARATES US FROM THE WORLD AND TO ACCEPT A CONSUMMATION WITHOUT JOY, ALERT TO RAPTUROUS IMAGES OF A WORLD FOREVER LOST. AND THE MELANCHOLY SONG OF THE DJEMILA HILLS PLUNGES THIS BITTER LESSON DEEPER IN MY SOUL.

TOWARD EVENING, WE WERE CLIMBING THE SLOPES LEADING TO THE VILLAGE AND, RETRACING OUR STEPS, LISTENED TO EXPLANATIONS: “HERE IS THE PAGAN TOWN; THIS AREA OUTSIDE THE FIELD IS WHERE THE CHRISTIANS LIVED. LATER ON …” YES, IT IS TRUE. MEN AND SOCIETIES HAVE SUCCEEDED ONE ANOTHER IN THIS PLACE; CONQUERORS HAVE MARKED THIS COUNTRY WITH THEIR NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER’S CIVILIZATION. THEY HAD A VULGAR AND RIDICULOUS IDEA OF GREATNESS, MEASURING THE GRANDEUR OF THEIR EMPIRE BY THE SURFACE IT COVERED. THE MIRACLE IS THAT THE RUIN OF THEIR CIVILIZATION IS THE VERY NEGATION OF THEIR IDEAL. FOR THIS SKELETON TOWN, SEEN FROM HIGH ABOVE AS EVENING CLOSES IN AND WHITE FLIGHTS OF PIGEONS CIRCLE ROUND THE TRIUMPHAL ARCH, ENGRAVED NO SIGNS OF CONQUEST OR AMBITION ON THE SKY. THE WORLD ALWAYS CONQUERS HISTORY IN THE END. THE GREAT SHOUT OF STONE THAT DJEMILA HURLS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS, THE SKY, AND THE SILENCE—WELL DO I KNOW ITS POETRY: LUCIDITY, INDIFFERENCE, THE TRUE SIGNS OF BEAUTY OR DESPAIR. THE HEART TIGHTENS AT THE GRANDEUR WE’VE ALREADY LEFT BEHIND. DJEMILA REMAINS WITH ITS SAD WATERY SKY, THE SONG OF A BIRD FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PLATEAU, THE SUDDEN, QUICK SCURRYING OF GOATS ALONG THE MOUNTAINSIDE, AND, IN THE CALM, RESONANT DUSK, THE LIVING FACE OF A HORNED GOD ON THE PEDIMENT OF AN ALTAR.

BUT YOU, YOU WERE BORN FOR A LIMPID DAY.

HÖLDERLIN

I FELT THE GODS WERE LACKING AS LONG AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO OPPOSE THEM.

LUCIAN, PROMETHEUS IN THE CAUCASUS

I GREW UP WITH THE SEA AND POVERTY FOR ME WAS SUMPTUOUS; THEN I LOST THE SEA AND FOUND ALL LUXURIES GRAY AND POVERTY UNBEARABLE. SINCE THEN, I HAVE BEEN WAITING. I WAIT FOR THE HOMEBOUND SHIPS, THE HOUSE OF THE WATERS, THE LIMPIDITY OF DAY. I WAIT PATIENTLY, AM POLITE WITH ALL MY STRENGTH. I AM SEEN WALKING BY ON FINE, SOPHISTICATED STREETS, I ADMIRE LANDSCAPES, I APPLAUD LIKE EVERYONE, SHAKE HANDS, BUT IT IS NOT I WHO SPEAK. MEN PRAISE ME, I DREAM A LITTLE, THEY INSULT ME, I SCARCELY SHOW SURPRISE. THEN I FORGET, AND SMILE AT THE MAN WHO INSULTED ME, OR AM TOO COURTEOUS IN GREETING THE PERSON I LOVE. CAN I HELP IT IF ALL I REMEMBER IS ONE IMAGE? FINALLY THEY SUMMON ME TO TELL THEM WHO I AM. “NOTHING YET, NOTHING YET …”

I SURPASS MYSELF AT FUNERALS. TRULY, I EXCEL. I WALK SLOWLY THROUGH THE IRON-STREWN SUBURBS, TAKING THE WIDE LANES PLANTED WITH CEMENT TREES THAT LEAD TO HOLES IN THE COLD GROUND. THERE, BENEATH THE SLIGHTLY REDDENED BANDAGE OF THE SKY, I WATCH BOLD WORKMEN INTER MY FRIENDS BENEATH SIX FEET OF EARTH. IF I TOSS THE FLOWER A CLAY-COVERED HAND HOLDS OUT TO ME, IT NEVER MISSES THE GRAVE. MY PIETY IS EXACT, MY FEELINGS AS THEY SHOULD BE, MY HEAD SUITABLY INCLINED. I AM ADMIRED FOR FINDING JUST THE RIGHT WORD. BUT I TAKE NO CREDIT: I AM WAITING.

I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME. SOMETIMES, I STUMBLE, I LOSE MY TOUCH, SUCCESS EVADES ME. WHAT DOES IT MATTER, I AM ALONE THEN. I WAKE UP AT NIGHT, AND, STILL HALF ASLEEP, THINK I HEAR THE SOUND OF WAVES, THE BREATHING OF WATERS. FULLY AWAKE, I RECOGNIZE THE WIND IN THE TREES AND THE SAD MURMUR OF THE EMPTY TOWN. AFTERWARD, ALL MY ART IS NOT TOO MUCH TO HIDE MY ANGUISH OR CLOTHE IT IN THE PREVAILING FASHION.

AT OTHER TIMES, IT’S THE OPPOSITE, AND I AM HELPED. ON CERTAIN DAYS IN NEW YORK, LOST AT THE BOTTOM OF THOSE STONE AND STEEL SHAFTS WHERE MILLIONS OF MEN WANDER, I WOULD RUN FROM ONE SHAFT TO THE NEXT, WITHOUT SEEING WHERE THEY ENDED, UNTIL, EXHAUSTED, I WAS SUSTAINED ONLY BY THE HUMAN MASS SEEKING ITS WAY OUT. BUT, EACH TIME, THERE WAS THE DISTANT HONKING OF A TUGBOAT TO REMIND ME THAT THIS EMPTY WELL OF A CITY WAS AN ISLAND, AND THAT OFF THE TIP OF THE BATTERY THE WATER OF MY BAPTISM LAY IN WAIT FOR ME, BLACK AND ROTTING, COVERED WITH HOLLOW CORKS.

THUS, I WHO OWN NOTHING, WHO HAVE GIVEN AWAY MY FORTUNE, WHO CAMP IN ALL MY HOUSES, AM STILL HEAPED, WHEN I CHOOSE, WITH EVERY BLESSING; I CAN SET SAIL AT ANY HOUR, A STRANGER TO DESPAIR. THERE IS NO COUNTRY FOR THOSE WHO DESPAIR, BUT I KNOW THAT THE SEA PRECEDES AND FOLLOWS ME, AND I HOLD MY MADNESS READY. THOSE WHO LOVE AND ARE SEPARATED CAN LIVE IN GRIEF, BUT THIS IS NOT DESPAIR: THEY KNOW THAT LOVE EXISTS. THIS IS WHY I SUFFER, DRY-EYED, IN EXILE. I AM STILL WAITING. A DAY COMES, AT LAST …

THE SAILORS’ BARE FEET BEAT SOFTLY ON THE DECK. WE ARE SETTING SAIL AT DAYBREAK. THE MOMENT WE LEAVE THE HARBOR A SHORT, GUSTY WIND VIGOROUSLY BRUSHES THE SEA, WHICH CURLS BACKWARD IN SMALL, FOAMLESS WAVES. A LITTLE LATER, THE WIND FRESHENS AND STREWS THE SEA WITH SWIFTLY VANISHING CAMELLIAS. THUS, THROUGHOUT THE MORNING, WE HEAR OUR SAILS SLAPPING ABOVE A CHEERFUL POND. THE WATERS ARE HEAVY, SCALY, COVERED WITH COOL FROTH. FROM TIME TO TIME THE WAVES LAP AGAINST THE BOW; A BITTER, UNCTUOUS FOAM, THE GODS’ SALIVA, FLOWS ALONG THE WOOD AND LOSES ITSELF IN THE WATER, WHERE IT SCATTERS INTO SHAPES THAT DIE AND ARE REBORN, THE HIDE OF SOME WHITE AND BLUE COW, AN EXHAUSTED BEAST THAT FLOATS FOR A LONG TIME IN OUR WAKE.

EVER SINCE OUR DEPARTURE, THE SEAGULLS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING OUR SHIP, APPARENTLY WITHOUT EFFORT, ALMOST WITHOUT MOVING THEIR WINGS. THEIR FINE, STRAIGHT NAVIGATION SCARCELY LEANS UPON THE BREEZE. SUDDENLY, A LOUD PLOP AT THE LEVEL OF THE KITCHENS STIRS UP A GREEDY ALARM AMONG THE BIRDS, THROWING THEIR FINE FLIGHT INTO CONFUSION AND SENDING UP A FIRE OF WHITE WINGS. THE SEAGULLS WHIRL MADLY IN EVERY DIRECTION AND THEN WITH NO LOSS OF SPEED DROP FROM THE FIGHT ONE BY ONE AND DIVE TOWARD THE SEA. A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY ARE TOGETHER AGAIN ON THE WATER, A QUARRELSOME FARMYARD THAT WE LEAVE BEHIND, NESTING IN THE HOLLOW OF THE WAVE, SLOWLY PICKING THROUGH THE MANNA OF THE SCRAPS.

AT NOON, UNDER A DEAFENING SUN, THE SEA IS SO EXHAUSTED IT SCARCELY FINDS THE STRENGTH TO RISE. WHEN IT FALLS BACK ON ITSELF IT MAKES THE SILENCE WHISTLE. AFTER AN HOUR’S COOKING, THE PALE WATER, A VAST WHITE-HOT IRON SHEET, SIZZLES. IN A MINUTE IT WILL TURN AND OFFER ITS DAMP SIDE, NOW HIDDEN IN WAVES AND DARKNESS, TO THE SUN.

WE PASS THE GATES OF HERCULES, THE HEADLAND WHERE ANTAEUS DIED. BEYOND, THERE IS OCEAN EVERYWHERE; ON ONE SIDE WE PASS THE HORN AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE, THE MERIDIANS WED THE LATITUDES, THE PACIFIC DRINKS THE ATLANTIC. AT ONCE, SETTING COURSE FOR VANCOUVER, WE SAIL SLOWLY TOWARD THE SOUTH SEAS. A FEW CABLE LENGTHS AWAY, EASTER ISLAND, DESOLATION, AND THE NEW HEBRIDES FILE PAST US IN CONVOY. SUDDENLY, ONE MORNING, THE SEAGULLS DISAPPEAR. WE ARE FAR FROM ANY LAND, AND ALONE, WITH OUR SAILS AND OUR ENGINES.

ALONE ALSO WITH THE HORIZON. THE WAVES COME FROM THE INVISIBLE EAST, PATIENTLY, ONE BY ONE; THEY REACH US, AND THEN, PATIENTLY, SET OFF AGAIN FOR THE UNKNOWN WEST, ONE BY ONE. A LONG VOYAGE, WITH NO BEGINNING AND NO END … RIVERS AND STREAMS PASS BY, THE SEA PASSES AND REMAINS. THIS IS HOW ONE OUGHT TO LOVE, FAITHFUL AND FLEETING. I WED THE SEA.

THE HIGH SEAS. THE SUN SINKS AND IS SWALLOWED BY THE FOG LONG BEFORE IT REACHES THE HORIZON. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, THE SEA IS PINK ON ONE SIDE AND BLUE ON THE OTHER. THEN THE WATERS GROW DARKER. THE SCHOONER SLIDES, MINUTE, OVER THE SURFACE OF A PERFECT CIRCLE OF THICK, TARNISHED METAL. AND, AT THE MOST PEACEFUL HOUR, AS EVENING COMES, HUNDREDS OF PORPOISES EMERGE FROM THE WATER, FROLIC AROUND US FOR A MOMENT, THEN FLEE TO THE HORIZON WHERE THERE ARE NO MEN. WITH THEM GONE, SILENCE AND THE ANGUISH OF PRIMITIVE WATERS ARE WHAT REMAIN.

•  •  •

A LITTLE LATER STILL, WE MEET AN ICEBERG ON THE TROPIC. INVISIBLE, TO BE SURE, AFTER ITS LONG VOYAGE IN THESE WARM WATERS, BUT STILL EFFECTIVE: IT PASSES TO STARBOARD, WHERE THE RIGGING IS BRIEFLY COVERED WITH A FROSTY DEW, WHILE TO PORT THE DAY DIES WITHOUT MOISTURE.

NIGHT DOES NOT FALL AT SEA. IT RISES, RATHER, TOWARD THE STILL PALE SKY, FROM THE DEPTHS OF WATERS AN ALREADY DROWNED SUN GRADUALLY DARKENS WITH ITS THICK ASHES. FOR A BRIEF MOMENT, VENUS SHINES ALONE ABOVE THE BLACK WAVES. IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE, STARS SWARM IN THE LIQUID NIGHT.

THE MOON HAS RISEN. FIRST IT LIGHTS THE WATER’S SURFACE GENTLY, THEN CLIMBS HIGHER AND INSCRIBES ITSELF IN THE SUPPLE WATER. AT LAST, AT ITS ZENITH, IT LIGHTS A WHOLE CORRIDOR OF SEA, A RICH RIVER OF MILK WHICH, WITH THE MOTION OF THE SHIP, STREAMS DOWN INEXHAUSTIBLY TOWARD US ACROSS THE DARK OCEAN. HERE IS THE FAITHFUL NIGHT, THE COOL NIGHT I CALLED FOR IN THE ROLLICKING LIGHTS, THE ALCOHOL, THE TUMULT OF DESIRE.

WE SAIL ACROSS SPACES SO VAST THEY SEEM UNENDING. SUN AND MOON RISE AND FALL IN TURN, ON THE SAME THREAD OF LIGHT AND NIGHT. DAYS AT SEA, AS SIMILAR EACH TO THE OTHER AS HAPPINESS …

THIS LIFE REBELLIOUS TO FORGETFULNESS, REBELLIOUS TO MEMORY, THAT STEVENSON SPEAKS OF.

DAWN. WE SAIL PERPENDICULARLY ACROSS THE TROPIC OF CANCER, THE WATERS GROAN AND ARE CONVULSED. DAY BREAKS OVER A SURGING SEA, FULL OF STEEL SPANGLES. THE SKY IS WHITE WITH MIST AND HEAT, WITH A DEAD BUT UNBEARABLE GLARE, AS IF THE SUN HAD TURNED LIQUID IN THE THICKNESS OF THE CLOUDS, OVER THE WHOLE EXPANSE OF THE CELESTIAL VAULT. A SICK SKY OVER A DECOMPOSING SEA. AS THE DAY DRAWS ON, THE HEAT GROWS IN THE WHITE AIR. ALL DAY LONG, OUR BOW NOSES OUT CLOUDS OF FLYING FISH, TINY IRON BIRDS, FORCING THEM FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES IN THE WAVES.

IN THE AFTERNOON, WE MEET A STEAMER BOUND FOR HOME. THE SALUTE OUR FOGHORNS EXCHANGE WITH THREE GREAT PREHISTORIC HOOTS, THE SIGNALS OF PASSENGERS LOST AT SEA WARNING THERE ARE OTHER HUMANS PRESENT, THE GRADUALLY INCREASING DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO SHIPS, THEIR SEPARATION AT LAST ON THE MALEVOLENT WATERS, ALL THIS FILLS THE HEART WITH PAIN. THESE STUBBORN MADMEN, CLINGING TO PLANKS TOSSED UPON THE MANE OF IMMENSE OCEANS, IN PURSUIT OF DRIFTING ISLANDS: WHAT MAN WHO CHERISHES SOLITUDE AND THE SEA WILL EVER KEEP HIMSELF FROM LOVING THEM?

IN THE VERY MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC, WE BEND BENEATH THE SAVAGE WINDS THAT BLOW ENDLESSLY FROM POLE TO POLE. EACH CRY WE UTTER IS LOST, FLIES OFF INTO LIMITLESS SPACE. BUT THIS SHOUT, CARRIED DAY AFTER DAY ON THE WINDS, WILL FINALLY REACH LAND AT ONE OF THE FLATTENED ENDS OF THE EARTH AND ECHO TIMELESSLY AGAINST THE FROZEN WALLS UNTIL A MAN, LOST SOMEWHERE IN HIS SHELL OF SNOW, HEARS IT AND WANTS TO SMILE WITH HAPPINESS.

I WAS HALF ASLEEP IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON SUN WHEN A TERRIBLE NOISE AWOKE ME. I SAW THE SUN IN THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA, THE WAVES REIGNING IN THE SURGING HEAVENS. SUDDENLY, THE SEA WAS AFIRE, THE SUN FLOWED IN LONG ICY DRAUGHTS DOWN MY THROAT. THE SAILORS LAUGHED AND WEPT AROUND ME. THEY LOVED, BUT COULD NOT FORGIVE ONE ANOTHER. I RECOGNIZED THE WORLD FOR WHAT IT WAS THAT DAY. I DECIDED TO ACCEPT THE FACT THAT ITS GOOD MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME BE EVIL AND ITS TRANSGRESSIONS BENEFICIAL. I REALIZED THAT DAY THAT THERE WERE TWO TRUTHS, AND THAT ONE OF THEM OUGHT NEVER TO BE UTTERED.

THE CURIOUS AUSTRAL MOON, LOOKING SLIGHTLY PARED, KEEPS US COMPANY FOR SEVERAL NIGHTS AND THEN SLIDES RAPIDLY FROM THE SKY INTO THE SEA, WHICH SWALLOWS IT. THE SOUTHERN CROSS, THE INFREQUENT STARS, THE POROUS AIR REMAIN. AT THE SAME INSTANT, THE WIND CEASES. THE SKY ROLLS AND PITCHES ABOVE OUR IMMOBILE MASTS. ENGINE DEAD, SAILS HOVE TO, WE ARE WHISTLING IN THE WARM NIGHT AS THE WATER BEATS AMICABLY AGAINST OUR SIDES. NO COMMANDS, THE MACHINES ARE SILENT. WHY INDEED SHOULD WE CONTINUE AND WHY RETURN? OUR CUP RUNNETH OVER, A MUTE RAPTURE LULLS US INVINCIBLY TO SLEEP. THERE ARE DAYS LIKE THIS WHEN ALL IS ACCOMPLISHED; WE MUST LET OURSELVES FLOW WITH THEM, LIKE SWIMMERS WHO KEEP ON UNTIL EXHAUSTED. WHAT CAN WE ACCOMPLISH? I HAVE ALWAYS CONCEALED IT FROM MYSELF. OH BITTER BED, PRINCELY COUCH, THE CROWN LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAS.

IN THE MORNING, THE LUKEWARM WATER FOAMS GENTLY UNDER OUR PROPELLER. WE PUT ON SPEED. TOWARD NOON, TRAVELING FROM DISTANT CONTINENTS, A HERD OF WALRUSES CROSS OUR PATH, OVERTAKE US, AND SWIM RHYTHMICALLY TO THE NORTH, FOLLOWED BY MULTICOLORED BIRDS WHICH FROM TIME TO TIME ALIGHT UPON THEIR TUSKS. THIS RUSTLING FOREST SLOWLY VANISHES ON THE HORIZON. A LITTLE LATER THE SEA IS COVERED WITH STRANGE YELLOW FLOWERS. TOWARD EVENING, FOR HOUR AFTER HOUR, WE ARE PRECEDED BY AN INVISIBLE SONG. COMFORTABLY, I FALL ASLEEP.

ALL SAILS STRETCHED TO THE KEEN BREEZE, WE SKIM ACROSS A CLEAR AND RIPPLING SEA. AT TOP SPEED, OUR HELM GOES HARD TO PORT. AND TOWARD NIGHTFALL, CORRECTING OUR COURSE AGAIN, LISTING SO FAR TO STARBOARD THAT OUR SAILS SKIM THE WATER, WE SAIL RAPIDLY ALONG THE SIDE OF A SOUTHERN CONTINENT I RECOGNIZE FROM HAVING ONCE FLOWN BLINDLY OVER IT IN THE BARBAROUS COFFIN OF AN AIRPLANE. I WAS AN IDLE KING AND MY CHARIOT DAWDLED; I WAITED FOR THE SEA BUT IT NEVER CAME. THE MONSTER ROARED, TOOK OFF FROM THE GUANO FIELDS OF PERU, HURLED ITSELF ABOVE THE BEACHES OF THE PACIFIC, FLEW OVER THE FRACTURED WHITE VERTEBRAE OF THE ANDES AND THEN ABOVE THE HERDS OF FLIES THAT COVER THE IMMENSE ARGENTINIAN PLAIN, LINKING IN ONE SWOOP THE MILK-DROWNED URUGUAYAN MEADOWS TO VENEZUELA’S BLACK RIVERS, LANDING, ROARING AGAIN, QUIVERING WITH GREED AT THE SIGHT OF NEW EMPTY SPACES TO DEVOUR, AND YET NEVER FAILING TO MOVE FORWARD OR AT LEAST DOING SO ONLY WITH A CONVULSED, OBSTINATE SLOWNESS, A FIXED, WEARY, AND INTOXICATED ENERGY. I FELT I WAS DYING IN THIS METALLIC CELL AND DREAMED OF BLOODSHED AND ORGIES. WITHOUT SPACE, THERE IS NEITHER INNOCENCE NOR LIBERTY! WHEN A MAN CANNOT BREATHE, PRISON MEANS DEATH OR MADNESS; WHAT CAN HE DO THERE BUT KILL AND POSSESS? BUT TODAY I HAVE ALL THE AIR I NEED, ALL OUR SAILS SLAP IN THE BLUE AIR, I AM GOING TO SHOUT AT THE SPEED, WE’LL TOSS OUR SEXTANTS AND COMPASSES INTO THE SEA.

OUR SAILS ARE LIKE IRON UNDER THE IMPERIOUS WIND. THE COAST DRIFTS AT FULL SPEED BEFORE OUR EYES, FORESTS OF ROYAL COCONUT TREES WHOSE FEET ARE BATHED BY EMERALD LAGOONS, A QUIET BAY, FULL OF RED SAILS, MOONLIT BEACHES. GREAT BUILDINGS LOOM UP, ALREADY CRACKING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF THE VIRGIN FOREST THAT BEGINS IN THE BACK YARDS; HERE AND THERE A YELLOW IPECAC OR A TREE WITH VIOLET BRANCHES BURSTS THROUGH A WINDOW; RIO FINALLY CRUMBLES AWAY BEHIND US AND THE MONKEYS OF THE TIJUCA WILL LAUGH AND GIBBER IN THE VEGETATION THAT WILL COVER ITS NEW RUINS. FASTER STILL, ALONG WIDE BEACHES WHERE THE WAVES SPREAD OUT IN SHEAVES OF SAND, FASTER STILL, WHERE THE URUGUAYAN SHEEP WADE INTO THE SEA AND INSTANTLY TURN IT YELLOW. THEN, ON THE ARGENTINIAN COAST, GREAT CRUDE PILES OF FAGGOTS, SET UP AT REGULAR INTERVALS, RAISE SLOWLY GRILLING HALVES OF OXEN TO THE SKY. AT NIGHT, THE ICE FROM TIERRA DEL FUEGO COMES AND BEATS FOR HOURS AGAINST OUR HULL, THE SHIP HARDLY LOSES SPEED AND TACKS ABOUT. IN THE MORNING, THE SINGLE WAVE OF THE PACIFIC, WHOSE COLD FOAM BOILS GREEN AND WHITE FOR THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS ALONG THE CHILEAN COAST, SLOWLY LIFTS US UP AND THREATENS TO WRECK US. THE HELM AVOIDS IT, OVERTAKES THE KERGUELEN ISLANDS. IN THE SWEETISH EVENING THE FIRST MALAYAN BOATS COME OUT TO MEET US.

“TO SEA! TO SEA!” SHOUTED THE MARVELOUS BOYS IN ONE OF THE BOOKS FROM MY CHILDHOOD. I HAVE FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING ABOUT THAT BOOK EXCEPT THIS CRY. “TO SEA!”, AND ACROSS THE INDIAN OCEAN INTO THE CORRIDOR OF THE RED SEA, WHERE ON SILENT NIGHTS ONE CAN HEAR THE DESERT STONES, SCORCHED IN THE DAYTIME, FREEZE AND CRACK ONE BY ONE AS WE RETURN TO THE ANCIENT SEA IN WHICH ALL CRIES ARE HUSHED.

FINALLY, ONE MORNING, WE DROP ANCHOR IN A BAY FILLED WITH A STRANGE SILENCE, BEACONED WITH FIXED SAILS. A FEW SEA BIRDS ARE QUARRELLING IN THE SKY OVER SCRAPS OF REEDS. WE SWIM ASHORE TO AN EMPTY BEACH; ALL DAY PLUNGING INTO THE WATER AND DRYING OFF ON THE SAND. WHEN EVENING COMES, UNDER A SKY THAT TURNS GREEN AND FADES INTO THE DISTANCE, THE SEA, ALREADY CALM, GROWS MORE PEACEFUL STILL. SHORT WAVES SHOWER VAPOROUS FOAM ON THE LUKEWARM SHORE. THE SEA BIRDS HAVE DISAPPEARED. ALL THAT IS LEFT IS SPACE, OPEN TO A MOTIONLESS VOYAGE.

KNOWING THAT CERTAIN NIGHTS WHOSE SWEETNESS LINGERS WILL KEEP RETURNING TO THE EARTH AND SEA AFTER WE ARE GONE, YES, THIS HELPS US DIE. GREAT SEA, EVER IN MOTION, EVER VIRGIN, MY RELIGION ALONG WITH NIGHT! IT WASHES AND SATIATES US IN ITS STERILE BILLOWS, FREES US AND HOLDS US UPRIGHT. EACH BREAKER BRINGS ITS PROMISE, ALWAYS THE SAME. WHAT DOES EACH SAY? IF I WERE TO DIE SURROUNDED BY COLD MOUNTAINS, IGNORED BY THE WORLD, AN OUTCAST, AT THE END OF MY STRENGTH, AT THE FINAL MOMENT THE SEA WOULD FLOOD MY CELL, WOULD LIFT ME ABOVE MYSELF AND HELP ME DIE WITHOUT HATRED.

AT MIDNIGHT, ALONE ON THE SHORE. A MOMENT MORE, AND I SHALL SET SAIL. THE SKY ITSELF HAS WEIGHED ANCHOR, WITH ALL ITS STARS, LIKE THE SHIPS COVERED WITH LIGHTS WHICH AT THIS VERY HOUR THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ILLUMINATE DARK HARBORS. SPACE AND SILENCE WEIGH EQUALLY UPON THE HEART. A SUDDEN LOVE, A GREAT WORK, A DECISIVE ACT, A THOUGHT THAT TRANSFIGURES, ALL THESE AT CERTAIN MOMENTS BRING THE SAME UNBEARABLE ANXIETY, QUICKENED WITH AN IRRESISTIBLE CHARM. LIVING LIKE THIS, IN THE DELICIOUS ANGUISH OF BEING, IN EXQUISITE PROXIMITY TO A DANGER WHOSE NAME WE DO NOT KNOW, IS THIS THE SAME AS RUSHING TO OUR DOOM? ONCE AGAIN, WITHOUT RESPITE, LET US RACE TO OUR DESTRUCTION.

I HAVE ALWAYS FELT I LIVED ON THE HIGH SEAS, THREATENED, AT THE HEART OF A ROYAL HAPPINESS.

WHAT SHALL DRIVE A MAN TO SUICIDE? DESCEND INTO INSANITY, SICK MIND.. SICK BODY.. MOUTH IS NEITHER DRY NOR WET AND A NAUSEA SO INTENSLY DEBILITATING. I CANNOT BRING MYSELF TO DO ANYTHING, THERE IS NOTHING WITHIN ME. I AM COMPLETELY EMPTY. WHAT SHALL DRIVE ME TO FINALLY DIE? I HAVE ONCE AGAIN BEEN MADE AWARE OF MY OWN MORTALITY, AND OF OTHERS.. WHAT SHALL DRIVE ME TO FINALLY DIE? 

I STILL FIND MYSELF WRITING TO YOU.

WE ARE NEARING THE POINT OF NO RETURN
